Arjun will come
to the 'swayamvar
and get married to you.
This is what King Drupad wants.
And what do you want, Govind?
When competence gets awarded
I derive great satisfaction
from it, beloved.
And in the world,
does competence
solely belong to Arjun?
Certainly not.
How is it possible
for Mother Earth
to give birth to only one gem?
King of Anga, Karna, is also
competent.
If he takes part
in the competition
then he shall certainly win it.
Charvak too is a great archer
and the King of Matsya
is no less either.
Then who am I
supposed to wait for?
Only competence?
Is competence
the sole virtue, Govind?
Is competence the sole joy?
Is wishing for joy in a marriage
not correct?
Wishing for joy in a marriage...
One who wishes for joy
does not get it, Draupadi.
One who knows joy, gets it.
If you figure out
what joy means to you
then you shall indeed have joy.
Why do you never give
a definite answer, Govind?
A definite answer...
Because the efforts made
to have the answers
is called life.
Answers are another form
of salvation.
Nevertheless
as you are going
to the Shiv temple now
you should ask
Lord Shiva himself.
He is the Lord of Death
and Salvation.
That is why, He always
gives a definite answer.
If you are to get your answer
then you shall get it
only from Him.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Is there an inn in this city?
We wish to stay here
for a few days.
All the inns are full.
You will not find
any place to stay here.
Are you travellers?
- Yes.
We have come from
the village of Ekachakra.
We wish to go to Naimisharanya.
Are you 'Brahmins?
We have dressed up 'Brahmins.
Was that half the truth?
Yes
because I never lie.
But there is half a lie
in half the truth.
You are correct.
If I utter half the truth
ever again
then the Almighty
will punish me.
But I cannot tell the truth.
That is why,
do not ask questions.
Did the lady have something?
Come inside.
I shall arrange
for you to rest and dine.
But you must
allow us to serve you.
It is mandatory
otherwise we shall
not accept the alms.
I am a potter.
I am old.
It is difficult
to dig up the soil.
You are young.
You may dig the soil up
and I shall offer you
a place to rest and dine.
Then we shall serve you first.
Tell us from where
we need to dig up the soil.
We need to dig up the soil
to make pots
and not a mountain.
We need to dig up
a small amount of soil.
Any amount of soil you dig up
will be insufficient.
Our King is organizing
a 'swayamvar' for our Princess.
We have guests over
from all over the world.
Pots, earthen lamps and vessels
are required in great numbers.
The 'swayamvar
of Princess Shikhandini? - No.
The deities
of the fire sacrifice
have blessed our King
with a daughter.
Our Princess Draupadi is divine.
Her 'swayamvar' will begin
tomorrow at dawn.
The person who gets our Princess
will be most fortunate.
In order to make the pots
I require soil
from the river bank.
And in order to make the vessels
I require soil from behind
the Shiva temple.
I hope
I get a definite answer
from Mahadev.
Brother Bheem
since we are here, why do we not
pay homage to Mahadev?
You are correct.
Brahmins,' do have
the sacrament before leaving.
A small banquet
has been held outside.
Why? - Princess Draupadi is
coming here for the veneration.
Brother Bheem, we should leave.
Let us have something first.
This is not alms but a banquet.
If Shikhandini is also here,
she will recognize us.
We should leave.
Brother Bheem, let's go!
Brother Bheem, go and dig...
Brother Bheem.
- W-What?
Go and dig up the soil.
I shall go get the cart.
Go on, brother Bheem.
The aroma of food
is tempting me.
Prince Arjun, please let me go.
King Vrikodar
pay attention to your work.
Brother Bheem, in order
to make the vessels
we were asked to bring
soil from behind the temple.
Let me go get it.
Stop...
Let me go and get the soil.
I can do it, brother.
- No... Let me do it.
Brother Bheem, I can go get it.
You need not worry.
I shall go get it.
I shall be back soon.
- But...
I-I will go get it.
It seems, King Vrikodar was
unable to suppress his appetite.
Govind says, you always
give a definite answer.
Will I get my answer, My Lord?
Stop, Princess.
Let's go, Princess.
Princess Shikhandini has
asked us to return soon.
Brother Balaram!*
*Krishna's older brother, and so Arjun's cousin.
Aren't you Arjun?
Greetings, Bahrain!
Bless you.
Charioteer,
proceed in that direction!
Arjun!
Don't stop Rukmi.
Let him realize his destiny.
Faster!
Krishna!
Stop!
Stop fleeing like a thief!
Stop and fight me!
Welcome!
Welcome, brother-in-law Rukmi
and do accept my greetings
for the second time.
You scoundrel! Rukmini was
to marry Prince Shishupal!
Aren't you ashamed to run away
with someone else's property?
Goddess Lakshmi blesses
people with property
but she isn't
a property herself.
Similarly, every woman is the
embodiment of Goddess Lakshmi.
A woman has the power to
bless people with property.
Quit rambling, Krishna!
Pick up your weapon!
Why do you wish
to be defeated, Rukmi?
Go back and convey
to the King of Vidarbha
that his daughter and son-in-law
have sent their greetings.
Rukmini!
I order you to
get in my chariot!
No, brother. Henceforth,
all the roads of my life
lead to Dwaraka.
Pardon me, brother.
- Rukmini!
If you don't come along with me,
I will take your corpse with me!
Brother, I am now
in the shelter of Krishna.
Now, Lord Yama* himself cannot kill me.
*God of death.
Quit being stubborn
and go back, brother.
Listen to your sister, Rukmi.
Go back.
- Rukmini
you have insulted your brother
because of that man.
But he shall not
be with you forever!
You and he will be separated!
Do remember! You shall
certainly get separated!
Did you feel nothing
in your heart
while uttering such harsh
words about your sister?
I shall kill you for this
impudence of yours!
No, My Lord!
He is my brother.
Please don't kill him, My Lord.
But I shall
certainly punish him.
Greetings, Madhav.
What do you plan to do next?
- Plan?
My plan is quite simple, friend.
On the coast of Saurashtra
lies the city of Madhavpur
where Rukmini and I
are to be married.
We shall get married there
and after that...
After that, righteousness
will be re-established in India
unrighteous people will be slain
and the entire Aryan region
will be gifted with happiness.
That's it.
And will your marriage
accomplish all this, Madhav?
If not mine but yours might
just accomplish it, friend.
But you should be
prepared for it.
The course of time
can change because of you.
If I weren't your mother
how do I know what you like?
So what if I didn't
give you birth, son?
Wasn't I the one who raised you?
No, son!
Karna!
My son!
If you didn't give birth to me
who gave me birth,
mother Radha?
Who gave birth to me?
Who gave me birth?
Who gave me birth?
We do not know, son.
We were without a child.
We used to pray to
Goddess Ganga everyday
to bless us with a son.
And one day
Goddess Ganga
heard our prayers.
In a wicker basket
you were found by us.
Just like an offering
from the Goddess Ganga.
Whose son am I, father?
I do not know, son.
All the folks of Hastinapur say
that Krishna is an incarnation
of Lord Vishnu.
If he mentioned a name
it must be the truth, son.
It must be the truth.
This world knows me by the name
Radheya, mother Radha.
Now, which name do I respond to?
Which name do I respond to?
Grant me your leave,
supreme minister.
Forgive me, Krishna.
I gave you the invitation
to bring the peace proposal.
But it became the reason
for such grave insult of you.
It isn't your fault,
supreme minister.
Attempting to avoid
debt, disease and war
is always appropriate
irrespective of its outcome.
I made an attempt.
But as to who shall suffer
because of my failure
shall be evident soon.
The war is on the horizon.
We must soon
decide the venue for battle
and send a summon to Hastinapur
for battle.
Mother.
Being your guest
was a privilege.
And it has also been
the biggest pleasure of my life.
Grant me your leave, aunt.
Before the war, your sons
shall arrive to seek
your blessings.
My five sons have the privilege
of your protection, Krishna.
So, I do not worry about them.
If you ever feel worried
for someone
go tell him in person
to chose the side of justice.
Everyone invokes the clouds.
But it is said
that clouds arrive when called
upon by a peacock or a cuckoo.
Farewell!
Farewell!
You are not the son of
Adirath and mother Radha.
You are the son of
Queen Kunti.
So what if I didn't
give you birth, son?
Wasn't I the one
who raised you?
You are the spawn
of the Sun God himself.
You are the son of
Queen Kunti.
Karna, King of Anga,
is as good as your brother.
Son?
You may think of me
as your mother!
Princes who flaunt their
birth status like ornaments!
Remember!
In the battlefield
everyone shall be faced with
their courage and their lives!
And Arjun, if we ever
meet in the battlefield
your death shall surely occur
at my hands!
My dear!
My dear!
I have heard that
even Krishna has two mothers.
And Krishna respects and loves
both his mothers equally.
Why do you treat this as a blot
on your existence, my dear?
When one craves all his life
to see the other one suffer
and is then told that the other
is a reflection of his own
and that only when he suffers
even that mirror reflection
shall suffer as well
how can that person
stay calm,...
Vrushali?
I struggled all my life
to attain respect
worthy of my capability.
I rivaled against
the entire world.
I faced insults worse than death
at every step.
There was no need
for any of it, Vrushali.
There was no need
for any of it.
My dear.
Whom...
Whom are you talking about?
Arjun!
I had beheld Arjun as the
personification of my insults.
I told myself repeatedly
that the day I slay Arjun
the entire world will know
on that day
that even the son of charioteer
can be the best warrior
in the world.
But Arjun...
Arjun is my brother, Vrushali.
He is my younger brother.
Even I am the son of Kunti
like him.
I am not the son of Radha.
How do I deal with
this situation, Vrushali?
I am deeply indebted
to my friend Duryodhan.
How do I think of him as my foe?
I harbour nothing but fury
against Arjun.
How can I offer
my alliance to him?
What trickery is this
by Krishna?
When it was the time to get over
all the agony in my life
he has rendered me unarmed.
Those are my brothers, Vrushali!
Those are my brothers!
How can I wield a weapon
against them, Vrushali?
How can I do it?
How can I wield a weapon against
my brothers, Vrushali?
How can I wield a weapon against
my younger brothers?
My dear!
My dear!
My dear!
Only she can answer
all your questions
who is the root cause
of this situation.
My dear! Please...
Please approach Queen Kunti
and question Queen Kunti
if righteousness means
everything.
Your Majesty Kunti.
I wished to welcome you first
to Hastinapur with this lotus.
If you stand quietly this way
I shall deduce that you haven't
accepted this flower, O' Queen.
Any saint, any beseecher
any beggar or a wretched one...
Is anybody there
who can accept alms from me
and do me a favour?
Karna my son.
I am a beggar
and a wretched one too.
Here I am, your mother.
I have come here
hoping for charity.
Would you be able to
donate to her?
King Karna of Anga!
Greetings.
Have you come here
to look at our city?
Bless you, Arjun!
I have no interest in your city.
This maiden here is Vrushali.
By the time the subjects of
Hastinapur
were allowed to migrate
to Indraprastha
she had already left Hastinapur.
That is why,
she is your subject.
I am here
to drop her off safely.
And what arrangements have you
made for your safety King?
Did you forget
that our mother
has been imprisoned?
Not only mother
but also the subjects have been
imprisoned by Hastinapur.
The subjects have not been
imprisoned, Prince Sahadev.
Just to maintain order
in the kingdom
such a restriction has been
imposed on them for a while.
Crown Prince Duryodhan
will certainly
work towards the interest
of all his subjects.
And Prince Nakul
Queen Mother Kunti is not
a prisoner in Hastinapur
but a member
of the royal family.
It is her decision
not to come here.
That is a lie!
Why would our mother not come
to the reverence of our city?
Do not argue, Nakul.
The shadow of a container
does not have the right
to decide in which direction
its shadow should be cast.
All its life
the container
and the light decide its fate.
How would the King of Anga know
what the truth is
and what isn't?
He merely rotes what
brother Duryodhan says.
I have renounced the kingdom
of Anga, Arjun!
I am an ordinary subject now.
I have no obligation
to decline a duel with you
and neither do you!
Pick up your bow, Arjun!
Let us decide right away
who is superior amongst us!
Calm down, Maharathi Karna.
When there is a reason to fight
we will certainly
engage in a battle.
But at the moment
you are a guest of Indraprastha.
And the Pandavas will not
draw their weapons on a guest.
I do not require
your protection, Vasudev.
I am protected
by Lord Surya himself.
I am not here to serve
as a guest to the Pandavas
but to deliver their
mother's message to them.
She has sent the message
to become an independent state
right after the reverence
of the city.
Until Indraprastha
has a flag of its own
she will not enter this city.
Are you the only one who knows
this message, Maharathi Karna?
Did you not tell
your beloved friend?
I am a friend of the
Crown Prince Duryodhan
and not his spy.
Until all of you had
not heard this message
your being independent
was merely a suspicion.
And reporting suspicions
is the task of a spy.
But now
this is an information
and I will certainly
inform my friend about it.
And if there is a battle
then in order
to protect my friend
the first one
to take to arms will be me.
This is my duty.
Wonderful, Maharathi Karna.
This is what
we expected from you.
Do take this maiden
to her father.
Listen, maiden.
Is your name not Vrushali?
Another heroic man like him
does not exist in this world.
Before the distance between
you and him increases
if you like
you may go after him.
Maharathi Karna!
Maharathi Karna!
You never let a person go
empty-handed, Maharathi Karna.
Can I get something
in charity as well?
But I have nothing that I can
give you as charity, Vrushali.
Both the kingdom
and the royal treasury
have been renounced by me.
The last few coins left
had been strewn by me
on the river bank.
After renouncing
the royal treasury
what remains with you
is what I wish to have.
May I have
your companionship
as charity, Radheya?
Life with me will be
difficult, Vrushali.
With you
even a difficult life
will become easy, Radheya.
Will you let me walk with you?
Only if you guide me
will I let you.
Only a true warrior
can say that he is a friend
and not a spy.
King Karna of Anga
is an excellent warrior.
Till the two of them
are together
the maiden will be safe.
Till the two of them
are together
Maharathi Karna
will be safe, friend.
Uncle!
Karna has sent a message.
The Pandavas have decided
to perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna
to become independent, uncle!
We cannot stop them
but we can fight them.
Then we shall fight!
We will not fight.
If we fight them
then that sin
will be our cross to bear.
At the time of the division
both the parties had
promised each other
that they will
not attack the other.
Then what is the solution
to this, uncle?
When a river floods
it cannot be stopped.
But before the river floods
a dam can certainly
be built, my darling.
After the reverence
of their city
the Pandavas
can perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna
and we cannot stop them.
But
we can certainly stop
the reverence of the city.
One lakh cows
are going
to Indraprastha
for the reverence.
Before those cows
reach Indraprastha,
we must
stop them,
my darling.
But how, uncle?
The Serpent King Takshak.
Serpent King
one lakh cows
are going to Indraprastha
for the reverence of the city.
If you wish to have your revenge
then before those cows
reach Indraprastha
you should steal them
Serpent King Takshak.
My Lord
Takshak stole our cows and fled.
He fled northward with our
one lakh cows, My Lord!
He fled!
What about the security?
What about the soldiers?
- He bit all of them!
The reverence of the city is to
take place tomorrow, brother.
But without the cows
how can the reverence
be completed?
Uncle Shakuni
has come up
with a splendid plan.
Call Nakul.
Get all the soldiers treated.
Employ the serpents of the city
to draw the venom
out of the soldiers.
Ask brother Bheem to make
arrangements to guard the city.
With us busy
looking for the cows
they might intend
to attack the city!
Let me go get my bow.
Brother Arjun
your Gandiva Bow
is in Panchali's chamber!
Apart from brother Yudhishthir,
Panchali's chamber
is off-limits
for the rest of us.
For an entire year,
Draupadi
will be wife
to only one of you.
During that period
only that person can enter
Draupadi's chamber
to whom she gives
the right to do so.
Brother, if you enter
Panchali's chamber then...
Then...
Then I must
renounce Indraprastha
and go into an exile for years.
I know, Sahadev.
In order to protect the cows
if I leave the city tonight
I will be able to enter it only
after completing my penance.
But at the moment
this is my duty.
"The tenth day of war"
My child.
Till the end of this day.
We must repel grandsire
away from lady Shikhandini.
Once we find a chance.
We need to kill lady Shikhandini.
That's our goal today.
Lady Shikhandini!
The entire Kaurava army
will attempt to keep you
away from grandsire.
Their only intention
will be to kill you.
I and the whole Pandava army...
will shield you.
In order to get you.
They'll have to defeat all of us.
Warriors!
Today, we have one goal!
One objective and one plan.
We must aid Shikhandini
to get to grandsire by all means.
All these days anticipation which've been stymied. 
Grandsire's annihilation.
Today, we must lift our effort manifold.
In order to protect her.
Today, before sunset.
We must make grandsire...
lay down his weapon by all means.
Hail Mahadev.
Your survival essential
for my victory, grandsire.
My dead is essential 
for my liberation.
I will not let you die, 
grandsire.
Though you are present
on the battlefield,
the Pandava army will never
be able to reach to you.
A walls made of bamboo,
can stop the wind
but not hurricane.
Look there.
Soldiers!
Attack!
Attack!
Hail Mahadev!
This is mandatory to stop
Arjuna and Vasudev, friend.
If we don't stop them.
They will aid lady Shikhandini
reach grandsire.
The only person who can
confront Arjuna...
is the one who taught 
him in warfare.
Arjuna, accept this gesture.
If you get defeated.
I will be proud of my capability.
If you win, I will be proud
of my teaching.
Give me a reason to be proud.
- Pick up your weapon.
- Master!
Not even Lord Indra can stop me.
For getting lady Shikhandini
to grandsire today.
Today, you'll have to satisfy yourself,
with the pride of your teaching.
And accept your death by my hands.
Death is decided only by God.
You ought to accept your defeat by my hands.
Nobody can stop me from getting to
Grandsire today.
Nakul.
Ashwathama is fighting a duel 
with Lady Shikandini.
We must help him.
Soldiers.
Direct the launchers towards Bheem.
Crush Bheem's army.
Go to Grandsire,
I will keep Ashwathama busy.
Master's son, Ashwathama.
My sword is desperate to get
introduced to you.
What are you waiting for?
Before facing Grandsire you must 
fight a duel with me.
My brother spared your life 
in the Panchal war.
But I am not as kind as him.
Death's the only punishment 
I can offer you.
Get to Grandsire.
Dusshasan should also get a chance.
To use his spear to fight.
Pick up the spear, Dusshasan.
Let your brother realize that 
you are a warrior.
What is the situation, Sanjay?
When is the sunset?
Three more hours, Your majesty.
Lady Shikhandini is wounded.
And is trying to progress towards Grandsire,
your majesty.
In these hours.
Lady Shikhandini should be unsuccessful
in all attempts.
If Grandsire's death is avoided.
Our army's victory will be inevitable.
Yes.
Where is Lady Shikhandini?
You have the body of a man.
But you...
You still battle like a woman!
my lady.
Just look at you.
Your entire body is scarlet 
with blood.
Your breath seeks permission
to leave your body.
However...
Your heart...
Your heart does not allow you to forget 
taking your revenge.
Take the decision to live, 
My Lady.
I shall allow you to leave 
the battlefield.
Revenge is the sole aim
of this birth of mine.
Remembering it is the 
basis of my life.
To my darling Duryodhan. His Excelency Bhisma's life is very important, My Lady!
However, to ensure His Excellency 
Bhishma's life,
your death is not mandatory.
This is why, I only need to hold you 
off till sundown.
After which, neither will you be
able to enter the battlefield.
Nor will dream of victory 
of the Pandavas.
His Excellency is looking constantly 
at the sun, Your Highness.
As though he wish to prevent the sun from setting in the sky just for a little while.
Where is Shikhandi, Sanjay?
King of Gandhar is holding
Shikhandi off, majesty.
Guru Drona is not allowing Prince Arjuna 
to move forth, Your Highness.
Prince Nakula is battling
Ashwathama, Your Highness.
Crown Prince Duryodhan is hurling rocks at 
Prince Bheem, Your Highness.
All the Pandavas are miles away from 
Shikhandi, Your Highness.
Those Pandavas are the armour 
of Shikhandi, Sanjay.
If Shikhandi is away from this armour.
Reaching uncle is impossible 
for him, Sanjay.
It's impossible.
In other words...
In other words,
our army win.
You will see, Vidur. King of Gandhar 
will not fail.
Never.
My victory is a boon granted 
by Mahadev himself.
You cannot render it futile,
King Shakuni of Gandhar.
In order to realize Mahadev boon,
you will have to be born 
again, My Lady.
The birth of yours
was futile!
Lady Shikhandini!
"An injured Shikhandi is being
taken by Prince Abhimanyu"
"to the camp of the Pandavas,
Your Highness."
He has lost a lot of blood.
His life is in danger,
Your Highness.
Splendid.
Splendid, Sanjay.
Splendid!
In other words
if Shikhandi is injured
then he will not be able to battle.
And if he is not present before uncle
then killing uncle will be
impossible.
Mother Draupadi!
Sister!
Mother Draupadi,
he has lost a lot of blood.
Take her over there.
Abhimanyu, go and call your uncles 
Nakul and Sahadev
to camp at once.
Only their special
herbs can heal sister.
Leave at once!
Friend
the sun is about to set.
Did Shikhandi
reach grandsire or not?
Shikandi is merely the cause.
Your weapons shall be of use in this.
You need to focus
your attention on your duty.
At the moment,
it is your duty
to defeat Guru Drona.
Mother-in-law,
his breathing is irregular!
Why are my lords Nakul and Sahadev
not here yet?
Mother-in-law,
do something!
No!
Without fulfilling one's oath
no one has the right to die,
sister!
Get up!
Get up, sister!
Get up!
Try to recall, sister...
Try to recall
your meditation.
Try to recall your oath,
sister.
Try to recall
Mahadev's blessing.
Sister!
Get up, sister!
Get up, sister!
Lord Parashuram
had taken to arms for you!
Today,
you must take to arms!
Get up, sister.
Sister!
When lightning strikes in the sky
it indeed wreaks
havoc on earth.
You are like a powerful weapon
borne by a God, sister.
You are Indra's "vajra"!
Get up, sister.
Get up and wreak havoc!
Get up,
sister!
Get up,
sister!
Get up!
You are the basis of victory
in this war of righteousness.
Sister!
Sister,
you must get up!
Sister!
Get up,
sister.
I'll give you whatever
you desire.
Till I don't give
you the guru-donation
I will not use the skills
I derived from you.
As a guru-donation
you will give me
the thumb of your right hand.
Here, I have brought
a gift for you.
Just check.
You will be very pleased.
Are you happy?
Is your soul at peace
having an innocent's
thumb chopped off?
What do you mean?
- What do I mean?
Go and ask the master
who to make you an expert archer
asked Ekalavya for his
thumb as an offering.
So that better archers than you
can't even fire arrows now.
What are you saying,
brother Duryodhan?
You should be ashamed of making
allegations at the master.
You should be the one
to be ashamed.
To prove your superiority
you make one suffer thus?
Has your recluse of a father
taught you such strategies?
Take a look at
the chopped thumb.
Someone's dreams
lie destroyed.
His future has been chopped off
just because of you!
Along with that your
righteousness
and your respect has been
laid to waste too.
Arjun, dew drops can't
fill up a reservoir.
Superiority attained in
charity has no value.
Had I been in your stead
I would have taken an oath
to never touch the bow.
Right now!
You can ask me anything.
Aren't you confident
about me, master?
Can't I become the best
archer through practice?
What concerns me is how much
you believe in your master.
Have you assumed that
to make you superior
I am being impartial to my
other students?
The clouds shower more
rains on the forests
and less on the deserts.
But a master's knowledge
is never biased.
So the master is termed
superior to the clouds.
Then why such an offering
from Ekalavya?
What offering should a master
ask from his students
can be rightfully decided
only by a master.
But, master, why ask for an
offering which is a disgrace?
I know
that the sons of Dhritarashtra
would accuse me of being biased.
Not only them
the future generations would
also accuse me of being biased.
Arjun, I was helpless
before my duty.
Ekalavya would have used my
knowledge for Magadha
which is an enemy of
the Kuru dynasty.
Can the boundaries of a kingdom
control knowledge, master?
No.
But the master delivering
the knowledge
is bounded by his oath
and his promises.
My mouth eats the grains
given by the Kuru kingdom.
So my loyalty is only towards
the throne of Hastinapur.
Had Ekalavya attained knowledge
from another master
and become a better
archer than you
I would have been pleased.
But...
But the allegations
made on you...
How would they
be cleared, master?
There is one solution, dear.
You should prove undisputedly
that you are the best.
Why just Ekalavya?
Even Bhishma can't be
a better archer than you.
Prove it, dear.
Prove it.
If you do that
I will get rid of
the allegations.
Ashwatthama, my friend.
We are here to seek
your permission.
Permission?
We, the sons of Dhritarashtra,
are leaving the seminary.
We were fortunate to find a
friend like you at the seminary.
But we are sure
we will not attain anything
more than this here.
Moreover
can you attain anything
when Arjun is here?
I have my doubts on that.
What is the matter son?
You look a bit ill.
Father, I want the weapon
created by Brahma.
Today.
Lord Brahma's weapon?
Son, to attain the weapon, you
have to prove your credentials.
Isn't being your son
enough?
Before you give Brahma's
weapon to Arjun
I want it, father.
Son, I haven't taught Arjun
about Brahma's weapon yet.
You are already teaching
him the mantras.
Why are you so partial to Arjun?
Thanks to the partiality
the sons of Dhritarashtra are
quitting the seminary today.
Due to the partiality,
the seminary will be shut soon.
Your son is displeased
with the partiality.
If water stored
in a pot smells foul
then surely someone has
dirtied it.
If you are displeased,
I am sure
you are being supported
by ineligible people.
But still
I have to clear the doubts in
the minds of your friends.
Because I can never see you
hurt and displeased ever.
Never.
Go tell the sons of
Dhritarashtra
Dronacharya will
take a bath in the river
and take an oath to
be unbiased.
Everyone should assemble
at the river bank.
Father! - Master!
- Master!
Master!
Master!
Master!
- Dushashan!
Go bring my weapon Dushashan!
So?
Do all of you wish to
quit the seminary?
You can surely go.
You have my permissions.
But remember
to collect more water
from a stream
one needs a bigger vessel.
And to attain more knowledge
from a master
one needs to have
a broader mind.
A fertile mind is attained
only with dedication.
If you leave from here today
you will surely be very
less eligible.
And if you stay back
it is possible
that you may develop a
better mind to learn more.
The decision is up to you.
Arjun is the best student
of the seminary.
So he will become
the best archer of the world.
All the students attaining
knowledge from a master
do not attain the same
kind of knowledge.
All students are seen
listening to the master
they are seen worshipping him
but can't attain the same
kind of knowledge.
Have you ever thought as to why
does that happen?
The truth is
that the students who do
not attain knowledge
try to exhibit dedication
but they do not understand
the real meaning of dedication.
By offering flowers on
a master's feet
or by following the
master's orders
is dedication
actually proven?
No.
Dedication
is achieved indeed when
one has no doubts about
the master.
A student should finish the task
even before a master instructs.
A student and a
master should think alike.
Until a student doesn't
see the forms of Lord Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh*
*One of the many names of Shiva.
within their master
until then his dedication
isn't true.
In reality, dedication
isn't a task.
Dedication is the feeling
of our heart
and a state of mind.
In other words...
Isn't our ignorance
only because our mind
is at fault?
Think about it.
Servant!
Bring that maid Draupadi
in this royal court.
Handmaid
what's the news?
It's a sad news, Your Highness.
For a lady divested
of the title of the empress
has no end to her
pain and insult.
What do you mean?
Your Highness
you've been ordered at once to
be present at the royal court.
Who the heck are you?
How dare you enter my room
without permission!
Fool!
Get out of here!
I am the charioteer
of Emperor Duryodhan.
Please come along to abide by
Emperor Duryodhan's order.
My husband has lost
merely the game of gambling
not his life!
I don't take anyone's orders
apart from my husbands.
But the slaves don't have rights
to order, Your Highness.
King Yudhishthira had lost
himself in the gambling
along with you.
Now you are
Emperor Duryodhan's maid.
Please come.
Go and tell Duryodhan
that Empress Draupadi refuses
to be lost by Yudhishthira
in the game of gambling.
The already cut down tree
can neither grow
new leaves in the spring
nor can lose them in the autumn.
If Yudhishthira
had already lost himself
in the gambling
he had no right to stake me!
Go
tell Duryodhan.
Go!
Draupadi is right,
Your Highness.
If Yudhishthira had already
lost himself in the gambling
he had no right
to stake his wife.
That means
when Yudhishthira lost himself
along with his property
he lost even his wife.
No.
It's the person
who has a right on the property
not vice versa.
The husband
as well as the wife
both have a right on each other.
A wife,
certified by the scriptures
and revered by the society
can never be taken
as her husband's property.
Therefore, the moment
Yudhishthira lost himself
he had not lost Draupadi.
That means, neither
Yudhishthira lost Draupadi
nor did he have a right
to lose her.
Is that what
all of you want to prove?
In that case, all of you let
an utmost inequity take place
in this royal court.
None of you has a right
to be in this royal court.
Karna... - Please calm down,
Master Drona.
You won't get answer to such a
difficult question like this.
We must ask
the most righteous person
for this answer.
Tell me, slave Yudhishthira.
Your silence
will be taken as falsity.
Tell me.
Was losing Draupadi right
or wrong?
Please remain mum, brother.
Please don't mind committing
such a petty inequity, today.
But please remain mum.
Speak up, slave Yudhishthira.
Was staking Draupadi right
or wrong?
If...
If losing my four brothers
was right
then losing Draupadi
wasn't wrong.
What have you done, brother!
Did you pay heed, Master Drona?
Dushasan
bring that handmaid
in the royal court.
If that egoistic lady
refuses to accept my order
hold her by her hair
and bring over here, dragging.
Dushasan!
If you even touch her
I would kill you!
Keep quiet!
Just keep quiet, slave!
You can't do anything.
You are bound by dharma.
I have attained
that slave Draupadi
as per the dharma.
To heck with your dharma!
Don't forget, Duryodhan
that God lies in 'Shivlinga'*
*Symbolic rock of Shiva.
but upon hitting with the stone
it yields the sparks!
I will burn you to ashes!
Stop yelling
slave Arjun.
If you want to commit
the wrong
go ahead.
Even we want to witness
how you insult
your elder brother Yudhishthira.
Tell Yudhishthira
that you don't accept
the limit set by him.
Tell him
that you have nothing
to do with his defeat.
Take your weapons
and leave this royal court!
We will set you free.
Go!
Dushasan, go.
Bring that handmaid
in this royal court.
Your Highness
Prince Dushasan
is entering your room.
Handmaid Draupadi
you were ordered to be present
in the royal court!
Don't cross your limit, Prince!
Even the entire farm
of dried straws
can't bind
even the smallest ember.
In the same way,
you hundred brothers
will burn to ashes!
Shut up, slave Draupadi!
Your five husbands
have already been shut up
by Emperor Duryodhan.
Come!
I warn you, Prince.
You will have to face the
consequences of this insolence.
Consequences'!
It is the desire of bearing
the consequences
for which you're being
called to the court.
Wicked man!
Wicked man!
How dare you insult me?
If you have the guts
then take the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru lineage
in the presence
of the empress.
You scoundrel!
My curse will destroy you.
No!
Come!
- You scoundrel!
Leave me!
Your freedom!
Your honour!
Yudhisthira lost everything.
Come!
Leave me, you wicked man...
Dushasana! 
The hands that have dared
to touch Draupadi's pious hair...
I vow to rip those hands off!
Dushasana
when one's pride
is destroyed
it is the face that is
blackened first.
Let me see this
proud woman's face.
Vidur
I will not be returning to
Hastinapur with you.
No, Queen Mother
you cannot take such
a big decision.
Hastinapur needs you.
No, Vidur.
My endeavours have
been completed.
Just like when a finger
is removed from the water
the void space is filled
my existence too
has been reduced
to the same.
Now because of me
there will be no void
place in Hastinapur.
Please leave, Vidur.
In Ved Vyas' seminary
I shall spend the rest
of my life.
Please take Pandu's sons
and return to
Hastinapur.
Mother...
- Vidur...
This...is the order
of the Queen Mother.
Vidur
the Queen Mother has
one last order.
I had come here
to take the Kuru empire's
emperor along with me.
And you...
You are taking Kuru empire's
emperor along with you.
After today, it's
your responsibility
that Hastinapur's throne
sees Yudhishtir
as its king.
Go, Vidur.
Citizens!
The bereavement of Kuru empire's
former emperor, Pandu's death
can never be
forgotten.
But now
it's Emperor Dhritarashtra's
orders
that the one month long
bereavement period
has ended today.
Hence, in the entire
Kuru empire
business and trade
rituals
and blissful occasions
can begin all
over again.
And in this regard
His Highness has announced
the first celebration.
Two days from now
Prince Duryodhan's
enthronement as
the Crown Prince
will take place
in the assembly.
The public has
been ordered
that on this blissful
occasion
the entire Kuru empire
may have festivities.
King Dhritarashtra!
King Dhritarashtra!
King Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Pandu!
Child, it's not,
Hail King Pandu'.
It's 'Long live King Pandu'.
Long live King Pandu.
Long live King Pandu.
Long live King Pandu.
It's twelve again...
- Kind attention!
His Excellency Bhishma
is arriving!
Disperse!
Greetings, grandsire.
Greetings.
You should have
called for me.
I have come here
to play the game of dice,
Gandhar Prince.
I have heard
that a game of dice
offers peace to the mind.
Peace...
Peace!
Definitely, Your Excellency.
But still
you could have
called for me.
Why did you take
the trouble of coming here?
I haven't taken
any trouble.
My shoulders have been
burdened with troubles.
Whose was so impudent,
Your Excellency?
By the orders
of His Highness
I will have him prisoned.
I can do this myself,
Prince Shakuni.
A deceiver of
the Kuru lineage and empire
can be reduced to cinders by me
just by my gaze.
And to do this task
you don't even require
the permission
of His Highness!
Be seated,
Your Excellency.
Please...
Please have a seat.
Who will throw the dice first,
Your Excellency? - Me!
Because
Prince
you have begun
many a game already.
Your scores aren't sufficient,
Your Excellency.
How many points are
sufficient, Prince Shakuni?
A minimum of
six points,
Your Excellency.
Do you have the requisite score?
Indeed, I do,
Your Excellency.
One.
King Pandu has passed
away, Your Excellency
hence King Dhritarashtra is
no more the de facto king.
He is now
the Emperor.
Two.
King Dhritarashtra
loves his son a lot.
Three.
His Highness has complete
faith in my devotion.
Four.
His Highness' orders
for you, are tantamount
to God's testament
Your Excellency.
Five.
People's associations
are misguided now
due to the absence
of the Chief Minister.
Six.
The Emperor's satisfaction
lies in
Duryodhan's enthronement
as the Crown Prince.
Now let me disclose my
six points to you
Prince Shakuni.
One.
As per Kuru empire's traditions
before a prince
completes his education
a coronation ceremony
is unviable.
Two.
Without
the people's associations
ministry
and the justice council
being consulted
even the king can't
take a decision on his own.
Three.
Pandu has passed away.
But Queen Mother is still alive.
Four.
Your father, King Subal,
seems to be unhealthy.
Returning to Gandhar
and managing the kingdom
are your foremost duties now.
Five.
I have vowed to protect
the Kuru throne.
And, six.
Orders not to kill you
haven't yet been given to me
by His Highness.
One more thing.
Whether it's Dhritarashtra's
son becoming the king
or Pandu's, I shall not
be partial to either of them.
But Kuru empire's tradition
shan't be broken either.
Prince Shakuni
I am aware
that Dhritarashtra is
heavily influenced by you.
Until Pandu's sons
don't return
the coronation of
the Crown Prince shan't happen.
Please convey the same
to him, yourself.
Or else, do remember,
Prince Shakuni.
An elephant stops in its tracks
on spotting a mouse.
That accounts for compassion,
not weakness.
Disperse.
My Lord,
I have a request.
If it's regarding Duryodhan's
coronation, let it be.
I have already decided.
How could you decide without
consulting the Chief Minister?
Chief Minister?
The one who had objected to
my coronation
will never let my son
be coronated!
I trust Vidur.
He is never unjust...
You could trust him,
Gandhari
because you weren't
born sightless
rather you've just
blindfolded yourself!
But I was born blind.
My distrust is my wealth
and my power!
Thus, instead of trusting
and regretting later
I prefer distrusting and getting
my wishes fulfilled!
Right, Shakuni?
Didn't I speak the truth?
- Indeed, Your Highness.
But does His Highness distrust
his son too? - Shakuni!
The subjects say so,
Your Highness.
It's the hearsay of the subjects
as to what such was an urgency
to coronate the prince
as the Crown Prince.
Or if His Highness was so weak
to have his desire fulfilled
through the Chief Minister.
Is Vidur the de jure king?
Your Highness, my heart
was shattered on hearing this.
But mere subjects
have less wit
and more power. What can
be done? - What do you mean?
Your Highness, I mean, only
after the Chief Minister returns
do we announce the Crown Prince.
- But, Shakuni, you had said...
I was an imbecile,
Your Highness. A mere fool.
Whilst worrying about
your well-being
I guided you over to
a path leading to sorrows.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Forgive me.
But the rumours within a city
are like the stench of garbage.
They ride the winds
and go about.
Now your prestige deems it,
Your Highness
that in a packed assembly
you get the Chief Minister
to announce the Crown Prince.
So that it's made apparent to
the subjects of the province
that you are their king
in actuality.
But, Your Highness,
the question still stays
that if the Chief Minister
could be enforced to
make this announcement.
If Vidur refuses
to announce
I shall have him decapitated!
I am a king
not a puppet to be
pulled around by strings.
Your Highness.
I'm not able to understand
why you changed your colours.
But the impeding of coronation
benefitted the Kuru lineage.
My intentions aren't
any such, dear Gandhari.
I have changed just my colours
not my oath.
The king to the throne
of Hastinapur
will be Duryodhan only.
At any cost.
Any at all.
Don't go, Karna.
Son, even if you
do learn archery
what could you
possibly achieve by that?
Think about your mother
for a moment. Don't go, son.
I have promised you, mother.
I will return soon
after I have mastered
all skills.
No, son.
Now you will never return,
Karna.
Kuru province doesn't harbour
any Suta warrior.
But, my lord...
Why are you asking my son
to give up his homeland?
This is the desire
of His Excellency.
That Karna fulfils
the probability he was born for.
He wishes to master archery.
So he must give it a try.
I do not just wish
to achieve mastery!
In this very land,
within these very people
I wish to be hailed
as a maestro!
What use is success,
unless people accept it?
I am going to attain knowledge,
father.
Tradition being the pretense to
destroy my skill, isn't a right
of the Kuru empire subjects.
I am leaving Hastinapur
only for a short while.
I am not giving up
the Kuru land.
I shall live in this very
Kuru province.
One among the skill centres
of Kuru province
will be my alma mater.
This is my solemn oath.
That means, you will clash
with the subjects?
A toad doesn't grow big enough
by puffing out its cheeks
that it may clash with a bull.
That is what I wish to discover,
father.
Am I a toad or a Taurus?
Even if I waste a lifetime in
a quest to discover my calibre
I shall gladly accept it.
Bless me, mother.
Father
I shall prove Your Excellency
Bhishma's advice wrong
and return soon.
And I will live right here,
in Hastinapur
lifelong.
Son...
The head that bows before others
has no right to bear a crown.
I cannot stand this
unrighteousness any longer!
King Dhritarashtra,
before an earthquake
the mere sound of its arrival
makes even the smallest
of birds shudder.
But even after hearing
of such unrighteousness
did your heart
not quiver even once?
The Almighty may not have
given you vision
but He certainly has
given you ears.
Unrighteousness!
What unrighteousness,
Great Guru Drona?
The rules of this game
were made in your presence.
Has anyone broken those rules?
King Dhritarashtra
you are indeed unable to see
the impending calamity.
Very soon, you will be
so grieved to be blind
which you would
have never felt before.
Leave this court at once,
Great Guru Drona
otherwise I shall take revenge
for this insult this instant!
Friend Duryodhan
now
you may bet me in the game.
I accept the right
you have on me
but I
have a request.
If you lose
then sentence me to death.
I cannot live the life
of a servant!
What are you saying,
son?
Father
I am standing by my friend.
Duryodhan my friend,
you may bet me in the game!
I bet my friend Ashwatthama
in the game.
He is like
a brother to me.
Great Guru Drona
you have been ordered
to leave this court
by His Highness.
As my son has been
bet in this game
I cannot leave this place.
Then you may certainly grace
this court, Great Guru Drona.
I too shall forget
how I was insulted
but you must promise me
that henceforth
you will never leave
the court of Hastinapur.
Promise me!
I promise you.
Then do be seated, Guru Drona.
Be seated.
Now, if the Emperor wishes
then he may bet
another brother of his.
Brother...
The opportunity
to get sacrificed first
was snatched by Nakul from me.
This time,
I shall bet myself.
No, brother Arjun.
It is crucial for brother Bheem
and you to stay independent.
Please try to understand
this foreboding feeling
that I have.
I fear that
something gravely unrighteous
will happen in this court today.
Please stop that.
May the Emperor have happiness!
Do play, Your Highness.
Do play.
King Ashwatthama of Kampilya
has been bet this time
and your younger brother,
the son of Lady Madri, Sahadev
needs to be bet by you.
This is not a game
but a revenge for something.
Sister-in-law
if you have an iota of shame
a sense of pride in your dynasty
or even an iota of righteousness
within yourself
then stop this game
this instant!
I...
I am merely an embankment
made of sand, Kunti.
Today, the unrighteousness
of Duryodhan
has assumed the form of a flood.
I will crumble
but will not be able
to stop this flood.
You are bound to crumble,
Your Highness.
The day your sons will be
punished for this treachery
you will indeed crumble.
I am the Empress
of the entire Aryan region.
The order to stop this game
shall be given by me.
Gatekeeper
the rules of the game
are very clear.
Women of royalty
are not allowed in this court!
Crown Prince Duryodhan
no order is a constraint
for an Empress.
Stop this game,
Your Highness.
This gathering is unrighteous!
This game is unrighteous!
Do not play this game.
Get up, Your Highness.
That is not possible,
Your Highness.
You have agreed
to play this game.
You are bound by your word.
Break that promise!
When an ironsmith gets entangled
in the chains while making them
he ends up breaking them,
Your Highness.
An iron chain is not
considered an ornament.
When the Gandiva Bow
of Prince Arjun is on your side
and even the mace
of Vrikodar Bheem
who are you afraid of then?
Dear Yudhishthir
lest you lose your throne
I had
come up with these rules
but now,
these very rules
have resulted in these
repercussions.
Get up, dear.
Get up, dear Yudhishthir.
Get up.
Panchali is correct,
brother Yudhishthir.
Do get up.
Just give me the order!
I shall free Nakul this instant!
May the Emperor have happiness!
Your Highness, despite being
a guest in my court
you will attack me?
Are you willing to challenge
my competence?
Bheem
it is my duty
to honour my promises.
I cannot order you
to resort to arms here.
That is your duty as a person,
brother Yudhishthir
and we respect it
but as the Emperor,
you have another duty
towards the Aryan region
and all the Kings who
have accepted your reign.
How will you
carry out that duty?
Arjun
it is your duty to obey the
orders of your elder brother.
You might as well
disregard that duty.
Just say that you disobey the
orders of your elder brother.
Nakul
why are you kneeling down there?
Your elder brother
is playing this game.
Why should you
accept its result?
Just say no.
None of you can give up
your righteous ways.
Do play,
Your Highness.
Do play.
I have bet Ashwatthama
and you need to bet Sahadev.
Your Highness
you had said that you
would lose your property
your empire
and even your throne
but you have lost
my husband instead.
Is this what you call
righteousness?
Do play, Your Highness.
Do play.
Stop!
It is a rule
that in the presence
of women of royalty
this game shall not be played.
I shall stay right here.
May the Empress have happiness!
Your Highness,
I request you
to leave this court.
Apart from my husbands
I am not bound to take orders
from anyone else
King Dhritarashtra.
Splendid.
Splendid,
Your Highness.
Splendid.
Your Highness, do you wish to
seek the refuge of the Empress
to break your promise?
Splendid!
If the foot of a person
climbing up a mountain slips
he ends up straight
in the trench.
To a righteous person
even the smallest
of an unrighteous deed
can make him fall
in the trench of sins.
Now, you should
order the Empress
to leave this court
otherwise
we shall leave.
My darling
let's go.
We must end this game.
My darling
let's go!
Stop,
brother Duryodhan.
Panchali
leave this court.
Dear Draupadi...
Dear Draupadi,
what happened?
What happened in the court?
Leave!
It is my order
for the both of you to leave.
I require some solitude.
And no one will go to the court!
My husband is engaged in
honouring righteousness there.
Vishnu, who blesses
the whole universe
requests for your blessings.
Accept me as your son, mother.
I am taking my son to Gokul.
He will be safe
under the protection
of my friend Nand.
- But...
But how, Your Highness?
The prison gates are locked.
A battalion of soldiers
is standing outside.
It is raining so heavily.
The River Yamuna
must have flooded.
Under such circumstances,
how will we take
our new born son
to Gokul?
No, Your Highness. No!
Who can stop the Almighty,
Devaki?
Bless your son.
What a terrible night,
Vasudev!
Yes, my friend Nand.
It is the most terrible night
of my life
when I am asking my friend
for such a great sacrifice.
You are not asking me for it,
Vasudev.
It is time, which is asking
for the sacrifice.
Before the sun rises
every night seems
to be extremely dark.
But the sun definitely rises.
My wife Yashoda
has given birth
to our daughter tonight.
Take her with you
and hand your son over,
under my protection.
Please reconsider, Nand.
Possibly, Kans will kill
your daughter.
In that case,
the whole universe would be
beholden to my daughter.
Here, Vasudev.
Take her with you.
Vasudev.
Take her with you.
Your Highness, a boy
has been born.
She is my friend Nand's
daughter.
Daughter, Your Highness?
In that case, brother will
not kill her, will he?
Devaki! Where is
your eight offspring?
Your son. My nemesis!
Where is he?
No, brother. It's not a son.
I have given birth
to a daughter.
No, brother. It's not a son.
I have given birth
to a daughter.
Daughter!
How is that possible?
Your eighth child
your son will be
the cause of my death.
That was the prophecy.
How did you give birth
to a daughter?
How is this possible?
I had told you
to ignore the prophecy
and refrain from committing
this sin.
You have committed the sin
of killing six infants,
Your Highness.
God wants to show you
the right path.
Hence, Devaki's seventh child
was not born
and the eighth child
is a daughter.
Give me your daughter,
Devaki.
No, brother!
Do not be so stone-hearted.
What could my daughter
possibly do to you?
Spare the life of at least
one of my children.
Have mercy!
Foolish Devaki
had I not promised Vasudev
I would have killed you too,
at this very moment.
I can't spare the life
of your eighth child.
No matter if it is
a boy or a girl
I have to kill it!
Give me the child!
- No, let her go.
Let her go.
- Let me go!
No... Brother, she is innocent.
Let her go.
- Devaki's eight child...
Brother, let her go.
- You are my nemesis.
No...
- Brother!
Let me go! No!
Now, the prophecy
will be proven wrong.
No! No...
Brother... Let my daughter go.
Let her go!
Brother! Brother!
Brother, no.
Let my daughter go.
Let her go! No!
No!
- Brother!
Enemy of the Yadav clan, Kans
your wickedness has crossed
all boundaries.
But don't forget.
The moon does get eclipsed.
But the eclipse doesn't last
for very long.
Even you will not live
for much longer.
The boy who will punish you
is safe.
And at the right time,
he will slay you.
The boy who will punish you
is safe.
And at the right time,
he will slay you.
Did Yogmaya* once again merge with Vishnu, uncle?
*Goddess Yogmaya, the sister of Krishna.
No, Abhimanyu.
To establish lawfulness,
Lord Vishnu's Yogmaya
keeps manifesting herself.
Sometimes in the form of power,
sometimes, devotion
and sometimes,
as a person.
How did you make
this miracle take place
as soon as you were born, uncle?
Sutsom, being
born as a mortal
cannot perform miracles.
One who is born
of a woman's womb
is bound by the rules
of a mortal body.
He cannot escape
birth, old age
disease and death.
But a miracle
did take place, uncle.
It definitely did, Satanik.
But that miracle
was performed by God.
When every person heartily feels
the need to put an end
to anarchy and establish
a lawful society...
When sin crosses
every boundary...
Then
God performs miracles
to protect morality.
To establish lawfulness,
when a person
gives up his selfishness
and attachment
and becomes ready to sacrifice
the whole creation gets filled
with miracles.
Because of the sacrifices
made by my mothers
Devaki and Yashoda
a miracle took place
in that prison, dear.
This is the balance of creation.
But God only performs miracles
when there is unlawfulness
all around
yet, lawfulness resides
in the people's hearts.
So that human beings
never fear struggle.
Whenever a person
battles sin even with
his last iota of power
God performs miracles
to protect him.
Even during the dice game
the Pandavas were subjected
to a lot of injustice.
But they never resorted
to unlawfulness.
Even after so much humiliation,
pain and oppression
your mother
did not accept defeat.
That's why, God performed
a miracle.
This means that if you wish
to seek help from the universe
this creation and God
then first of all
give up your selfishness
and attachment
and learn to fight
against the circumstances!
Am I not right, my friend?
Along with lac,
this palace is made
with dried grass,
clarified butter and cotton.
If this palace catches fire
everything will get burnt
within six hours.
This is a scheme to burn
us alive in the palace.
Father
the remaining Pandavas
have figured out
that the entire palace
is made of lac.
Purandiri, seek permission
from Her Highness
to go and get more food
from the kitchen.
You have my permission.
You may go and get it.
But we have already given them
all the food, My Lord.
Be quiet.
Our plan has been foiled.
We must torch this place.
We must get out of here at once!
Let's go.
We need to discuss
this with mother.
But I do not understand,
brother Yudhishthir.
What must have Duryodhan
thought about this place?
If this place is torched,
will we not be able to escape?
Is he a fool?
Brother Arjun can extinguish
an entire forest fire
using a single 'Varunastra'.*
*The water weapon (a storm) incepted by Varuna--the god of the water and of the celestial ocean, as well as a god of law of the underwater world.
He might not have
thought about it.
He did.
He has put quite a bit
of thought into it, brother.
The mouse died
upon eating the 'kheer'.
Mother, begin eating.
They must be on their way.
No, let them arrive.
At least, allow me to feed you
some 'kheer', mother.
No, Bheem.
You may have it.
Besides, a mother eats only when
her children are done eating.
No, mother. You must allow me
to feed you some 'kheer'.
Alright.
Go ahead.
But I have a fear, mother.
When you feed me,
I feel satiated.
What if I feel satiated
upon feeding you?
That is impossible,
my Vrikodar.
If that happens, I shall not be
able to eat when you feed me.
And I have committed no sin
that the Almighty will
punish me that harshly.
Now, feed me.
Open your mouth.
That 'kheer' has been
poisoned, mother!
Yes, mother.
The mouse died upon eating it.
Mother, get up. This palace
might get torched any moment.
I do not understand.
Brother, this palace
is made with lac.
Poisoning all of us first
and then torching this place
were all part of a scheme!
That way, everyone would think
that we died in an accident.
But... - This is not the time
to talk, brother Bheem.
We must first catch
that Purochan!
And then we will
take him to Hastinapur.
Let's go.
Let's go, mother.
Let's go.
Never did I imagine
that brother Duryodhan
would try to kill us!
Couldn't you imagine
such a thing, Sahadev?
Then your power of imagination
is very weak!
Did you forget?
He had poisoned me.
But we were children back then.
Children do many things
without thinking straight.
How could he do it now?
- I will crush Duryodhan's head
brother Yudhishthir!
I have heard that
when death approaches
a deer makes its way
to a lion's den on its own.
I think, Duryodhan's doom
is calling out to him.
Taste this 'kheer',
brother Bheem.
You 5 brothers will touch
the feet of us 100 brothers.
Right now!
And forever after.
Mother, what kind
of a place is this?
No one seems happy
upon our arrival here.
It seems like
we are refugees here
and have no right
to this place.
Certainly.
This is a big kingdom.
You can ask for food
from anyone.
That is what your mendicant of
a father must have taught you.
Yudhishthir
the blood of which dynasty
runs through your veins?
From whom did your
characterless mother
conceive you?
Very soon
the reason of your worry
will come to an end,
brother Bheem.
You 5 brothers will touch
the feet of us 100 brothers.
Right now!
- It seems like...
And forever after.
-...we are refugees here...
Mother, what kind
of a place is this?
Certainly.
This is a big kingdom.
You can ask for food
from anyone.
That is what your mendicant of
a father must have taught you.
Very soon,
the reason of your worry
will come to an end,
brother Bheem.
Brother Bheem is correct,
brother Yudhishthir.
If we do not draw
our weapons even now
we will be termed
as cowards and weaklings.
Just give me the order,
brother Yudhishthir!
I await it!
Do not give them any order,
Yudhishthir.
What are you saying, mother?
How can we calm down?
Duryodhan has schemed
to burn us alive.
He schemed to burn you,
our mother!
If that is the case, sons
then all of us
shall burn to ashes here.
They conspired to kill my sons!
Such hatred...
Such animosity harbours in them!
No, sons.
Going to Hastinapur now
is not an option any longer.
Going to Hastinapur now
is not an option any longer.
The gates of that kingdom
are closed for us now.
What are you saying, mother?
Why should we not go there?
It is our home.
A home is made up
of a family, son.
A place filled with enemies
is not a home
but a camp in a war.
Death looms in such a place.
Anger pervades such a place.
Doubt infests
such a place.
It feels like hell
in such a place, son.
We cannot live
in a place like that.
But, mother, brother Yudhishthir
is the Crown Prince
and he has the right
to the throne.
We have no greed for polity.
We do not want any throne!
Your father had
renounced polity himself
and resided in a forest.
Did you forget that?
You were even born
in a forest.
It was a forest
where sages would meditate.
There was no misery.
We did not go to Hastinapur
asking for our rights.
We had gone there
asking for a family.
We had gone there seeking the
love and respect of that family.
If we do not have
any right to their love
then what is the point
of the right to the throne?
Yudhishthir
if Duryodhan wants polity
then let go of it, son.
But, mother,
what about justice?
Duryodhan tried
to kill you, mother!
Right now, my blood is boiling
like an erupting volcano!
I would be a disgrace if I
do not punish Duryodhan!
What punishment will you
give Duryodhan?
When Bheem was poisoned
what punishment was
given to Duryodhan?
King Dhritarashtra has
forgotten at the moment
that a King is the father
of all his subjects.
Right now, he is just a father
of his 100 sons.
Duryodhan will receive
no punishment, Arjun.
He will receive no punishment.
The one to be punished
will be me.
I will be punished, son.
All of you are capable.
You can revolt
against Hastinapur.
But if that happens
then my husband's soul
will grieve in heaven.
And if you do not revolt
against Hastinapur
then we will have to live
with such conspiracies.
Day and night
I will be plagued with doubts.
The only property I have with me
are the five sons of mine.
Among the five of you
the mere possibility of
any of you dying will be like
going through hell to me.
Do you wish to see me
face the atrocities of hell
in every moment
of the rest of my life?
And son
Duryodhan...
Duryodhan needs to succeed
just once, son.
Just once.
We will never let him
succeed, mother!
Never!
- They will succeed!
They certainly will!
If you stay there, you will
lose your peace of mind!
Duryodhan will compel you
to conspire against him.
He will extinguish
your righteousness!
In other words, you will
either lose your life or morals.
But, I
will lose in both the cases.
Now, you decide, sons
if the news of all of you dying
will award me misery for life
or righteousness dying within
you will award me the same.
What kind of a punishment
have all of you chosen for me?
Answer me.
Answer me!
When your tears
are that of joy, mother
it is like a plunge
into the Holy Ganges to us.
But when they are
that of sorrow
it is like a plunge
into the fire to us, mother.
Mother, this is
such a big world.
Why would we choose a place
where our mother
would neither be in peace
nor be contented?
Why would we
do such a thing, mother?
Why would we?
If it is your order
then we shall certainly
not return to Hastinapur.
No one will even know
that we are alive.
Mother.
I'm still hungry.
Uh!
But, hadn't I given you
laddoos'?
Arjun, Nakul and Sahadev
ate all those 'laddoos'.
Did they eat all the 'laddoos'?
Not all, but most of them.
They ate four of those
laddoos'.
Wait.
I had kept this 'laddoo
for Madhavi.
Here. You may have this 'laddoo
as well.
I don't know why, mother.
But when you feed me
with your hands
I am satiated instantly.
Because I'm content at heart and
it passes over to your stomach.
And my biggest contentment lies
in feeding all five of my sons
with my own hands.
Come on. You all better come in
and have your lunch too.
Else, his contentment lasts
only for a few moments. Come.
Mother!
If I marry your father,
I shall only bear misfortune.
Your son shall be
your successor as the king.
But what shall be the fate
of my sons?
King Shantanu may have just
one of these two pleasures.
The pleasure of living in
the royal palace with his son.
Or the pleasure of living with
his wife in this humble home.
No, mother.
My father shall have
both these pleasures
at once.
I, the son of Ganga,
swear upon
the sanctity of my mother.
I shall spend my life
not as a king
but as a servant
of Hastinapur.
I will not have a family
of my won.
I swear to a life of celibacy.
On these banks of yours,
your son had taken an oath.
If only you had
stopped him then.
If you had stopped him then
so many lives wouldn't
have been lost.
Why didn't you stop him?
Why?
Every day, hundreds of humans
come to my banks, Satyavati.
They take various oaths
and make many promises.
If I keep stopping everyone
how will nature work, Satyavati?
It isn't my duty
to hinder one's oaths.
But Bheeshma is your son,
0' Bhagirathi.*
*One of the two headstreams of the Ganges.
For twenty five years you have
imparted him with morals.
You made him capable
of being a king.
But when he renounced royalty,
did it not pierce your heart?
Who isn't my son.
Every human who visits my banks
is my son.
And I always impart sanctity
and morals to everyone.
Therefore, isn't Bheeshma
significant to you?
He is...
Bheeshma is significant.
But that significance
lies in his heart.
Not in how I perceive him.
Satyavati.
The bad state that Hastinapur
and the Kuru clan is in today
you are the one solely
responsible for it.
Because your vision has the gift
of foresight, nof mine.
I am a mere moral.
I am not immortal as yourself.
Every moment, the fear of death
torments the human heart.
That is why he seeks protection.
I, too, was just seeking
protection.
So, did you find protection?
What did you get?
A lifetime of struggle?
And humiliation at this old age?
Curses and distrust
of millions of subjects?
To add sugar or salt to an urn
of water, is your decision.
But once you take a decision it
cannot be reverted, Satyavati.
I know, 0' Bhagirathi.
It was my fault indeed.
But, I didn't possess the power
of foresight then.
And a human's life is a
consequence of his deference.
I know.
It was my fault.
But now...
Now I must strengthen the future
of the Kuru dynasty
and the Kuru empire.
Please suggest a way
to do it, Ganga.
Please, show me the path.
You had made the first decision
on your own.
You hadn't sought anyone's
advice.
Now it's time to take
the second decision.
You have to decide by yourself,
Satyavati.
Everyone wants to make decisions
about today, for a bright future
To have a happy and safe future.
To take such decisions today is
what everyone attempts to do.
Consider your life for example.
Aren't most of your decisions
backed by thoughts for future?
And why shouldn't they be?
Everyone has the right to make
their life simple and happy.
But no one knows the future.
It can only be imagined.
So we make all crucial
decisions of life
based on imagination.
Could there be a third possible
way to reach a decision?
Think about it.
The basis of all pleasures
is a sense of duty.
And the sense of duty resides
within the human heart.
So before coming to any decision
do ask your heart the question
whether this decision
is result of selfishness
or out of your sense of duty?
Isn't it reasonable?
So, won't thinking about your
duty instead of the future
make the future
far more joyous?
Think for yourself.
Salutations, Queen Mother!
Salutations, Queen Mother!
Bless you, son!
Vidur.
Arrange for travel.
I need to leave at dawn's break.
Are you leaving for somewhere?
To fulfill my duties, Bheeshma.
I should have done it years ago.
But then, my selfishness
hindered me from
being aware of my duties.
Fortunately, it didn't hinder me
my entire life.
But now, I must bring about
a change of circumstances.
What do you mean, Queen Mother?
Vidur.
It was my duty to pay
a wise son as yourself
the respect you truly deserve.
But I never did so.
I always perceived your advice
as inappropriate.
But today...
Today I have realized
my mistake, Vidur.
Hence I...
I am here to take you along,
on my journey.
The two of us shall go to Pandu.
I shall reason with him...
Convince him.
I shall remind him
of his duties.
And at any cost,
I shall bring Pandu back
to manage the throne
of Hastinapur.
Welcome, Your Highness.
What ritual have you organized,
elder brother?
It is to take a pledge,
dear Gandhari.
Have a seat.
- No, brother.
Until I don't know the outcome
of this ritual
I shall not participate
in the ritual.
Dear Gandhari.
Your elder brother's heart
wishes for nothing but joy
for you and your family.
Don't you trust your brother?
My family doesn't end at just
my husband and my children.
The descendants of
king Shantanu are my family.
Uh!
Then it is a dispute between you
and your spouse.
If instead of Duryodhan,
one of Pandu's sons gets
the throne of Hastinapur
and that's acceptable to you
then you may discuss the matter
with your husband.
Why would that happen, Shakuni?
My successor can be none other
than my son, Duryodhan.
What do you have to say,
Gandhari?
I have faith in Grandsire.
I have faith in Queen Mother
and Vidur as well.
They will see to it that
no injustice is done.
Once, a pond was drying up.
The frogs there had to go
to another pond.
A stork said...
Trust me. I shall take
you to the other pond'.
Sit within my beak'.
Did you understand anything,
dear Gandhari?
Those frogs who trusted the
stork didn't reach the pond.
They reached the stork's
intestines instead.
Today, after fifteen years
why did Queen Mother
remember Pandu all of a sudden?
Did you ever give it a thought,
Your Highness?
Indeed!
I have been thinking of the same
since many days now, Shakuni.
If out of affection,
Queen Mother indeed embarked
upon this journey, why did
she take Vidur along?
She has definitely gone there
to help King Pandu
complete his penance,
Your Highness.
Come, Your Highness.
Have a seat.
Let us take a pledge.
What oath do you want us
to take, elder brother?
To break the Kuru dynasty
into pieces?
No, sister.
Why would I want your clan
to be divided?
Why would I violate
His Highness's trust?
All I want is that
His Highness's offspring
be called 'Kaurav'.
The 'Pandavas' should
not be included.
Before the return of
Queen Mother and the minister
Prince Duryodhan should
be declared
the crown prince of Hastinapur.
If my words seem appropriate
then have a seat.
How far can this arrow be shot,
father?
It can be shot all the way
out of this forest.
I can throw it that far
with my hands.
What is the need of a bow
for that?
It's not about throwing it,
brother Bheem.
It's a matter of piercing
the target.
At how far can a target be shot,
father?
The strength of a bow
depends on a man.
It is not the other way around,
son.
A weapon is only as handy
as the wielder's inner strength.
Just as a skill is only as
beneficial as one's will power.
I do not understand, father.
What is will power?
When the wind blows at a high
speed, it can uproot trees.
The tree that get uprooted,
becomes firewood.
But the tree that stands firm,
blooms new leaves and flowers
after a certain time.
And that is termed as
the will power of the tree.
Even when the odds are
against him
a human should not abandon
his duties, son.
And what is inner strength?
When pests and termites
from beneath the ground
start biting and devouring
a tree, some trees die.
But there are some trees,
that the pests cannot devour.
That is the tree's
inner strength.
When evil afflicts
the human heart
and tries to consume it
from within
then he should not give in
to the affliction within.
That means, will power protects
against unfavourable
circumstances outside.
And against the inner conflicts,
inner strength protects us.
Brilliant, my son.
I am proud of you.
Some day you shall be the most
deserving king of Hastinapur.
Queen Mother.
Arrangements for your meals
and rest have been made here.
And your seat has been arranged
upon that river bank.
I have no need for rest, Vidur.
But the soldiers and
the horsemen need to rest.
For many years
I have lived
in the comfort of the palace.
But not even for a single moment
did I feel rested at all.
Maybe, as my mind keeps working,
my body gets tired too.
But today...
Today, it is as if
this single right decision
erased all traces of tiredness
and pain within my body.
You had enthroned King Pandu
even before this, Queen Mother.
But it was a twist of fate...
- No, Vidur!
It isn't the fault of fate.
If my decisions were
inappropriate
I could have forgiven myself.
But the reasons behind
my decisions
were always inappropriate.
There was affection
within my mind.
But I had restrained that
affection out of selfishness.
Do you see that river, Vidur?
It flows between the banks...
But its water...
But its water goes underground
and reaches far, to those
trees within that forest.
A Queen Mother's life is
somewhat similar, Vidur.
She lives with her family.
But if her affection and respect
does not reach across the nation
then her life is futile.
Her reign is incompetent.
So, will brother Pandu heed
your words, Queen Mother?
Will he abandon his penance?
He will heed.
Pandu will surely heed my words.
I shall convince him.
This nature,
the flowers bloomed in spring
these leaves, the bark of trees,
the excitement of the birds...
I shall show him all of it.
I shall tell him
that if we wish such a spring to
bloom within our subjects' lives
he must give up his oath.
And Vidur...
In the spring, even Lord Shiva's
penance was broken for a moment.
Pandu's penance shall be
surely broken too.
Mother!
Mother!
Sahadev!
What happened, son?
I don't know why, mother.
But my heart is quivering.
Surely some mishap has occurred
with father.
I am nothing.
But I am also everything.
This has happened in every age
and will happen in future,
as well.
When you reflect on your own being.
You will find that your own self is 
also connected to me.
And then, like me,
you'll find that you are also within the avatar
of the Almighty.
But to reach that stage,
it is important for you to 
wholly submit to me.
What do you mean with 
submit', Madhav?
It is a state of mind
where one surrenders all one's desires.
Not making any expectations for oneself.
And not taking any oath
for anyone according to
what is requested from him.
In short, submitting yourself to someone,
willingly.
Your mind,
your thought, your knowledge,
your wish, your desire, your emotion,
and all that you have,
to someone.
That commitment is called submission.
A wife committed to her husband.
A soldier committed to his general.
A student committed to his teacher.
Isn't all these submissions the same?
Isn't all of them reaching God?
No, Arjuna.
When one committed to something
or someone,
it's according to its circumstances.
One that leaves no room for doubts
or questions.
Commitment to someone evil,
can make one to slander.
King of Anga, Karna, even when 
he knows what is right,
slanders Panchali in the 
game of dice.
A woman that has relations to five men
is no better than a harlot.
And because of
King of Anga's committment 
to brother Duryodhana,
he will get punishment in this war.
Is that so?
No. But because of his loyalty
to an evil person.
That's why, Arjuna,
it is important to commit oneself 
to what is right.
That will make a human righteous.
Otherwise one is like a criminal that's 
bound with an iron chains.
Like a temple lamp bound by 
a brass chains.
Like a gold chains around our neck,
just as ornament.
Loyalty to a husband, 
loyalty to a teacher,
loyalty to friends, they are but
some forms of loyalty.
But the true loyalty of all,
is your loyalty to God.
But is dedication to God
must be fulfilled with "sankhya yoga" 
or "karma yoga"?
Because of "sankhya yoga"
human knows that they are 
only souls.
And because of 'karma yoga
they can liberate themselves 
from the bind.
And that's because through dedication
human knows the real manifestation 
of the Almighty,
and knows about the Almighty.
A human is in the circle of life and death.
To reach bliss and knowledge,
a human dedicate itself to the Almighty,
and becomes the Almighty.
Just like water falls into a river,
and becomes the river itself.
So do you mean,
that this human body has 
no value, Madhav?
It surely has value, Arjuna.
A human body is a medium
for human to meet the Almighty.
Between death and reincarnation,
with soul's knowledge is still active,
with experience, thoughts,
and learnings from the previous life,
the soul becomes part of a new body.
The soul growth and its commitment,
it only happens when it becomes part of 
a human body.
But, Madhav, by killing people that 
are present here,
do we not destroy their 
chance of liberation?
Your enemies have gone past the limits 
of righteousness.
Evil had become their second nature.
Liberation for them is not possible.
Sinners only given chance
to reform to a certain time.
I had given Sishupala 99 offences,
but it becomes necessary to punish him,
for his 100th offence.
If we let sinners do evils,
they will do more and more.
Righteousness is stopping them 
committing sins.
These souls will not meet their ends,
but leave their bodies that had been 
corrupted with evils.
And become part of a new human body.
And there are more opportunities to reform 
in their new bodies.
If you fight this war with this logic,
it would be justifed.
A human body, to a human, is its wealth.
As bhakti,* as dignity.
*Dedication.
Those who tread the path of truth,
will purify their bodies.
And, through that path,
they will meet their souls.
This is the relation between 'kshetra'* and 'kshetragna'.*
*Field, area, tract of land. **The fielder.
I don't understand, Madhav.
When one knows,
that one's body is like this dirt,
meaning, only a 'kshetra', a place.
And one who's aware of a land,
and standing on top of it is 'kshetragna'.
Then through his body,
one can measure one's progress.
A soul in the body balancing 
the 3 righteousness,
annihilates darkness,
and opening path for righteousness.
And with dedication to God,
it becomes one with the Almighty.
But the worshipper
is devoting but not dedicating?
No, Arjuna.
That is the first step to dedication.
In reality, dedication is not a duty.
It is a meditated state of mind.
It is important for human 
to purify its soul.
Through prayers, repentaces,
yogna', ritual,
yoga' dan self learnings.
And remain devoted to the Almighty.
Devoting all his actions,
all moments,
each breath,
to the Almighty.
If dedication is only a state of mind,
then what use is prayers, repentances,
and all of these others?
They are only means to 
cleanse your self.
Cause it will be soiled again.
Human mind needs
to be repeatedly reminded of the Almighty.
That's why it is important
to pray, repent, self development, 
and others.
One needs to remind oneself, 
all the time,
that one's life is to serve the Almighty.
It's not important to know which river,
what's important is that you dive in it.
There's only one dedication in 'bhakti yoga',
that by surrendering one's life 
to the Almighty,
one will keep one's dedication 
to the Almighty,
and one will do good deeds in one's lives.
What is righteousness and kindness, Madhav?
Violence without reason or necessity, 
is not right, Arjuna.
In reality, nonviolence is a supreme decision.
And along with it, truth,
refrain from anger, sacrifice,
peace of mind, refrain from mocking,
generous,
actions without expecting rewards,
greatness, compassion, patience,
do not indulge in self praise, not egoistic,
all these qualities is called
the cardinal possession.
Only with help from these, a human becomes 
my true worshiper.
Fullfill their duties in life.
Establish truth.
And live without attachment to the fruit 
of his deeds.
I will certainly,
grant happiness in his life,
and absorb him into my self 
after his death.
What is your true form, Madhav?
Through 'sankya yoga',
I know if my soul (atma),
is eternal.
And that it is in this temporal body only 
for a certain time.
I know how, through actions without 
expecting rewards,
sacrificing the desire for rewards,
and fullfill one's duties,
one attains peace of mind and 
happiness in life.
Through spiritual discipline,
I know how important is 
submittance to you.
But, Madhav, you say
that to the Almighty
no humans are standing here, 
or all place,
but
I still see humans standing here.
All humans, Madhav.
I want to have a glimpse of your 
true being, Madhav.
Your power, glory, knowledge,
in all majesty,
divine form. 
I want to see it, Madhav.
Display your devastating being 
to me, Madhav,
to quash all doubts in my heart.
Show your self, Madhav.
Behold, Arjuna.
Through the knowledge of divinity (sankya yoga), one attains discipline in altruistic deeds.
Through that discipline (karma yoga), 
one attains spirituality.
And through spirituality (bhakti yoga), 
one attains knowledge.
Behold that my 'murti'* form
*An image in which the Divine Spirit is expressed ('murta').
is the knowldge of the truth, Arjuna.
This is the supreme knowledge.
This form is the base of all 
knowledge and sciences.
This knowledge bestows salvation.
Even the gods can't see this form easily.
This form I manifested for you, Arjuna.
I reside in each and every particle 
of this universe.
And earth, sun, moon,
galaxy, and constellations reside in me.
I did not get the opportunity
to meet brother Arjun again.
And I also could not seek
the blessings of Mother Kunti.
Rukmini, look behind you.
What do you see?
Our footprints, My Lord.
Look.
Those prints got washed away
by the waves, Rukmini.
Footprints not being visible
does not mean
that the ones who made them
are also not present.
Does this mean
the Pandavas are alive?
I do not know
but if they are alive
then I need to meet them soon.
But why do you not answer me
whether they are alive or not?
A definite answer?
Its definite answer is, Rukmini
that it is time for
the entire society to change.
Look from Magadha to Matsya
and from Kuru to Vidarbha.
Subjects...
Subjects toil in the fields.
They enter the mines to dig out
iron, gold and precious gems.
They break down rocks
to construct buildings.
In other words, subjects yield
the entire wealth.
But what do they get in return?
They get hunger, poverty
and injustice in return.
And the Kings, Rulers
and Emperors get wealthier.
Have you ever seen a King who is
concerned for his subjects?
A King who is concerned
for their happiness.
A King who is concerned
for their welfare.
No, correct?
And this is what God
calls unrighteousness.
When such unrighteousness
gets out of hand
in order to salvage the world,
God gives birth to people
who have
a righteous heart.
Until things change
until subjects of a kingdom
gain true happiness
those great men sent by God
do not die, Rukmini.
I have complete faith
that they are alive.
And I shall meet them very soon
in Panchal.
Why in Panchal?
We shall meet in Panchal,
Rukmini
because there in the mud
of unrighteousness
the lotus of righteousness
is about to be born.
Such a power is about
to be born there
that will change the future
of the entire Aryan region.
And I have to go there
to protect this power.
From who?
From the one who is going
to give birth to that power.
In other words
from the King of Panchal,
Drupad.
Panchal
- the City of Kampilya.
W-Water...
With whose permission are you
giving him water, Shikhandini?
If they do not get water,
they will die.
And we will commit the sin
of killing a sage, father.
Fool!
They are fated to die.
He is not a sage
but a charlatan!
All of them are charlatans!
If the water of a river
is unfit for drinking
it is best for that river
to dry up.
If your rigourous meditation
cannot give me a son
then why
should I allow you to live?
But you are destined
to have a daughter,
Your Highness.
You shall not have a son.
Stop, King Drupad.
King Drupad,
by killing these sages
you are paving your way to hell.
We shall fulfill your wish.
The great sages Yaja
and Upayaja,*
*Two sage brothers that lived on the banks of the Ganga.
when I had approached you
you had no intention of
performing a 'yajna' for me.
Are you scared now
that you will die at my hands?
We do not fear for our lives
but for that of
thousands of sages.
So, in order to save the lives
of a handful of sages
you are going to perform
a charade of a 'yajna?
Or in order to
bless me with a son
you wish to perform the 'yajna
great sage Yaja?
Tell me the truth.
You shall indeed have a son
from the 'yajna.
But King Drupad
you are destined
to have a daughter.
And when you
accept your daughter
only then will you get your son
from the Gods.
And when you
accept your daughter
only then will you get your son
from the Gods.
- Daughter!
I have got nothing
to do with a daughter!
She cannot defend
the honour of her father!
She cannot take revenge
for the insult he faced!
This Shikhandini...
At the time of her birth,
everyone had said
that Bhishma will die
at her hands!
He had insulted my father!
She was supposed to
take revenge for that!
With that hope in his heart
my father passed away!
But she did nothing.
In order to have a son
if I need to accept a daughter
then so be it!
She can stay in a corner
of my palace!
But I
want a son.
Your words reflect ignorance,
Your Highness.
In this world
it is the greatest honour
to have a daughter.
Do not forget that he had
given birth only to daughters
yet we call Daksh* as Prajapati.**
*"Competent", a great king, he had 89 daughters from his wife Prasuti and another 116 from his wife Panchajani (Virini).
**"Lord of creatures".
It was through his daughters
that life sprang in all spheres.
King Drupad
understand this truth real well.
The maiden born from the 'yajna
will fulfill
all your hopes and desires.
She will gain fame
in the entire Aryan region
for the re-establishment
of righteousness.
That maiden
will change
the course of history
and will mould
the future.
You have brought us
our meal, Arjun.
Come on.
We'll finish all this later.
Duryodhan may snatch
a palace from me
but not my teeth and stomach.
No matter how hard
he tries to cause me pain
but as long as I can eat
nothing can pain me.
Mother
do serve us our meal.
Do begin.
Stop, mother.
Looking at this meal
has reminded me of something.
When we were dining
for the first time in Hastinapur
grandsire had told us
to eat without folding our arms.
Can you show us how to do so?
Without folding the arm?
Mother
as long as we are together
you will not shed tears.
As long as we are together
neither do we
need to fold our arms
nor bow our heads before anyone.
But all of us must take turns
to feed brother Bheem.
I cannot feed him every day.
How dare you, Vidur?!
Divide the Kuru Kingdom!
How could you even
suggest such a thing?!
Did the mere thought of this
not split your head in two?!
My heart has been split, uncle.
Please pardon me, uncle!
But in a situation like this
this is the only solution
I could think of.
Quit with your rambling, Vidur!
This is not a solution
but a mockery!
A mockery of our ancestors!
Our ancestors
have struggled a lot
and have sacrificed many things
to make our Kuru Kingdom
the most powerful one
in the entire world!
Just look at our ancestors.
They have built
this kingdom of ours.
My revered father Shantanu
made this kingdom powerful.
He augmented the boundaries
of this kingdom
and you wish
to break it, Vidur?!
But brother Yudhishthir
if uncle Vidur has suggested
the kingdom to be divided
then he must have
put some thought into it.
Yes, brother Yudhishthir.
He thought of our happiness.
To keep internal conflicts
from rising in the Kuru kingdom
he thought of this solution.
But how can the division
of our motherland
ever be accepted by us?
But the Great Sage Vyas had said
that we must ask for our rights.
Not for us but the subjects
of our kingdom.
How can asking for one's rights
equate to dividing
the kingdom, Bheem?
My body shall be divided first.
Only then will the kingdom
get divided.
Uncle
oil and water
and never kept
in the same container.
They can never mix.
Then neither of them
is fit for any use.
Uncle
if we wish to make happiness
return to Hastinapur
then dividing the kingdom
is the sole solution.
Impossible!
I have the right to the
entire kingdom, father! Me!
This is my kingdom.
This is my kingdom!
Why should I give half of it
to the sons of Pandu, father?!
No one can even dare to think
of dividing this kingdom.
Had you told me before, son
that you had seen the sons
of Pandu alive in Kampilya
then... - Then what would
you have done, father?
Grandsire and the Minister
have always bound you
in the name of righteousness.
And you become weak before them
every single time.
That is why,
after declaring
brother Duryodhan
as King we were going
to tell you about it.
Father
making you resort to asceticism
was never my intention.
Grandsire and the Minister
are here to serve you.
They can never act
as your master.
And whenever
it concerns my rights
they always render
you weak, father.
Brother Duryodhan
is correct, father.
If you do not realize
the importance of your
status and position
then why would anyone else?
You must use your might to prove
that your decision is ultimate.
Grandsire will be
deeply anguished.
The soul of our father will be
deeply anguished, Bheem.
But brother Yudhishthir
Madhav had said that we
should have our kingdom.
Would refuting his advice
be correct?
Subjects can also be served
without gaining polity.
No, Arjun.
Just to gain hold of polity
we cannot have
the kingdom divided.
I shall approach His Highness
and step down
as the Crown Prince.
Do not forget that
His Highness is mighty
but he is so only because
of Bhishma and the Minister.
Both of them
the Minister and Bhishma
are the armour and weapons
of His Highness.
Till the time the shell
keeps a tortoise covered
it does not know defeat.
However, if the tortoise
falls to the ground shell first
it begins to squirm!
You seem to be forgetting the
might of us 100 brothers, uncle!
The army of Gandhar,
the army of Ashwatthama
and that of King Karna of Anga...
When he is backed
by these entities
why would father
need to be afraid?!
You should demonstrate
your might, father!
What do I do now,
my sons?
What do I do?!
They had taken to arms
in the court, father.
It was an insult to you.
We have a splendid opportunity
to defeat Yudhishthir.
You know quite well, father
that a criminal or culprit
has no right to be
the Crown Prince.
What do you mean?
Just think about
my suggestion, uncle.
Brother Dhritarashtra
too is a righteous man
and I am certain of it.
But if amber is covered
with ashes
then it does not give off light.
At the moment,
brother Dhritarashtra
is surrounded by Duryodhan
and the King of Gandhar.
Hence, he is unable
to think righteously.
I do not agree with you, Vidur.
I have firm faith
that Dhritarashtra
will heed my advice.
I shall remind him of his duties
towards the kingdom.
Great Bhishma
I bring an exceedingly
important news.
His Highness has ordered
the Pandavas
to be taken into custody.
Pardon us, Crown Prince
but His Highness has ordered
to take all of you into custody.
Greetings, great Bhishma.
Where is His Highness?
He is performing
a 'yajna,' sire.
He has given the order
to not permit anyone inside.
Tell him Bhishma
has come to meet him.
I have something important
to discuss with him.
When one's own family
is in a crisis
one cannot earn merit
by performing a 'yajna.
Go on!
- As you say, sire.
Soldier!
Is this the rope
you have to bind me?!
You cannot be bound even by
iron shackles, Prince Vrikodar
but what can I do?
I am bound by orders.
Even I am bound by them!
An order is far stronger
than even lightning!
Otherwise there is no prison
on this planet
which can imprison
my brothers and me!
Calm down, Bheem.
Do not fret.
If the King has
taken us into custody
then we shall indeed
spend our lives in prison.
If the King has
taken us into custody
then we shall indeed
spend our lives in prison.
Following a King's order
and honouring justice...
If Princes do not abide by them
then how can the subjects
of a kingdom?
Panchali
do ask for this rope
from aunt Gandhari.
It is very strong.
Just look.
Hey!
It broke.
Soldier!
Bring another rope.
- Indeed.
Bring about ten ropes which are
used to bind an elephant.
And do get an order
from the Minister
preventing brother from breaking
the rope while having 'laddoos.
How will you solve
this situation, My Lord?
There is only one solution,
Panchali.
We can apologize
to His Highness.
Even mother will
suggest the same.
What do you suggest,
Panchali?
I do not covet any land,
My Lord.
If I have to serve all of you
even in the woods
then I am ready to do so.
But...
But what, Panchali?
Panchali
do you think, we should
not apologize to the King?
Yes, My Lord.
If you are guilty
then face the punishment.
But if not, then protest
against this injustice.
What is the point
in apologizing?
Does apologizing have
no value, Panchali?
You are wise enough, My Lord.
How can I dispense
advice to you?
Nevertheless
in my opinion
if one apologizes to someone
inferior to him
then it is called valour.
But if someone
is stronger than you
then apologizing to him
is called cowardice.
You are correct,
Panchali.
Do not worry.
We will not apologize.
Let's go, soldier.
Panchali
if we will be imprisoned
then Hastinapur may not be
safe for you.
You should get ready
to leave for Kampilya.
Maybe this is the end
of your journey with us.
Pardon me,
great Bhishma!
His Highness has said that
until the 'yajna' is complete
he will not see anyone.
Eldest brother!
The guards will spot us
if we go that way.
We must take a different path.
This way!
Brother!
There is no other way, Arjun!
Those cowards have
set it ablaze on all sides.
Arjun! You must use
the 'Varunastra'!
The 'Varunastra'...
No!
If the fire is doused, everyone
will know that we are alive.
The walls are starting to melt,
eldest brother!
They say that Goddess Saraswati
could not flow on this earth
holding a divine fire
in her hands.
Therefore, she started
flowing under the ground.
If you bathe,
recounting this tale
you will be blessed, Arjun!
Eldest brother!
Lord Krishna had narrated to me,
the tale of Goddess Saraswati.
When it became impossible
for the river
to flow over the ground, she
began flowing under the ground.
It was surely an advice
meant for this day.
Even we must find a way
through the ground.
Excellent suggestion!
This way!
Make haste!
Mother!
- Mother!
Bheem!
Brother Bheem!
Brother Bheem!
Mother!
Arjun!
Eldest brother! Take mother
away to a safe place.
No, Yudhisthir! I...
I won't leave without Arjun.
We will wait for you, Arjun!
We cannot go without you!
Mother's safety is more crucial,
brother Bheem!
Arjun!
Take mother away from here!
Make haste, brother Bheem!
Make haste,
the flames are rising!
No, Arjun!
Eldest brother!
Leave this place!
Take mother to a safe place.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Bheem! Mother!
Mother, have patience!
Arjun must be on his way.
Yudhisthir, Arjun...
Nakul.
Yudhisthir... Take all your
brothers out here and I...
I shall wait for Arjun.
- No!
Brother, we won't leave
without mother.
Sahadev!
- We will all wait, mother!
We lived together.
And we will be together
in death too.
Before any flame
even touches mother
it will have to scorch us first.
Arjun!
Arjun!
My dear Arjun!
Uncle!
Why did His Highness
imprison my sons, uncle?
What... What crime
have they committed?
I have come here
to find out exactly that.
Do hurry, uncle.
I...
I am not dispensing
advice to you.
If an onion falls into the milk
and is not taken out soon
then the entire milk
reeks of onion.
Same is the case with the
reputation of human beings.
If...
If this news spreads across
the Aryan region then...
Then what will happen
to the reputation of my sons?
Dhritarashtra!
A 'yajna' is performed
to earn merit
and not to wash away one's sins.
One needs to bathe in the Ganges
to wash away one's sins.
This 'yajna' will not
wash away your sins!
Great Bhishma
Why such anger?!
Ask your husband,
Gandhari!
He has imprisoned the Pandavas!
People who dare to take
to arms in the court
get punished, uncle.
You had told me that the culprit
who does not get punished
becomes the source of motivation
to other culprits.
Yes, I did say that.
That is the exact reason
why I cannot let you commit
this crime too, Dhritarashtra!
You cannot imprison
the Pandavas!
Release them!
King Dhritarashtra
cannot be commanded
by you, grandsire.
Respect the polity
of His Highness.
Foolish Duryodhan!
This polity exists
only because of me!
And I can snatch it if I like!
I had told you before.
If I see Hastinapur
succumbing to unrighteousness
then I shall take to arms
against it
and that will not
break my oath either.
You may certainly give a minor
punishment to Arjun, My Lord
but what are you
punishing the rest for?
Release the Pandavas,
My Lord.
Your Highness
I think so too.
Be quiet, uncle!
No, grandsire.
The order of His Highness
cannot be taken back.
And neither will he do so.
Dhritarashtra!
So, is this your
ultimate decision?
Splendid.
Now, I shall take my decision.
Great Bhishma...
Great Bhishma!
Great Bhishma.
Great Bhishma!
That was utter foolishness!
Uncle, but you had said...
I had said so but now
I am going back on my words.
Politics is just like gambling,
my darlings.
If the dice defects
then one must also learn
to change one's tactics.
Do you wish to see Bhishma's
strength and majesty
beloved Duryodhan?
Just like the Almighty
the great Bhishma
can annihilate all your plans.
Do you wish to see this,
beloved Duryodhan?
Come with me.
Stop, soldiers!
The Pandavas will not
retaliate against you
because they are duty bound.
However, I shall
retaliate against you
because I am bound by my oath.
Either fight me
or release the Pandavas.
Grandsire, because of us
you cannot revolt against
the throne of Hastinapur.
We are not as valuable
as your oath.
Dear Yudhishthir
my oath has value
only because of you.
Soldiers
pick up your weapons!
Did you see that,
my darling?
If that old man
is not on your side
then you will be
left with no army.
Even if the Pandavas
leave Hastinapur
then some other King
of the Aryan region
will attack Hastinapur.
That old man's absence
will leave Hastinapur empty
just like Nandi's* absence would leave
Kailash** so.
*, ** An anthropomorphic deity who was one of Shivas two door-keepers of Kailash.
Do you understand,
my darling?
Tell His Highness
to apologize
to the great Bhishma.
Tell him to be prepared.
Uncle.
Minister
I have taken the decision
that if His Highness
does not declare
Yudhishthir King
then I shall not stay
in Hastinapur!
Grandsire
please calm down.
Your love and faith mean
more to us than any kingdom.
That is not adequate.
This kingdom has always
housed righteousness
and it will continue to do so.
Uncle
give me the opportunity
to look for another solution.
You need not look for another
solution, Minister Vidur.
His Highness expresses remorse
over his deed.
Prince Arjun
for the crime of taking
to arms in the court
His Highness has ordered
you and all my nephews
to fast for a day
as punishment.
Crown Prince
His Highness apologizes to you.
To all of you.
Will you not pardon
your uncle, Crown Prince?
We do not have the right to
pardon uncle, King of Gandhar.
He pardoned us
and we are glad to hear it.
You are very generous,
Crown Prince.
Your Excellency
by touching your feet,
His Highness
wishes to apologize to you.
If you come by his chamber
then he would be
grateful to you.
Go on.
I will be there.
Thank you,
Your Excellency.
Goodbye, Minister.
You were correct, Vidur.
Water and oil
can never be kept
in the same container.
I feel as though
the division of this kingdom
is the only way out.
Dividing this beloved land
of our ancestors
will leave neither you
nor us happy.
It would be better
if we leave Hastinapur.
Dear Yudhishthir
you may leave Hastinapur
but only as a King
and not a hermit.
Dear Yudhishthir
through the medium of Vidur,
mother Satyavati has ordered me
to declare you King.
I could not help you get
the entire Kuru kingdom
but
by helping you get half of it
I shall have some solace.
But brother Yudhishthir
has the right
to the entire kingdom,
grandsire.
If you tell him to
then uncle will have to declare
brother Yudhishthir the King.
Then why this division?
Dear Bheem
a person sitting in the shade
of a tree seems dark.
The shade of the tree
taints the complexion
of that person.
If you stay with the sons
of Dhritarashtra here
then your righteousness
will get tainted as well.
This is what I fear.
That is why
division is the sole way out.
We know what
righteousness is, grandsire.
But without your guidance
how will we know
what the desired action is?
Dear
I too shall come with you.
I had promised my father
that I shall protect
his throne my entire life.
And his throne is where
there is righteousness.
In other words
in Yudhishthir's kingdom.

to please the king.
You wished to please him?
Do you think competing against
the king will please him?
You are better at archery
than any 'Kshatriya'.
Upon knowing this, will it
please the king or anger him?
I have explained it to you
so many times.
The son of a charioteer
should behave like one.
Son, your skills won't
please the king
but your dedication towards
him will.
No, father.
Our king is not like that.
And look at the face
of the Queen.
She has such an
affectionate look.
Just like mother Radha.
Let me go, father!
No, Karna.
Karna, no.
Look at that, your Highness.
A group of people from
the forest are here.
They must have welcomed you so.
Long live King Pandu!
Long live King Pandu!
Long live King Pandu!
Four.
One, two, three, four.
One is bound to come across
obstacles, Sanjay
but the one who knows
how to overcome them
is the one who never loses.
But some obstacles
cannot be overcome, Shakuni.
Those are like shackles of fate.
True, your Highness.
You are absolutely correct.
Some obstacles are like
shackles of fate.
Sanjay, tell me.
How will you overcome
the obstacle you face?
If the dice roll...
Yes. If I score six points,
I can overcome this obstacle.
In other words, the dice can
liberate you from the shackles.
You need to befriend
your dice, Sanjay.
Befriend them!
I am not talking about
a game of dice
but about life.
- Life!
Life!
I too am talking about life,
your Highness.
It is all in our heads.
We have memories.
Walks on two legs.
We see him around us
but we
mistake him a for a human being,
your Highness.
Who are you talking about,
Shakuni?
Prince Pandu
who has recently returned
after getting married.
To me, welcoming him is like
rolling the dice right.
Sister, why is
Gandhari not here?
Sukta said that
Dhritarashtra does not
want Gandhari
to welcome the new couple.
But the new bride must be
welcomed by Gandhari, sister.
Ambalika
even Gandhari was welcomed
by Kripacharya's wife.
It was so for there was
no married woman
in our family back then.
But if there is a married woman
in the family
and yet we make someone else
give the traditional welcome
wouldn't that be an ill omen,
Queen Mother?
I shall let no ill omen befall
my family, mother Ambalika.
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Greetings.
Greetings.
I welcome
the Queen of Hastinapur.
Sister-in-law
My wife wishes to seek
your blessings.
Do bless her.
What do I bless you with, Kunti?
A happy married life,
children
a long live and welfare...
You have already been
blessed with all this.
Bless her by saying that
her wishes will come true
and that she will
face no obstacles.
Recognize the pawns,
your Highness
and keep rolling the dice.
All the obstacles
will be eliminated.
You are correct,
mother Ambalika.
And blessings
get rid of obstacles.
Where is brother Dhritarashtra?
Is he still angry?
Kunti, all the daughters-in-law
of the family
install their family
deities in this temple.
Give the priest the idol
of your family deity
for the consecration
ritual of the idol.
Sister-in-law
I have been blessed by everyone
but
neither did I get the
blessings of brother-in-law
nor did I get to meet him.
In the journey from the kingdom
of Kunti to Hastinapur
my Lord was talking
only about his elder brother.
His valour, his generosity
his fondness towards my Lord...
He said
that if his elder brother
blesses me
I would not require blessings
even from the Almighty.
I do not know, sister-in-law
whether or not I have the right
to say this.
Please pardon me.
But, sister-in-law
what I heard in Kuntinagar
is making me a little restless.
Absence of a festoon
at the entrance of a house
is not a matter of concern,
sister-in-law.
But the presence of a single
thorn in the orchard of a house
is not good.
There is no thorn
in this orchard, Kunti.
Your brother-in-law
has a very big heart.
To say it cannot house
his brother and his wife in it
is out of the question.
If you have heard that there's
a conflict between them
then it is untrue.
Some conniver must have
started this rumour.
Your brother-in-law has
boundless love for Pandu.
If love and deceit
compete against each other
love always triumphs.
Deceit always triumphs,
your Highness. - Deceit!
A warrior engages in a battle,
Shakuni
and not in deceit.
Battle!
Battle.
Deceit is like a battle,
your Highness.
A battle of the mind.
Do not consider deceit
to be bad, your Highness.
The people who get hurt
because of our actions
call it deceit
and the ones who benefit from it
call it strategy, your Highness.
In this game of life
Prince Pandu rolled the
dice perfectly
and defeated us.
Even I harbour
nothing but hatred
towards King Pandu.
Hate.
But now, we must
keep our minds calm
control our anger
come up with a new game
and defeat Prince Pandu.
Attention!
King Pandu is
making his entrance!
Welcome, King Pandu.
Welcome.
Greetings.
- Greetings, Prince.
Savant, greetings.
Congratulations, your Highness.
Upon hearing that you
won the 'swayamvar
my brother-in-law told me
that his younger brother
can never lose.
Greetings, brother.
May you live long.
Kunti and I were waiting for you
to bless us, brother.
Brother-in-law could not make it
only because of me.
He kept saying that
you would have reached
but I insisted
on playing one final
round of the game.
Then he was free to go.
Even I have heard that you
love these dice dearly, Prince.
Love!
Love!
You may assume they are two
wives of mine, your Highness.
Two dutiful wives.
Brother...
Kunti wishes to come
here to seek your blessings.
If you allow me then
may I go and get her?
I-Indeed...
- No!
No, we should go and greet her.
It is the right of a new bride
that everyone goes to
her to welcome her.
Your Highness...
I request you
to allow brother-in-law
to bless her Highness
tomorrow morning.
Besides, he does not have
anything to gift her at present.
He must also
present her something.
Because the one to be blessed
is not only his daughter-in-law
but also
the Queen of Hastinapur.
Alright.
Tomorrow morning, we will
come here to seek
your blessings, brother.
Certainly.
Greetings, brother.
Saying that you will
certainly bless them
was good thinking
on your part, your Highness.
I think, my game of dice
is finally making
some sense to you.
While making a decision,
we always
deem the suggestion, advice,
aid and consultation of others
as our foundation.
And the foundation
of our future
depends upon our decisions
made in the present.
So, is our future the result
of someone else's advice
and someone else's suggestion?
Is our entire life the result
of someone else's intellect?
Have we ever thought about it?
Our experience tell us
that different people
give different advice
in the same situation.
A devotee in a temple
believes in charity
but a thief says
that given an opportunity
he would steal
the idol's ornaments.
A pious heart
dispenses righteous advice
and a depraved heart
dispenses unrighteous advice.
Accepting righteous advice
propels man towards happiness.
But accepting such advice
is possible only when one
is pious.
In other words, before accepting
someone's suggestion or advice
is fostering righteousness
within one's heart
not important?
Think about it.
If one lies to gain something
then it is deception.
But if one hides the truth
to escape from harm
then it is not deception,
Princess.
And till the time you have
this thread on your wrist
you will not say anything to
your husband about your past.
I will not base my life
on deception.
My Lord
should know the truth
about my past.
In the journey
from Kuntibhoj to Hastinapur
I could not muster the courage
to tell him about it.
We hardly had any privacy.
But today
the moment my Lord arrives
the first thing I will do
is tell him about my past.
My Lord, upon seeing
Karna's archery skills
were the King and Queen
not impressed?
Yes, they were impressed.
But when they
would have learned
that he is the
son of a charioteer
their amazement would have
turned to anger, Radha.
You are well aware, Radha
that people of our caste
can become only charioteers
and not become warriors.
But why, father?
You always tell me that
the best work
is always commended.
Do not argue with me, Karna.
When a person achieves
highest quality in his work
only then does he
garner respect.
But when a person
does someone else's work
he does not garner respect
but competition.
My Lord, the King will
see him as his competitor...
Is this what you are
trying to say?
And the King...
- Not the King.
The warriors of the kingdom
will see him as a rival.
Not only us, our entire
community will face their wrath.
I feel, the King will be pleased
and will give me a reward.
And father, you always say
that the person who protects
the best in a society
is a true king.
You are still
arguing with me, Karna!
I already said that this
concerns our family's safety!
It is the question of safety
of not only our family
but also of the entire society!
Yet you insist
on displaying your skills.
Alright.
You may do so.
Here is an arrow.
Let the entire world know
that a charioteer who
can defeat warriors
has been born in
in Hastinapur.
I am not concerned about
your mother and I.
We will brave it.
Pick up your bow and arrows.
Pick them up!
Karna...
I am going away
to another home to become
its fortune, father.
May fortune always reside
in this abode of yours.
I pray to the Almighty for this.
Bless you!
Bless you.
May you become the valour
and motivation of your husbands.
May you become the basis
of their righteousness.
Bless you, daughter!
I shall always be there
to protect you, Draupadi.
And I shall always pray for
your safety, Dhrishtadyumna.
Deeming the reverence
towards you my wealth
I am leaving this place, Govind.
Keep protecting and testing
my righteousness.
Certainly, dear.
I have firm faith in you.
Do remember
that a husband's love
reflects in his valour
and that of a wife
in her patience.
This also has another meaning.
In testing times,
a husband must be patient
and a wife must display valour.
Go on, dear.
Because of you,
the entire Kuru dynasty
will get cleansed and purified.
If you too would have
accompanied us to Hastinapur
then it would have been
wonderful, Vasudev.
My hands are tied, Yudhishthir.
I must return to Dwaraka.
I look forward
to meeting you, Madhav.
We shall meet soon, friend.
Very soon.
But do remember something.
Yato Dharma Tato Jaya.
Victory is
where righteousness prevails.
This is a difficult path
but it is my fate.
May I fulfill my vows
and that is all I pray for.
I am surrounded
by uncertainties
but I must remain
firm in my oath.
May it be successful
and this is what I pray for.
Greetings, Minister Vidur.
Greetings, Vasudev.
I seek your permission...
Vasudev
a maiden
got married to five men!
Five?
The Pandavas are not five
in number, Minister Vidur.
They are five forms
of the same power
like the five faced Panchamukhi* Hanuman.
*'Five-faced', a metaphorical representation of various traits or characters.
And them staying united
is in the best interest
of everyone.
But Vasudev...
- No.
There is no place for any doubt,
Minister Vidur.
The Pandavas
have the strength
to brave all challenges.
Granted that their life
will not be all that easy
but I can certainly say
that it shall indeed
be successful.
Be patient and follow
the righteous path
to safeguard the throne
of Hastinapur, Minister.
The Aryan region will experience
a great turmoil, Minister
and the throne of Hastinapur
will be at the centre.
Do you know how far you are
from the throne
from where you are standing?
51 steps.
Do you know how I know this?
Because ever since I was born,
my destination
has always been this throne.
The name of my son will be
Duryodhan!
My son!
My heir
will be invincible, mother!
Every first born son
is the heir to his father.
In order to inherit
his father's property
the son of a shepherd
need not wait to be anointed.
Father may have
honoured the throne
but to honour its greatness
is a right he does not have.
Then what is the meaning
of presiding over it, mother?
In order to honour
the greatness of the kingdom
many Kings have
given up their lives.
Then can you
not give up your kingdom,
father?
Get me anointed, father!
I cannot live
with this insult.
Today, this sword will
either behead this horse
or your son.
My Lord.
Do you know
what the distance between
you and the throne is, Gandhari?
51 steps, My Lord.
No.
You are
only seven steps away.
And...
And those seven steps
are called Seven Hells,
Gandhari.
While making one's way
to the throne
one experiences seven hells.
But today...
Today, I
saw the seventh hell, Gandhari
when my own son
told me to resort to asceticism.
My...
My own...
My own Duryodhan
told me so, Gandhari.
The fault must
certainly be mine, My Lord.
A mother imparts values
to her children.
And a father is his son's ideal.
So, is it the fault
of his values or his ideal?
I am unable to figure
it out, Gandhari.
You
can still refuse him, My Lord.
That is something
I cannot do, Gandhari.
That is something I cannot do.
In the entire Kuru dynasty,
till date
no son has ever revolted
against his father.
But Duryodhan's ambitions
have inflated so much
that he will break traditions
and revolt against his father
Gandhari.
He...
He will revolt.
He will revolt.
He will not revolt, My Lord.
I have firm faith
that he has
love and respect for us
within him.
Gandhari
people ask for the throne
for their sons
but I had asked for a son
for the throne from you.
Duryodhan is certainly my heir
but...
But he could
not become my son,
Gandhari.
He could not become
my son, Gandhari.
He...
He will certainly take to arms
against me, Gandhari.
He will certainly do so.
The poison of my ambitions
also runs through his veins.
The plants that grow
near the ocean
are also salty, Gandhari.
They too are salty.
My Duryodhan wants
me to anoint him.
I have taken a decision,
Gandhari.
Tomorrow
at dawn
I will anoint him, Gandhari.
I shall indeed do so.
Kripacharya
let the anointment ceremony
begin.
Pardon me, Your Highness
but I request you
to wait for the great Bhishma.
Taking such a big decision
in his absence
will be incorrect.
Sometimes, even the incorrect
becomes necessary, Kripacharya.
Do begin the ritual.
That...
That is an order.
As you say, Your Highness.
Stop!
Prince Uttar.
Would you like to be the chariot
rider for Pandu's son Arjun?
Pandu's son?
Are you Arjun himself?
Under this guise?
Capability is determined
neither by guise
nor by name.
Capability lies in the mind.
Steer the chariot, Prince Uttar.
Today, Arjun will fight,
not Brihannala!
Today, I must teach
prince Duryodhan
the laws of the battlefield.
This surely is
the reverberation of
Arjun's 'Gandiva' bow.
Yes, prince Duryodhan!
This indeed is Arjun.
Just by the reverberation
of his bow
seems to instill
terror in your heart.
How will you defend yourself
from the arrows fired
from this bow?
You were very eager
to face Arjun.
Arjun is here now.
Before commencing the battle
I convey my greetings
to Grandsire Bheeshma.
Live long and prosper!
I, Arjun, the son of Pandu
owing to the archery skills
taught by you
challenge you for battle!
Prince Duryodhan!
I have waited days and nights
to raise my bow against you!
Today, I shall teach you
the laws of the battlefield!
Arjun!
There is no need
for battle at all.
Because your exile
has rendered to be a failure.
It is your plan that has failed,
Prince Duryodhan!
Look towards the sun!
The duration of my exile
is complete!
Your exile has failed.
If you act immorally
I shall crush you!
Soldiers!
Attack!
Do you think flaunting your
archery before a mace fighter
makes you powerful, Arjun?
Just as a crow bothering
an elephant and flying away
you come across as
weak and evasive!
Fight with me.
Fight with me!
Prince Uttar, this is no more
your fight.
Now, Arjun's 'Gandiva
shall dispense justice!
Friend Karna.
Fire the celestial weapon!
Why are you blocking
my arrows, Grandsire?
Grandsire Bheeshma, does Arjun
still need your protection?
I do not wish to shatter this
barrier you conjured, Grandsire!
Please clear the way yourself!
Today is the time to
avenge our humiliation!
Grandsire Bheeshma!
Such partiality!
Just to protect Arjun
you are ceasing
an ongoing battle?
Grandsire, this is
national treason!
Do not intervene in this battle!
Let this battle commence!
Duryodhan, you fool!
I am being partial
for your sake!
Or else
Arjun shall obliterate you all!
If you so confident
about Arjun's capability
then get out of the way!
I do not need
anyone's protection!
I do need protection,
O' armoured one!
My heart does need protection.
Arjun, my lad.
My arms are so powerful today.
But my heart...
My heart cannot bear
another trauma.
Arjun, my lad.
Cease this battle for today.
Do not sabotage your Grandsire's
love and trust.
When the blood of
my own kin is shed
won't the heart of your
Grandsire cringe in woe?
Please spare my aged eyes
of this terrible sight.
I have the boon
of death at will.
Do not give me a reason
to crave for death, O' lad.
Do not say that, Grandsire.
If I become
the cause of your death
I shall experience damnation
all though my life.
The one whom I always
respectfully bow down to
how can I raise my arm
against that person?
So cease this battle today,
my lad.
Please respect your
Grandsire's word.
Today I abide by your order,
Grandsire.
But you must give me your word.
If in future
a situation for war
presents itself
you shall not stop me!
Promise me, Grandsire!
Arjun!
Now the situation for battle
shall never arise.
Because you shall dwell
in the forests
and we shall live in the city!
The chance for battle
has arisen, Prince Duryodhan!
When ought to foolishness
a deer lurks into a lion's cave
it faces death that very moment!
All the deer is left with
are a few moments of struggle!
You may struggle too,
Prince Duryodhan!
Soon, the five Pandavas
shall arrive to punish you
for humiliating a woman
guised as your death!
Come!
Slave Draupadi!
Sit on my lap!
Come!
The way, in the courtroom
of Indraprastha
disarmed us in front of
the entire Arya clan
the same way,
disrobe her in this courtroom.
Just wearing nuptial jewellery
does not make a woman pristine.
How could such a woman
be worthy of our clan
who bears a relationship
with five men at once?
Such women are harlots!
No, Panchali!
This isn't the time
to shed tears.
Only blood shall be shed now.
All those who humiliated you
shall bleed from their hearts.
Do you think I thirst for blood,
my love?
Why such a question, Panchali?
Time heals all wounds.
It is a common belief.
But even an exile of 13 years
could not heal the wounds
inflicted upon my honour.
That scene from
the filled courtroom
still makes my soul
writhe in agony.
Now I just yearn for war
day and night.
No, Panchali.
In all these 13 years
your heart doesn't crave
solely for vengeance.
It craves for dispensing
of justice.
The determination
to cleanse the society
grows firmer with time.
As honey ages
it develops medicinal qualities.
Therefore, Lord Krishna
has filled our hearts
not with vengeance
but a craving for justice.
Arjun is right, Panchali.
There is no need to brood.
Soon, the punishment for
the sons of Dhritarashtra
shall be announced.
And that punishment
shall be dictated by
the Arya clan's heiress.
The punishment of
the sons of Pandu
shall now be dictated by me!
The Pandavas
are still bound to dwell the
forests for 12 years, My Lord!
Because, before their exile
was complete
I had reckoned Arjun's truth.
When you saw Arjun
the sun had already set, Prince.
His exile has been a success.
You have to accept this fact,
Duryodhan, my boy.
That is justice.
When Arjun had entered
the battlefield with his bow
the night phase had
not yet begun, Grandsire.
It was indeed the last day
of their exile.
But the day had not passed then.
Therefore
the sons of Pandu
have to accept
dwelling the forests
for 12 years
and a year of exile.
This is law, Grandsire.
Duryodhan has violated
all codes of law, elder brother.
Even now he must be planning
something new for sure.
Brother Bheem is right.
Before brother Bheem
gets a chance to reign
we have to punish him.
If you have to catch a prey
quickness matters
more than strength.
But
is Grandsire's consent
not necessary
before launching the attack?
In order to retaliate
to our attack
what if Grandsire
enters the battlefield?
What do we do then?
Grandsire will not stand up
against us in the battlefield.
He knows who is just.
But Grandsire's duty
is to watch over
the throne of Hastinapur.
Greetings, teacher.
May you be victorious.
Are you prepared for the battle?
Certainly, teacher.
This is the first battle
of your life.
Are you scared?
Do you not trust me, teacher?
I can trust no one
but you, Arjun.
What is this?
It is a riddle, teacher.
And I am trying
to figure it out.
Greetings.
Do not let
any of the Princes die.
Take all of them in
as prisoners!
Only then will Bhishma
come here
to die at your hands.
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
Greetings, teacher.
May you be victorious.
Yudhishthir
there's quite the responsibility
on your shoulders
because you are the eldest.
The respect garnered
from the victory
will be yours.
And even the insult
of the defeat
will be attributed to you.
Be it a battle or politics,
teacher
victory belongs to every person
but defeat belongs
only to the King.
If we are successful
in paying you your fee
then it will be the success
of the 105 disciples of yours.
But the throne of Hastinapur
cannot have 105 Kings,
brother Yudhishthir!
You must have understood
the meaning by now.
This battle is
not being fought only
to pay our teacher his fee.
The truth is, this battle
is not between the Kuru Princes
and King Drupad.
It is between you and me.
Answer my question, teacher.
When our capabilities were being
weighed in terms of your fee
did you have no knowledge then
that all this was being done
in the favour of Yudhishthir?
The test of your capabilities
was not devised by me, Prince.
You should ask this question
to your father.
In the name of righteousness,
my father
has always been the recipient
of deception, teacher.
But I do not wish
to discuss this with you.
If I use my might
to pay you your fee, teacher
then you cannot object to it.
What do you mean?
It means, brother Yudhishthir
that in this battle
the help of you or your brothers
will not be required by me.
In this battle, only
the Kauravas will participate.
How can that be?
If only the Kauravas
fight in this battle
brother won't get an opportunity
to prove his capability.
There is no other alternative,
brother Bheem.
Anyone older than me
cannot participate
in this battle.
We 100 brothers
shall have
the fruits of our valour
and you five
getting a share in it
is an injustice I cannot allow.
Arjun, Nakul, Sahadev
can participate in the battle.
But I shall be the General.
And the victory
shall be attributed to me.
We cannot accept that.
That was not my request!
The duty and right to pay
our teacher his fee
belong to all the disciples.
I shall also deem you a partner
in paying the fee, Arjun.
I give you my word.
Then why do you worry?
Besides, our teacher
wants us to pay his fee
by defeating Drupad.
But the participance
of all the Princes
was not something
he explicitly mentioned.
And what if we
do not accept this?
Then, in the battle, you will
either keep an eye
on Drupad's army
or on the weapons
of my brothers.
We Kuru Princes are
on the borders of Panchal
and us fighting in this manner
is inappropriate, Duryodhan.
This is an insult to our
dynasty and kingdom.
I give you
the first opportunity.
Go on.
May you be victorious!
Brother Yudhishthir
what did you do?
If we do not even
participate in the battle
then we will have no chance
to win, brother Yudhishthir.
Sahadev, why don't you
say something?
I feel, this is an apt strategy.
The enemy is approaching!
Order the first unit of cavalry
to march forth!
The Princes must not
get hurt, General!
They are to be taken in
only as prisoners.
None of the Princes should be
able to leave the battlefield!
I want all the Princes alive!
Soldiers!
Take your positions!
The enemy is approaching!
Attack!
Dusshasan, Vikarna
the army approaching us
is not an army
but a horde of rats!
Hastinapur has defeated them
countless times.
We shall chop Drupad's head off
and hang it on his castle,
brother Duryodhan!
Attack!
Brother Duryodhan,
just look at Drupad's army!
It is easier to defeat them than
harvesting grains from fields!
We are the Kauravas!
No one can defeat us!
Keep attacking.
Drupad must
certainly be at the center
of his army.
Soldiers, change your positions!
Get back to the positions
allocated to all of you!
Do remember!
The Kuru Princes
need to be captured alive!
What are they doing now,
brother Duryodhan?
They must be getting ready
to form a labyrinth.
But you need not worry!
A 'Sharvyooh' can help navigate
through any type of labyrinth!
Organize yourselves
in the form of an arrow!
And keep your weapons
facing outward!
Allow the Princes
to come inside!
Open the second gate
and close the first one!
Your Majesty
the first gate has been closed
and we have surrounded
the enemy on all the sides.
Splendid. Keep opening
the gates in this manner
and once the enemy is inside
close all the gates behind them!
This is the labyrinth
of King Drupad!
King Drupad's labyrinth!
They will be caught in it
like a fly in a spider web
these ignorant Princes.
Close all the gates one by one!
Our strategy was a success,
Shikhandini.
Take all the Princes in
as prisoners!
None of the Princes
should escape!
W-What is happening,
brother Duryodhan?
We were winning the battle
but how did we end up
becoming prisoners?
They have sealed the exits,
Dusshasan.
Never did I imagine that
Drupad would construct
such a labyrinth.
Even I do not know how to
navigate through this labyrinth.
What do we do now,
brother Duryodhan?
I must now make
my way to Drupad.
Two of the Princes
are still fighting.
I will capture them,
Your Majesty.
In order to defeat these boys
if I have to employ
the Five Gems of mine
then it will be
your defeat, Shikhandini.
I will not let that happen,
father.
I will not let that happen!
You?
Will you fight me?
Does Panchal now
live under the protection
of maidens?
You need to protect
yourself first, Prince.
I am your doom!
Is this what you call
might, King Drupad?
What were you thinking when
making a woman your General?
I have defeated her
with just one blow.
And because of her, even you
got defeated this easily.
Are you absolutely certain
that I am the King of Panchal
Drupad?
Or am I?
Or maybe it's me.
Or am I the real
King of Panchal, Drupad?
Who is the real
King of Panchal, Drupad?
You will sit right here
and mourn, sire.
My conscience curses you!
A curse!
N-No...
No, Vidura.
No, Vidura.
Vidura...
Vidura...
Gandhari.
G-Gandhari...
Gandhari!
G-Gandhari!
Gandhari...
Mother!
I have turned old.
In one day it feels like I have borne
a decade long pain and turned old.
Mother
all of us feel
burdened today.
What kind of a strange
situation this is, mother?
We knew the consequences
for which grandsire himself
has prepared us.
But when we were faced
with that situation
the head was unable
to bear it, mother.
You're right, son.
The very thought of pain
scares a person.
But the experience
crushes his head.
Like every part of you
is experiencing pain.
One can overcome fear
through determination
but he cannot get rid
of the pain, son.
Mother-in-law
duty always causes pain.
That's why people try to escape
from performing their duties.
This battle is our duty.
All those who die
in this battle...
We'll mourn their deaths
together
once the battle ends
for the rest of our lives.
But now
is not the time to mourn,
mother-in-law.
Panchali is right, mother.
If a warrior
mourns his troubles all night
then the next day
at the battlefield
he does not have
the courage to even stand.
And the battle is not over yet.
We have to focus on our strategy
for tomorrow.
So that our patience
is not shattered
grandsire is still
holding on to his breath.
We will serve grandsire
continuously.
We will take care of his needs
day and night.
Turn by turn, each of us
will serve grandsire.
Panchali
give me food and water
for grandsire.
I will serve him today.
Grandsire, I have brought
some medicines for you.
Some food and water too.
Please have them.
Son Arjun
what benefit can
this body of mine gain
from food, medicines,
water, et cetera?
But, grandsire, if your
pain is reduced
only then will the pain
in our heads reduce.
You may have ordered us
to go fight the battle
but if you're going to be
in this state
then how will we get
the strength to fight?
How will we be able
to fight?
Do us a favour,
grandsire.
Answer a question of mine.
Can a person
remain disease free
with medicines?
No, grandsire.
The body heaIs itself.
Medicines only lend support
You are right, Arjun.
This body of mine also
does not need these
medicines any more.
My body does not
want to heal.
Until 'Uttarayana'*
*"Uttara" (North) and "ayana" (movement), the northward movement of the Sun on the celestial sphere, between January 14 and July 16.
I will hold on
to this body
I don't need anything more
than this, Arjun.
Have some water at least.
I am the son of Ganga.
This water will not be able
to quench my thirst, son.
Every part of me
desires for the water
in which my body
is destined to be immersed.
You have the strength
to unite
my mother and I, son.
But
this battlefield of Kurukshetra
has turned harsh
because of the blood
it drank.
And harshness, be it
of the land or of the head
doesn't have place for purity.
Make enough place in this land
so that my mother
can get in, son.
Please do so, dear.
That is more than enough for me.
Forgive me, mother.
Today
I will not be
able to
stand to bow down
in your respect.
A father feels delighted
with such respect, son.
A mother feels real
happiness only
when her child places his head
on her lap.
Son of Pandu, Arjun
I will reside here
from now on
and take care of my son.
You're free of this
responsibility, dear.
Don't feel sad
because of his agony.
Fortunate are those
who in old age
get an opportunity
to be a child once more.
Go
and carry out your duties.
May you prosper.
Though I am your son
I have committed grave crimes.
The ones
whose welfare was my priority
were also welled up with tears
due to me.
Why so, mother?
Son.
You are able to distinguish
what is righteous
just as the rays of the Sun.
Hence, the ones
who cannot see righteousness
cannot have their minds
read by you.
You have been hard
on yourself your whole life, son.
Any person who is hard
on himself
cannot behave tenderly
towards others, son.
You were never bound
to attachments.
Hence the ones
blinded by attachments
were only punished, by you.
You haven't taught them
a lesson.
Yes, mother.
If I had been able to accept
others' weaknesses
then perhaps I would have
found a solution for it.
This is my error.
It is not your fault, son.
Instead, it is my fault.
I have not passed down
any unholiness or weakness
to you.
To know others' weaknesses
it is necessary for
some weakness to exist
in oneself.
Only the one who battles
with his weakness
can impart knowledge
about it.
You are the epitome of purity
in this world, mother.
Then how
did this son of yours
turn into an unholy person?
How so, mother?
You are not unholy, Devavrata.
You have lived as the epitome
of holiness, my son.
Then why
do I not receive salvation,
mother?
I am here for that
very purpose, son.
Your tasks in life that
you have considered as
your virtues
and all that you have considered
as your sins
need to be renunciated, my dear.
Let those toils be washed away
with these droplets of blood
from your body.
Become the epitome
of knowledge, my son.
When a person capable enough
comes to you for that knowledge
then renunciate even that.
At that moment I shall
engulf you in my tides.
Till that moment
I shall stay near you, son.
Subsequent to your death
on earth
I shall wait for
the time of your rebirth
in the Heavens, son.
Today
the thirst of my life
has subsided, mother.
It is now quenched.
Oh, great warriors!
Grandsire Bhishma's defeat
is no reason for us
to be frustrated.
The Pandavas
have not defeated him.
Due to his oath
he gave up his weapons.
Neither has this
added to the valour
of our adversaries
nor has it increased
their chances of victory.
Do not forget, my great warriors
that in eight directions
eight gigantic elephants
jointly bear the weight
of the sky.
They are called legends.
The fall of one legend
would not let the sky collapse.
Grandsire Bhishma was
certainly a great warrior.
But we do possess
other undefeated warriors
as him.
It is hard for even Lord Indra
to retribute to his arrows.
He has immense power
and owns divine weapons.
Similar to Grandsire Bhishma
he is also the disciple
of Lord Parashuram.
Oh, great warriors!
Going forward,
in the battle-field
you shall be lead
by your commander-in-chief.
Disciple of Lord Parashuram
and a great warrior
Karna, the king of Anga.
Oh, great Karna!
The time to demonstrate
your valour has come.
Dear friend, Karna.
I have complete faith in you.
You do not have any reason
to be biased
towards the Pandavas.
Neither are you related
to the Pandavas
nor are they your disciples.
Dear, Karna.
You and only you
shall annihilate those Pandavas.
There should indeed be a war,
Grandsire.
I do not approve of this war.
Grandsire Bheeshma
is right indeed.
Nothing can be more unfortunate
than war, my lad.
Uncle!
- But...
A clever human is the one
who always strives to ensure
there is no war in his yard.
If today there is no war
in Virat's yard
in future,
in the yard
of Hastinapur
there shall be an epic battle.
Grandsire Bheeshma.
At that time, you shall be
the commander in chief.
And at the blade of your sword
shall lie the heads
of the Pandavas.
Are you here to destroy
Hastinapur,
Lord of Gandhar?
Me?
Do you think I am here
to destroy?
I am here
just to
fulfill your word,
Grandsire Bheeshma.
You had arrived to Gandhar.
You had my beloved sister
betrothed
with a promise
that you shall make her
the empress of Hastinapur
and that her hundred sons
will be the rulers
of Hastinapur.
That you shall make them
the sovereign rulers.
How badly could the promise
made by you fail
Grandsire Bheeshma.
If an elephant's foot
comes into a crocodile's grasp
it causes a huge dilemma
to the crocodile
Grandsire Bheeshma.
It can neither devour
the colossal elephant
nor can it spare the elephant.
Now, it is my request to you
Grandsire Bheeshma.
Either crown my dear lad
Duryodhan
as the sovereign ruler
or, because of you
Hastinapur shall face
annihilation.
Please come forth,
revered commander in chief.
The fortress of Virat
awaits to be destroyed
by your hands.
Bahika'.*
*Madra was a part of the Bahika/Vahika or Madra was Vahika country, at current central parts of Punjab  between river Chenab and Ravi.
Your majesty.
A vast army has laid siege
to the northern gate.
All our forces must go
for the defence of Virat.
I shall lead the charge.
- Your Majesty!
Even I will participate.
My Lord, please do not
participate in the battle yet.
If I feel I am losing the battle
I shall send you a message.
No, Your Majesty.
I cannot stand back.
My Lord, someone has to stay to
defend the fortress from within.
Arjun shall stay in the fortress
to defend women and children.
Because he cannot charge
into battle guised as a woman.
Won't I participate in the war?
What mockery is this,
elder brother?
Bheem is right, Arjun.
You must stay
within the fortress.
But...
Arjun. If Duryodhan sees
a woman in the battlefield
he shall surely doubt.
Let us go, My Lord.
My brothers and I
are ready for
the defence of Virat.
Please come.
Soldiers!
Defend your Kingdom.
Charge!
Please give our forces
the orders to charge
Commander in chief.
Virat has not yet shown any sign
of defence,
King of Gandhar.
If King Virat won't arm himself
how could we attack them?
But the preliminary attack
on the fortresses has begun
Grandsire.
How can there be an attack
without my orders
king of Gandhar?
Who ordered it?
Only the army of Hastinapur
takes orders from you
My Lord.
And I didn't order the attack.
The attack was made by King Susharman of Trigartha.*
*Modern Kangra district, the territory around the three rivers of Satluj, Beas, and Ravi.
Please give the orders
for the attack, My Lord.
Grandsire!
Greetings My Queen.
A vast army led by Hastinapur
has attacked the southern gate.
An attack from the other side?
But there is no one in
the fortress who can defend it.
Who shall go forth
for retaliation?
Forgive me, My Queen.
But Prince Uttar
is inside the fortress.
And it is the duty of the prince
to retaliate to this attack.
Yes!
I shall charge into the battle.
How is that possible?
Uttar is still very young.
He has no experience in battle.
No! No!
He cannot charge
into the battle.
Excuse me, My Queen.
But the son of a king cannot be
exempted from his duty.
I do not wish to be exempted,
either.
I am eager for battle, mother.
Be quiet!
Brihannala is neither a man,
nor a woman.
How would a eunuch know the
gravity of politics and battle?
My Queen.
There is no need
to insult Brihannala.
Brihannala handled the reins
of Prince Arjun's chariot.
And has faced many battles.
And even now, I am ready to be
the rider of Prince Uttar's
chariot.
Before any weapon
lays a scratch on Prince Uttar
It shall have to go through me.
This is my promise.
I shall instill the son of
the great warrior King Virat
with bravery
and not cowardice.
But will a woman
drive my chariot?
If that happens
all shall mock me.
But when your weapons
slay them
you shall be the one
laughing at them, Prince.
Come.
But, Brihannala.
Grandsire Bheeshma
is at the forefront.
What if he comes to know
of who the chariot rider is?
I do not fear
Grandsire Bheeshma.
And Prince Duryodhan
cannot recognise me before dusk.
Just a few hours remain
for my exile to come to an end.
Where are the Pandavas, uncle?
Why aren't they showing up?
It shall be dusk soon!
We do not have much time, uncle!
Did I not tell you, my lad?
The righteous ones
can witness treachery
but cannot commit it.
Look over there!
The Pandavas have arrived!
Uncle.
Look at this!
The prince of Virat is here
under a woman's protection.
He is a lad, Dushyasan.
Yet he has arrived for battle.
But those five Pandavas
have still not arrived
for battle.
They must be hiding
as a rat hides in a burrow.
Blow the conch, my lad.
They are hiding somewhere
inside Virat.
Arjun!
Come out!
Let go of your safety
and protect your honour.
Even Karna must be arriving
in order to slay you!
Come out!
With your bow, the 'Gandiva'!
Prince Uttar, pick up your bow!
Shoot arrows how I instruct you.
I shall not let anything
happen to you.
Pick up your bow!
Shoot, Prince!
Shoot the arrow!
Shoot, Prince Uttar!
Shoot the arrow, Prince Uttar!
Uncle, this lad must be slain!
If this prince dies
maybe those five Pandavas
shall show themselves.
Before the sun sets
we must drive them out.
Very well, my lad.
Grandsire Bheeshma!
Order our forces to attack!
I do not attack women,
king of Gandhar.
Only when a warrior arrives
shall my army charge forth
and my weapons will unsheathe.
Prepare for battle, prince!
Only a few moments remain.
I shall not let you be harmed.
- No, Brihannala!
I cannot fight
these warriors
and this vast army.
Protect me, Brihannala!
Steer the chariot
back to the fortress.
If you wish to be
a strong warrior
of the likes of prince Arjun
first learn to stand your ground
in the battlefield.
Raise your bow,
shoot an arrow!
You say Arjun is
a great warrior?
A warrior who is hiding
inside the fortress.
They claim that the Pandavas
are hiding in our fortress.
Then why won't they
come forth to protect us.
Protection is acquired by those
who dare to raise
their weapons first.
Prince Uttar,
raise your weapons!
Just a few moments more!
- No, Brihannala!
I cannot do it!
Protect me, Brihannala!
Steer the chariot away
from here, Brihannala!
Go' prince!
Go!
Your father has given
refuge to the Pandavas.
Before the sun sets
send the Pandavas
out of these gates.
Or else, every citizen
within this fortress shall die.
Go!
Warn Arjun!
Brihannala!
Why did you bring
the chariot here?
Steer it back into the fortress.
Brihannala!
Oh Fire God!
Today, it shall be a year
to my exile.
Today I am free to turn into
Arjun from Brihannala.
But today my mettle
shall be put to test as well.
And without your grace
this devotee of yours
is incomplete.
Please return my 'Gandiva' bow
and grace me, O' Lord!
What happened, mother Kunti?
What happened, Kunti?
I do not know, sister-in-law
but
it feels as though
something very bad has happened.
Mother.
Mother, did brother Bhim
come this way?
No
but weren't all of you together?
We were but now he's not to
be seen around, mother.
I seem to be having
a premonition, mother.
Mother Kunti,
I had seen brother Bhim
going with brother Duryodhan.
But that was
quite a long time ago.
If he is with Duryodhan
then you need not be afraid.
He will be back.
I hope, nothing bad happened
with the two of them.
Sahadev, ask Arjun to go look
for the two of them.
Go on.
- Alright, mother.
Uncle!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Beloved Duryodhan, in order
to secure your place as the king
you have taken
the first step today.
Now, dump his dead body
in the river Ganges.
The dead bodies of people that
are submerged in the Ganges
go straight to heaven.
This is a popular belief.
Then is he
d-dead, uncle?
Why are you getting
so scared, dear?
Death comes to all.
Do remember.
A kingdom always thrives
upon a heap of dead bodies.
The greed for polity
engulfs every man's heart.
Every person makes an effort
to create a state of his own.
That state might be
as big as that of Kuru
or only limited to one's family.
Man always makes an effort
to gain foothold of polity.
But what is
the real form of polity?
Have we ever thought about it?
A person who influences
the lives of many people
and is able to curtail
the freedom of many
experiences more polity.
The real form of polity is one's
influence over another's life.
But is real influence
not made up of love,
kindness, compassion
and righteousness?
When man uses cruelty and
unrighteousness to gain polity
he gives birth to protest and
revolt in the hearts of others.
And the result...
The result
is somewhat like this.
Yes.
He may find himself influential
and powerful for some time
but that is not true polity.
This is the reason
why sages like Bhrigu
and Vashishth are still revered
but not Ravan
and Hiranyakashipu.
Do certainly give it a thought.
Am I correct?
When gold is excavated from
the ground, King Dhritarashtra
it is mixed with
various forms of impurities.
Similarly, when a student
comes to a teacher
the love of his parents
and the security of a home
cause arrogance, fear
and stubbornness
as the impurities to be in him.
When gold is subjected to fire
it first starts to emit smoke.
This smoke
is due to the burning
of the impurities within it.
When all vile traits
are reduced to nothing
and when dedication
is born within a student
only then does he
become a disciple.
Only then does he accept
his teacher as his guru.
A teacher imparts
only knowledge to a student
but a guru
by realising the possibilities
that lie within his student
makes him successful.
I am here to become
the guru of the princes.
And by gaining knowledge
from you
the Princes of the Kuru dynasty
will become the best warriors
of this world.
This is what the royal court
of the Kuru kingdom believes
son of Sage Bharadwaj Drona.
His Highness has only
one expectation from you
that you must teach only
the Princes of the Kuru dynasty.
I too wish the same.
But
there is just one condition.
My son Ashwatthama will also
learn along with the princes.
Because
a son learns constantly
from his father.
We accept this condition,
Dronacharya.
Very soon, near the borders
of Hastinapur
a hermitage with various
conveniences will be built.
You may reside there
with your family
and impart knowledge
to the Princes of Kuru.
Pardon me, Chief Minister.
But the hermitage will be built
miles away from Hastinapur.
Because a honey bee that
does not leave its nest behind
and travel far away from it
it is unable to gather honey.
I do not accept this condition,
sire.
The Princes of Kuru
will live in Hastinapur
and get their education.
Then accepting them
as my disciples
isn't possible for me,
Your Highness.
Before making a decision,
think about it, Dronacharya.
That past incident of your life
is something the entire kingdom
of Arya is familiar with.
Apart from Hastinapur, is there
a kingdom powerful enough
that can give you shelter?
My Past, my weight
are my gems, Your Highness!
And I have not come here with
the wish of seeking shelter.
I am in search of worthy princes
to whom I can give charity.
The most noble charity
in the world.
That of knowledge.
But if the Princes of Kuru
value their comfort
more than my knowledge
then I must go someplace else
and look for my disciples.
Allow me to leave.
Your Highness,
with your permission
I would like to see off
my brother-in-law to his abode.
He is my guest.
- Permission granted.
And Chief Minister
start looking
for another teacher at once.
The Princes of Kuru dynasty
have always been pure gold.
They need not be purified.
They merely need to be moulded.
Stop, Dronacharya.
Do not be stubborn.
You will not get such
a golden opportunity again.
Tell this to your king.
The event of the past
has made you stubborn
but to earn money for my sister
and her son is your duty.
For how long can a mixture
of rice flour and water
be considered as milk and
consumed by my nephew?
I am well aware of my son
and wife's discomfort
Kripacharya.
You need not remind me of it.
I had knowingly
accepted this poverty.
And very soon, I shall acquire
immense wealth as well.
And the path to that
is through these steps.
In order to climb the steps
of the palace of Hastinapur
many Brahmins and Kshatriyas
are ever ready.
The one who can fearlessly
descend these steps
has the right
to ascend them as well.
You need not worry
because a guru
chooses his disciples.
A disciple is not wise enough
to choose his guru.
And I have chosen my disciples.
The Princes of Kuru
will become only my disciples.
Brother Bhim?
Brother Bhim?
Brother Bhim?
Search for son of Pandu, Bhim
till the boundaries
of the region of Arya!
Go to the farthest ends
of the earth if you have to!
Search for Prince Bhim
at the cost of your lives!
Go!
My son...
Where is he, Maha Kaal?*
*The destroyer of one who destroys i.e annihilator (Shiva).
Answer me!
How can you let a woman
suffer the fate
of losing her child?
My tears
will submerge
the entire universe.
My son...
Return him to me.
Return my Bhim to me.
Lord Vayu!* Where are you?
*The Lord of the winds, the father of Bhima.
You had promised me
that you shall
always protect my son.
He is a part of you.
Protect him, Lord!
Protect him.
Brother-in-law
I accept your request.
I...
I will not leave Hastinapur
and go anywhere.
My darling
you now have
everlasting protection.
Now, you may do anything
but the sons of Pandu
will not be able to attack you.
Dear Draupadi
always...
Always be there for my sons.
Henceforth
it is your duty to dispense
advice to them.
How can I ever give them
any advice, mother-in-law?
Your sons need your affection
and experience,
mother-in-law.
No, dear.
A mother
thinks of the happiness
of her sons.
But a wife...
Along with the happiness
of her husband, a wife
also thinks of his honour.
Now...
Now that it is time
for my sons to have
their share of honour
and by conquering the world
they have the opportunity
to make their ancestors proud
maybe...
Maybe my motherly love...
My motherly love
may obstruct their path.
A decision taken by fate
is always correct,
dear
No, mother.
This decision of fate
is not correct.
Fate is hard-hearted.
Without your cheerful face
to guide us
how will we ever
find our way, mother?
How will we find our way...
What uncle did was unjust!
He has no right to drive
our mother away from us.
How can a mother
ever go away
from her children, Nakul?
I am...
I am always with you.
But
this is my home.
I had come here with my husband.
Brother-in-law is correct.
I can either live here
or in some hermitage
in the woods.
Until I am alive
there is no other place
I can call home, son.
But mother...
This is not the time
for such things, son.
Do remember.
No matter what situation
you face in your life
all of you must accept the
decisions made by Yudhishthir.
You will not argue with him.
You should go now, sons.
I will...
I will employ my tears
to wash away
all the hurdles
that come in your path.
Grandsire
let's proceed.
Under your guidance,
we five brothers
will try to establish
a righteous kingdom.
I have firm faith,
Yudhishthir
that the prestige of our
ancestors will indeed
be augmented by you.
That you will never go astray
from the path of righteousness.
Mark my words,
dear
that greed is the basis
of all that is unrighteous.
Rule your kingdom
but do not ever covet it.
You may indeed earn wealth
but do not ever covet it.
Do not ever get envious
of someone else's wealth.
And
do not ever flaunt your wealth.
Only contentment and restraint
can strengthen
your righteousness.
Grandsire
are you not coming with us?
Time is a prominent
form of a 'yajna.
It is a 'yajna' that
goes on for eternity.
In that 'yajna
all of us are required to offer
ourselves as the sacrifice.
And that sacrifice
helps in the establishment
of righteousness in this world.
I have taken the decision
that now...
Now, it is time for me
to be the sacrifice.
Why did you not tell us
before, grandsire
that you had promised to stay
here in Hastinapur?
Then we would never have
asked for dividing the kingdom.
For this very reason, dear.
For exactly this reason.
I knew that
if I tell you
then maybe you would not
accept the new kingdom.
And
for you to have your own kingdom
was far more important.
Grandsire
by giving a kingdom
uncle has snatched
a lot from us.
No, dear.
One's cornerstone
is honouring the limits
of one's competence.
So must I.
Think of it like this, dear
that by snatching everything
you had, Dhritarashtra
has challenged your competence.
I have firm faith
that the city you establish
in Khandavprastha
will forever act as
the center of the entire
Aryan region.
But who will live
with us, grandsire?
A King has his subjects.
And for the subjects
to stay with their King
denotes the King's success.
Look over there.
All of them are with you.
King Yudhishthir
all of us will come with you.
We will help you establish
the new kingdom.
By leaving Hastinapur empty
we cannot establish
our kingdom, Vrishbhan.
When you leave
Hastinapur will become empty
anyway, Your Highness.
Take us with you.
We will serve you.
We will do what you ask us to.
She...
She is my daughter,
Your Highness.
She will be a handmaiden
to Her Highness.
She will serve her.
What is your name?
Vrushali.
Hastinapur can only be your
enemy henceforth, Vasudev!
Very soon, the army of
Hastinapur will attack Dwaraka!
We are outside the borders
of Dwaraka now, My Lord.
You should rest for a while
after which you can take
the reins of the chariot.
You and your brother
can never be fully
understood by me.
If your head cannot aid you
in understanding someone
then you should give
your heart to that person.
I must look for a 'Brahmin
and get married to you soon
otherwise your brother Balaram
may come and take you away.
Marriage!
In the woods!
No, My Lord.
I will not get married
in the woods.
I wish to get married
only in a 'mandap.
How can I build a 'mandap
in these woods?
You need not
build one, My Lord.
You are still not well
acquainted with my brother.
When a 'mandap' was
being built in Dwaraka
brother pointed to it and said
Subhadra, look.
You will get married
in that 'mandap.
So, I will certainly
get married there.
You are not well acquainted
with King Shakuni of Gandhar.
Something major troubles me
at the moment.
King Shakuni of Gandhar
will certainly
make Hastinapur and Dwaraka
fight each other.
And even Indraprastha
is not yet independent.
I too shall be ordered
to fight Madhav with my Gandiva.
And not only the army of
Hastinapur, Vasudev Krishna
but also that of Indraprastha
shall take part in this battle!
You seem to be forgetting
that Indraprastha
is not yet independent.
The person for whom
you have insulted our King
that very person
will come to fight you with
his Gandiva outside Dwaraka
Vasudev!
Aunt
my beloved sister is your
daughter-in-law now.
Hastinapur and Dwaraka
may have become enemies
but I am certain that you will
not punish my sister for it.
Even the person who chops
a tree down and burns it
keeps the fruits
of that tree safely.
This is tradition.
I cannot welcome Subhadra, dear.
The property
may have been divided
but not the rights.
The right to welcome a new
daughter-in-law lies solely
with the King and the Queen.
This is a major problem.
His Excellency
if Hastinapur does not
welcome Arjun's wife
then it would mean
that Hastinapur has
accepted Indraprastha
as an independent state.
King Dhritarashtra
you must welcome Arjun's wife
and deem Dwaraka
a part of family
otherwise
you must declare the sons
of Pandu independent.
What do you suggest
His Excellency Bhishma?
Dear Dhritarashtra
you must welcome Arjun.
My darling
Vasudev is no longer your enemy.
He is my enemy now.
I will crush the Yadavas
even if the entire Aryan region
is set ablaze with
the fire of a war.
Greetings, mother!
Arjun!
Son
heat of a fire turns
gold ores into pure gold.
Similarly
after every struggle
my sons become more glorious.
I am very proud of you, son.
When a mother has the capability
of challenging her own self
her sons are bound to be
powerful, mother.
While deciding not to
come to Indraprastha
your heart must have broken
into a thousand pieces.
I can only imagine what you
must have gone through.
I can only imagine it.
Do not worry for me, son.
In order to find a pearl
its shell is bound to be broken.
No, mother.
We will not let that happen.
We will not.
As you had instructed
we will become independent
and Indraprastha
shall be sanctified
by your presence.
Let's go, son.
Krishna has said that your
penance is now over.
You must now get married
return to Indraprastha soon
and perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna.
Indraprastha awaits you, son.
Her Highness
Prince Bheem has
sent this 'laddoo.
My Lord Bheem knows
that My Lord Arjun has
the right to me this year.
So, I too shall spend this year
engrossed in a penance.
I consume only two
food items every day.
He knows this quite well
and hence, has sent
only one 'laddoo
for you to taste.
He has made this himself.
He has said that if black gram
is soaked overnight...
- That is enough.
I will not be able to understand
his culinary skills.
Place the 'laddoo
on the plantain leaf
and take away
this bowl of 'kheer.
Will you
eat just this much,
Her Highness?
Yes.
This is a penance.
My Lord Arjun
must also have been
doing the same for years.
Panchali, as ordered by
righteousness and tradition
I am going to marry again.
With this marriage,
my dedication to you
will indeed magnify.
I promise you this.
I hope I have
your permission for this.
May this wife of mine
have your love and protection.
Give us your blessings, uncle.
Bless you.
Dear Subhadra
welcome to the Kuru dynasty.
Now, you and Arjun need not
come to Hastinapur
to seek our blessings.
You may go to Indraprastha.
On behalf of the
Kuru dynasty, the present
will be sent over to you
in Indraprastha.
Let's go, Gandhari
Vikarna.
Queen Mother
your daughter-in-law
seeks your blessings.
May you be blessed with a son.
Bless you.
Greetings, grandsire.
Stop, dear.
Do not touch my feet.
I will not be able to
give you my blessings.
A blessing is an expression
of one's emotions.
The one who dips
his hand in a reservoir
is bound to get water.
The reservoir has
no say in this.
Similarly
people who seek the
blessings of their elders
are bound to receive it.
A reservoir that has dried up
no longer yields
any water, Vasudev.
Upon seeing this
unrighteous deed
my heart too has dried up.
Which unrighteous deed,
Your Excellency?
The Kuru dynasty has been
insulted in this 'mandap' today!
A maiden meant to marry someone
cannot be married to
someone else, Vasudev.
So, do the feelings
of the maiden
have no importance?
If you had given your word
after asking the maiden
then it would have been correct.
But disregarding tradition
in this manner is incorrect.
A human being can trust another
only when traditions
are adhered to.
Traditions...
Traditions
are like mangoes.
When they are born,
they taste bitter.
After a while,
they taste sour.
Only the ones
who like the sour taste
accept them readily.
And after some more time
they taste sweet.
They become
everyone's favourite.
But after a point of time
they turn to mush.
They begin to reek,
Your Excellency.
The person who
consumes them falls ill.
And in the end, all that
is left are the dried up pits
which are of no use to anyone.
I have nothing against
traditions, Your Excellency
but when they become
a tool of exploitation
and begin to give
sorrow instead of joy
they should be
buried in the earth
in order to give rise
to newer ones.
Who gets to decide
which tradition is decaying?
You, Vasudev?
No
time will decide that
and everyone must obey the
rules of time, Your Excellency.
For the entire Aryan region
this is the time of 'sankranti.'*
*Transmigration of the Sun from one zodiac to the next.
The way Surya Dev changes
his course in a 'sankranti
similarly
the entire Aryan region
is about to change its course.
Old traditions will break
old empires will crumble to dust
new definitions of righteousness
will be written
and a new era will be ushered,
Maharathi Bhishma!
And in this cycle of time,
you must decide
on which side you wish to be
because everyone will be caught
in this vortex of time.
People who have chosen
the path of unrighteousness
will usher this change
and the ones who have
chosen that of righteousness
will establish the new era.
This is pre-decided.
After 15 months.
Greetings.
What message have you
brought, Ayurvati?
There are no signs of labour,
Your Highness.
How is that possible,
Ayurvati?
A woman should bear
a child in nine months.
And Gandhari has been
pregnant for 15 months now.
Why has she not gone
into labour yet?
Disperse all!
Gandhari
you have been pregnant for
more than a year.
Then why haven't you
gone into labour yet?
Why has my son not taken
birth yet?
The one who had given you
the blessing of a 100 sons...
Ask of the same God!
Forget about 100 sons
my first son hasn't been
able to take birth yet!
Why?
I have been asking the same
question to Lord Shiva.
Like the future
even He is silent.
- That's the problem, Gandhari!
Not the solution!
I am interested only
in the solution.
What do I do, my lord?
One can only wait for
the sun to rise
not try to make it happen.
In the same way
we have to wait for the
happiness fated...
I am not interested in these
lessons of yours.
I need a son.
I need my heir.
Find a solution to that.
Seek a solution to that!
Or I'll have to get a son from
another woman, Gandhari.
My lord...
- To bear a son for her husband
is the foremost responsibility
of a princess.
The reason I married you
is this boon.
And if you cannot bear a son
then this marriage is a
deception! A betrayal!
My heart now questions
me, Gandhari
if the Lord has even given
you any such boon.
Or in order to get
you married
your father spread this
false story.
Remember, Gandhari
if the wife cannot
bear a son
then the king does not feel
any affection for her.
Because to give the kingdom
its heir
is the duty of a king.
Hence, you can observe fasts,
perform rituals!
For this!
The penance that you had
gone through
in order to get this boon.
Go through a more strenuous
penance...
Your brother is secretly
overhearing us!
Let him know too
that between a king
and his wife
love can exist
only when that love
is linked to a progeny.
A child...
Lord!
There is a message from
Hastinapur.
Why does the minister
always send a riddle
instead of a message?
This is not a riddle.
To maintain the confidentiality
such language is used.
Lord, only you can
read his message.
Here it is.
What happened, Lord?
Is it any troubling news?
What kind of a trouble
is this, Lord?
Did you give me a boon or
a curse to have 100 sons?
You gave me the lamp
then why don't You
give me the light?
If You have given me the path
then why not the pace?
What kind of kindness is this
which has become
the trouble to my happiness!
Lord, rid me of this pain.
Help my husband
in quelling his unrest.
Until I deliver my husband's son
I'll keep meditating
in this temple, God.
I'll keep meditating.
Lord, is it true that the love
between a king and a queen
is connected to their baby?
Why such a question, Kunti?
I am worried for
sister-in-law, Lord.
After a lot of difficulties,
she got brother-in-law's love.
What if... - You are getting
worried unnecessarily, Kunti.
A baby is the fruit of love.
Not the reason to fall in love.
I can't give you and Madri
any progeny
then has your
love reduced for me?
No, Lord.
Not even in my dreams.
Then don't worry
about sister-in-law.
This is an unfortunate time
for the whole Kuru lineage.
Even these times will
certainly pass away.
The shedding of the leaves is
not the end of the tree.
The spring certainly ushers
in new leaves, Kunti.
Kunti, God would have
certainly planned something
even for the Kuru lineage.
Lord, you are so patient
and tolerant.
Because the Kuru lineage
has witnessed
such unfortunate time
even before.
During the death of my father
Vichitravirya's
there was no successor.
Then grandsire
and Queen Mother
requested sage Vedvyas
for surrogacy.
What does that mean, Lord?
Yes.
When a capable sage
without any selfishness
only for the welfare
of the people
helps a women to get a son
the process is called 'Niyoga'.
The baby that's born
in such a situation
is considered to be
her husband's baby.
That baby is pure as the babies
born by the power of mantras.
But if the husband is alive
then the scriptures
don't permit this method.
I, sage Durvasa will
give you a mantra
by which you can call
upon any God
and by invoking that God
and can beget a son like
the same God.
The power of mantra
does not go in vain.
As soon as I disappear
a portion of my aura
will stay with you as a son.
You have a son, Lord.
My son is your son
because he's born with
the power of mantras.
He is pure.
Lord, you would surely ask me
as to why didn't I
tell this to you before.
But, Lord, in my heart
I used to feel
that wishing for a son
and becoming a mother
would be my selfishness.
To suffer the curse
upon you
is my foremost responsibility.
That's why, I kept quiet.
Which fact, Kunti?
Lord
Sage Durvasa had blessed me
with a boon.
He had given me a mantra
by which I could
invoke any God
and be blessed with a son
of His characteristics.
Is that really so, Kunti?
Yes, Lord.
Without conception
I can beget a son.
And Lord
I... - You are a beholder of such
a great boon, Kunti.
I can't believe
on my good fortune!
On our good fortune!
You have a solution
to the problem of Hastinapur.
Through you,
the struggle of Kuru lineage
can be overcome forever, Kunti.
But, please...
Hear me out, Lord...
- I've heard you, Kunti.
The king and the Kuru lineage
will be gratified by you.
Beget such a son
who is a scholar
of righteousness
knowledgeable of justice
future of the Kuru kingdom
the one who can be enthroned as
a ruler next to my elder brother
and the one who can be the
fruit of our marriage, Kunti.
The one, whom the entire world
accepts as my son
which would enhance my respect
all over.
Invoke the God of righteousness,
Lord Yama
and seek his blessings
in the form of a son for me.
I'll enquire a saint,
about the auspicious moment
to beget a son
and be right back.
What is the prediction according
to the planets
Master Jaimini?
Why isn't Gandhari
going into labour?
According to the horoscope,
I can assure you
that it's time for Hastinapur
to be blessed shortly
with its heir, His Highness.
At this time, the position of
the planets is really propitious
and the son born will be
a follower of righteousness
intellectual and will be
a believer of justice.
On one side, you say that a son
will be born in our lineage soon
and on the other side,
you're not able to give a reason
of why Gandhari's
not going into labour.
If you are an astrologer,
then please tell me
the reason of this incidence.
My master Vedvyas often says
just like the way a horse runs
on his feet
but his speed and direction are
controlled by the horse rider
similarly, the direction
and movement of humans' lives
are controlled by the Almighty.
If the expecting child is not
born before 1 month and 12 days
then the child would
bear demonic traits.
He shall be aware of
righteousness
but shan't follow that.
He shall bring disgrace to the
throne of Hastinapur, Highness.
Disgrace to the throne
of Hastinapur!
Kunti
I have appeared, being pleased
with your invocation.
You have invoked me
by chanting this mantra
so you must be having a desire
of obtaining a child.
Not just a child, Lord.
I want a son instilled with Your
characteristics in him.
We want a son
who shall be determined
in righteousness
one who can be mentor
to the kingdom of Hastinapur
who can be a reason of gladness
for my ancestors.
You both are really noble
that you think of righteousness
even before any kind of worldly
power and riches.
Righteousness stems from
mercy which comes from justice
and justice from patience.
In all the battles, struggles
and movements of life
the one who is calm and composed
the one who doesn't care for
relationships and self-benefit
before taking a decision
for righteousness
can have righteousness
in his heart.
Your son shall definitely be
somebody of this capability.
My son!
My son!
Kunti, Kuru lineage will always
be obliged to you.
My son will symbolise
the God of righteousness.
He'll always be patient during
battles.
My son
will be called Yudishthir.*
*Steady in war.
My beloved nephew!
The first stage of our plan
was successful.
Now, the desire of
leaving Hastinapur
and going to Varnavrat
will stem in the heart of Kunti.
Uncle
how do you know that?
My dear!
My beloved nephew!
One who is familiar with
the nature of a female serpent
only he can play a been
and manipulate her.
Purochan has gone to meet Kunti
to sow the seed of desire
to go to Varnavrat in her.
Varnavrat is just wonderful,
Her Highness.
Just wonderful.
The elephants there
seem like moving hills.
This was when
you were not married.
Prince Pandu
used to visit Varnavrat
to examine the elephants.
And he was a beloved King
of us subjects.
He was very benevolent
and affectionate towards us.
Do you remember, Purandiri?
I indeed remember, My Lord.
After he passed away, God seems
to have become angry with us.
So, we wish to invite your sons
to the Varnavrat Shiv temple
to have them conduct
a veneration there.
We have taken this oath.
I have had
a beautiful palace constructed
for you and the Princes,
Her Highness.
And you will face
no inconvenience there.
I do not doubt your
architectural knowledge
but going to Varnavrat
and living there
is not possible, Purochan.
Yudhishthir has been crowned
the Prince just recently.
He has many responsibilities.
As ordered by His Highness,
Bheem, Nakul and Sahadev
have gone out of the kingdom
to manage the border issues.
And Arjun has gone to Dwaraka.
If my sons decide to go there
I will have you informed.
Your sons have made
the decision, mother.
We shall certainly move
to Varnavrat, Purochan.
Is that true, Crown Prince?
Indeed.
You are too kind, Crown Prince.
I am certain
that if you perform
a veneration in Varnavrat
the soul of the late King Pandu
will be contented.
We are also certain
of that, Purochan.
On behalf of the kingdom,
the subjects of Varnavrat
will be given money as charity
by mother.
Have this news
announced as well.
As you say, Crown Prince.
Now, allow us to leave.
Allow us to leave, Her Highness.
Why did you decide
to go to Varnavrat
all of a sudden, Yudhishthir?
Mother, be it a person
or situation
staying near them makes one
realize their demerits
while staying away,
makes one realize their merits.
I wish to test the merits
and demerits of Hastinapur.
I am close to it now
but I wish to go away
for a while.
That way I will be able
to compare the two.
Purochan.
Greetings, King of Gandhar.
What did that Kunti say?
Not Her Highness
but Crown Prince Yudhishthir
has given the answer,
King of Gandhar.
And very soon, they will
proceed to Varnavrat.
Splendid!
Absolutely marvellous!
Insects that fly often jump
into the fire themselves.
We merely have to start a fire.
This is called an ideal time.
This plan is based
entirely on you, Purochan.
If you succeed,
your future generations
will never have to
engage in labour
for I will make you
a filthy rich man.
However, if you fail
then your future generations
won't be able to engage in
labour for they won't be born.
You need not worry,
King of Gandhar.
Things will go
as you have planned.
I have brought this vessel
for Prince Duryodhan.
Place it there.
Now, you need to go to Varnavrat
to welcome the Pandavas.
When the time is right,
my messenger will come
to you bearing the order
from me.
As you say, King of Gandhar.
Goodbye.
Leave.
Beloved Yudhishthir
were you not going to reconsider
going to Varnavrat?
Greetings, uncle.
I have meditated over it.
A veneration is
being held in Varnavrat
in father's memory.
I think, it is not only
important for us to go there
but also appropriate.
- But why?
When it is time to curtail
Duryodhan's unpleasant deeds
will your going away from
Hastinapur be appropriate?
If I stay here, everyday
Duryodhan will hatch
a new scheme.
Then what's the point,
Yudhishthir?
When you shall return
he will begin scheming again.
No, uncle.
If water is
contaminated with soil
stirring the water
does not purify it.
If given some time, the soil
settles down on its own.
I am absolutely certain
that Duryodhan's
agitated mind will
settle down with time.
- Just think about it.
Suddenly, after such a long time
why did subjects of Varnavrat
think of brother Pandu?
Before this, no veneration
was ever held in his memory.
Brother Pandu going to Varnavrat
in his lifetime
is also not something
I can recollect.
Do you not find this odd?
I have meditated over it, uncle.
If we do face any trouble
in Varnavrat
my brothers and I will be
able to handle it.
But in Hastinapur, our hearts
are always troubled, uncle.
One needs valour to battle
external troubles, uncle.
But a troubled heart
can be pacified
only by hardening it.
But acting heartlessly
with my cousins
is not something
I will be able to do.
North-West, North,
North-East, East.
Dwaraka.
Be careful.
Do not step on that.
Do not step on
those illusory circles
else you will land
in the Netherworld.
You dance quite well.
Did I not tell you?
Wait, let me come to you.
Be careful.
I have dug holes in the ground
and covered them with a carpet.
This exercise is done
to strengthen one's memory.
But, apart from
your brother Krishna
you will not believe anyone.
Do you still doubt
brother Krishna?
No.
I doubted him before I met him
but
now, I doubt myself.
So, what brings you here?
There is a message for you
from Hastinapur.
Where is Madhav?
I need to seek
his permission to leave.
So, are you going back
to Hastinapur?
No, not to Hastinapur.
Brother Yudhishthir has asked me
to proceed to Varnavrat at once.
But you hardly stayed
in Dwaraka.
The wise men of Dwaraka say
where there is Krishna,
there is Dwaraka.
And a friend resides
in the heart.
If you see it from this angle,
Dwaraka is right here.
So, what's the point
of staying in this Dwaraka?
I must follow brother
Yudhishthir's order and leave.
Allow me to leave.
It is time now, dear.
I have heard the news
that very soon Arjun
will reach Varnavrat.
In the palace of Varnavrat
the five enemies of ours
will assemble.
In that very palace
will be held the 'Yuvrajasuya Yajna' for you.
*Young (yuv) king imperial burning sacrifice.
Yuvrajasuya Yajna?
When a King
proves his competence
he conducts a 'Rajasuya Yajna,
King of Anga.
Beloved Duryodhan
is about to prove his competence
as the Crown Prince.
Hence, he will conduct
a 'Yuvrajasuya Yajna.
What do you mean?
In Varnavrat, Purochan has
constructed a palace
not with bricks, stones
and binding agent
but lac
cotton
animal flesh
clarified butter
and dried grass.
He has constructed it with
various inflammable items.
This is 'Lakshagraha!' 'Lakshagraha!'*
*House of lac.
This is 'Lakshagraha.
A 'yajna' will be
conducted there. A 'yajna!
And in that 'yajna
that palace will be used
as the sacrifice, friend.
And my enemies
will burn to ashes
in that 'yajna!
A person who is
blind since birth
is unworthy
of becoming the king.
When all the sons
are equally worthy
only then does the eldest son
have this right, Queen Mother.
My lord..
Avoid!
I said, avoid!
Right now, I am not in a state
to converse with anyone.
Today my decision
to blindfold my eyes
seems worth it.
The world that does such
injustice to my husband
is unworthy to be looked at.
Pardon me, Prince.
The ministers of the court
have decided
that they will..
- Coronate Pandu as the king.
I knew it.
I am sure, he must have
been ecstatic. Am I right?
Who could be happy
at this decision, Queen Mother?
This will fill
my entire life with grief.
Grandsire
I am but a servant
to my elder brother
and for a servant,
his duties are his ornaments.
I have taken an oath to serve
my brother since birth.
I can take his side
not his place.
Something that inflicts a wound
and then applies an ointment
of words on it is politics.
I had no idea
when he learnt all this.
Pandu..
Then grandsire must have said
that keeping the pain
and dejection of oneself
locked up in one's heart
and carrying out one's duties
is the duty of every prince.
And you must bear this duty
on your shoulders.
A person can never be
greater than the throne
and love
can never be
greater than duties.
If through meditation,
rituals or medication
we could coronate
Dhritarashtra as the king
then we would have
gladly waited for it
but the situation is not so.
Dhritarashtra will
never be able to see.
That is why
in the best interest
of the entire Kingdom of Kuru
the responsibility
of this kingdom
falls to you.
Only after
everyone requested him
did Prince Pandu
say in the royal court
that during
the exile of Lord Ram
Bharat had carried out
the duties of the throne
similarly, he too would
carry out the royal duties.
So, have you come here
to take my slippers, soldier?
Will Pandu place them on
the throne and sit at its base?
What is the point of this act?
Even Lord Ram had been
exiled for 14 years
but in my case
everyone has sentenced me
to a lifelong exile.
A lifelong exile.
He is not Bharat.
He will not give up
the throne for anyone.
Neither will he
give it up for me
nor for my children.
Now, the Kuru dynasty
will be furthered by Pandu.
Now, the future
of blind Dhritarashtra
will be in darkness.
In darkness.
I have been tied
to this darkness forever
by that Pandu.
That Pandu has
tied me to it forever.
Son Shakuni.
Son, is time for us to leave.
I too was thinking
of this, mother.
Get up, Chandal!
Get up, dear Pishaach!
It is the order of my father.
We must leave.
Let's go.
Now, Gandhari's..
Now, Gandhari's
silent sacrifice..
Come on.
Pardon me, mother.
My dice refuse to budge.
Why are you joking, Shakuni?
- It's no joke, Your Highness.
Leave.
I am not joking, Your Highness.
I explained it
to the two of them
that we must return to Gandhar
but these two..
Shame is keeping them
from getting up, sire.
Isn't the name
of our ancestral kingdom
Purushpura, father?
But if you and l,
a king and a prince
return to Gandhar with
such an insult to our chivalry
then what will we
tell our subjects?
Shall we call
the 'land of men
the 'land of eunuchs'?
This is what these impudent
fellows here say, father.
This is what they say.
Our insult?
Who insulted us, Shakuni?
This was Gandhari's fate.
- Fate!
Fate!
If fate cannot be trusted like
a gamble, father
then I will not side with fate
but with a gamble!
With a gamble!
At least before they
fall to the ground
these dice are in my hand.
I throw them in the air.
No one throws them
on my behalf, father.
But you have given
the dice of our lives
in the hands of that Bhishma,
father.
In the hands of that Bhishma.
That is why we have been
treated so poorly.
Gandhari has met with
great injustice, father.
She has met with injustice
and this truth is
piercing my heart
like a dagger, father.
Piercing my heart
like a dagger!
Shakuni!
Son..
Son, what have you done?
How can anyone stab oneself
with a dagger, son?
What have you done?
Father
this wound will remind me
of the great injustice
done to Gandhari.
You may proceed towards Gandhar.
I shall stay right here
in Hastinapur.
And until
I make dear Gandhari
the Queen of the Kuru dynasty
the Kuru dynasty will not
experience an iota of happiness
because
I won't allow it.
They won't experience
an iota of happiness
because I won't allow it!
When one deems
an incident to be unjust
then that incident
shakes up his psyche.
The entire world seems
like an enemy to him.
The greater the intensity of
the incident that seems unjust
the greater is the protest done
by the heart of man.
In reply to that incident,
he asks for justice.
And this is apt.
In reality, any form
of injustice in the society
destroys the belief and faith
of a person.
But
what is justice?
What does justice mean?
The one who was unjust
ought to repent
and the one
who experienced injustice
ought to renew faith
in his heart about society.
Does this not sum up
the meaning of justice?
But an unrighteous person
renounces justice and
embraces enmity and revenge.
He chooses to defeat violence
with violence.
The one who experienced agony
tries to inflict
greater agony to others.
And while walking down
this path, the oppressed
becomes the oppressor.
Very soon
he turns into a criminal.
In other words
there is very little difference
between justice and revenge
and this difference is called
righteousness.
Is it not true?
Think about it.
Your Highness!
Give me this sword.
That is
the difference
between you
and Prince Pandu.
You may raise your sword
but you never wound anyone.
But Prince Pandu's sword
wounds people
even without being raised.
Prince Shakuni
I could not recognise
your footfalls today.
That is because, Your Highness
henceforth I have
changed my way of walking.
Change your path along with your
way of walking too, Shakuni.
Gandhar awaits you.
I have left Gandhar behind me,
Your Highness.
Now my path will follow you.
I have changed my path.
That is why I have changed
my way of walking too.
My path does not
lead anywhere anymore.
My path has been obstructed
forever.
If one ties your feet
then one can dampen
only your speed
but cannot divert you from
your path, King Dhritarashtra.
Stop mocking me by referring
to me as the king, Shakuni.
The king of Hastinapur
is that Pandu now.
King..
The sun does not rise during
the night, Your Highness.
Then shall we stop
calling it the sun?
When it is day,
the sun rises for sure.
You are the sun of Hastinapur.
The throne of Hastinapur
had always been yours
is yours and will always be so.
When the time is ripe
you shall have your right.
And how is that?
I do not know right now
but I have faith in time.
Time always bestows us
with opportunities
and the one who makes
the most of an opportunity
is the victorious one.
Will you teach me deception now?
That too against my own family?
What family are you talking
about, King Dhritarashtra?
The family
that snatched your right
from you?
I have to agree,
Your Highness.
You are very generous
but in politics,
the other name of generosity
is foolishness.
- Shakuni!
I shall behead you
for this impudence of yours.
Then do so, Your Highness.
Then do so.
My beloved sister's heart
has already been
broken into bits by you.
Now you may chop my body
into many pieces as well.
Just for once think about it.
Just once.
When you had returned dejected
from Hastinapur's royal court
then to bear your
dejection and rage
my beloved Gandhari
was standing right before you
and not your family,
Your Highness.
We are folks of the mountain,
Your Highness.
The way a mountain
gives away all its water
and keeps nothing for itself.
Similarly we too give away
all our love.
But my beloved sister's
love and dedication
could not be recognised
by you, Your Highness.
Only with her
will you find both happiness
and strength.
Strength?
How can a woman
bestow me with strength?
Woman?
Woman!
Ravan had only 20 arms
and with them he had
picked up Mount Kailash.
My beloved sister
can give you 200 arms.
200 arms.
With them you can lift
not only Hastinapur
but also
the entire region of Arya.
The entire region of Arya,
King Dhritarashtra.
Goodbye.
Grandsire.
What's the penalty for going
against a king's order?
Who has committed the of fence
is also significant
to be considered.
What's the significance
in that, grandsire?
It's enough to know
that the of fence
has been committed!
Tell me!
What's the punishment
for opposing a king's order?
Sometimes,
to save a person's life
the physician amputates
that person's limb.
But that doesn't make him
an enemy.
He is not punished.
Instead, he is rewarded.
What Kunti did
at the entrance
was correct.
She stopped the rise
of a protest in the kingdom.
I've heard the discussions
amongst the subjects
in the kingdom,
grandsire!
Everyone was saying,
if the king's command
was very difficult to follow
then seek refuge
with the mother queen.
Father, now
no one's afraid of the king.
So, what's inefficient
about it, son?
The king's duty is not to spread
fear among his subjects.
His duty is to protect
his subjects
from all their fear in life.
Then, why is father
crowned the king, mother?
Let Lady Kunti sit
on the throne.
Lady Kunti will rule the kingdom
taking advice from her sons.
This means, even Hastinapur
will now be ruled
as per
brother Yudishthir's wish.
Then how does division
of kingdoms hold good?
What do you wish, dear?
I want Lady Kunti
to be rightly punished.
That would be sheer foolishness,
son.
The Pandavas will avenge
their mother's insult.
Do you wish to see a war?
They can never
fight a battle, mother.
They don't have the liberty
to fight a battle.
Their flag isn't going to be
hoisted in that kingdom, mother.
Only Hastinapur's flag
will fly high.
How will they fight a battle?
Grandsire,
please take the decision.
I...
I serve this kingdom.
The king will take
the decision, Your Ladyship.
I have only one boon
that my father had given me.
The boon to decide
the time of my death.
I don't have any other boon,
Your Ladyship.
Grandsire.
Grandsire, please don't
speak sorrowfully.
I accept your advice.
Kunti won't be punished, son.
But, Gandhari,
it's also necessary
to stop the subjects
of Hastinapur
from setting
towards Indraprastha.
Hence, I've decided
that not just the subjects
but even the royal family
shall not take part
in the inaugural ceremony
of the kingdom.
Inform Kunti
regarding the same.
Dear!
Dear
you cannot be unjust.
A mother lives with only
one hope in life.
To see her sons
obtain happiness and success.
Today when Kunti's sons
are going to achieve
such a huge success
how can we snatch away
this opportunity to witness
this success from Kunti?
I know that, Gandhari.
I'm extremely contrite
about it.
But the thread
that holds the pearls together
has to remain hidden as it is
the base of those pearls.
Similarly, a sacrifice
has to be made
by the royal family first.
Because it is the base
of the subjects.
Kunti shall not
go to Indraprastha.
This is my firm decision.
God bless you!
God bless you,
King of Anga.
You're a generous
and capable Arya.
I'm not a generous person, sage.
I give alms only because
my father has said
that there's nothing superior
than giving alms.
Giving alms purifies the soul.
Unfortunately
certain events
keep occurring in my life
that makes my soul impure.
God bless you!
Vrushali.
You're here!
Accept my apology,
Your Majesty.
I'm here to make a request
to you.
There was a time when my house
was adjacent to yours.
Considering that relationship
if you can be kind enough...
- Yes, continue.
What is it?
Ask the crown prince to allow me
to meet my father.
The crown prince is your friend,
isn't he?
But aren't you going
to Indraprastha
with Queen Mother?
The king has prohibited
Queen Mother
from going to Indraprastha.
She can't attend the inaugural
ceremony of Indraprastha.
That's impossible!
Such grave unrighteousness!
The crown prince can't
be so immoral.
I...
I must talk to him.
You may go, Vrushali.
Don't worry.
You shall definitely go
to Indraprastha.
Very soon.
This is my promise to you.
Victory!
Karna, my friend!
Welcome, dear friend.
You've displayed
great resolve and capability
in front of the subjects today.
I'm extremely elated.
If I weren't the reason
for your happiness today
I would have been
very happy, friend.
To get
the credit of unrighteousness
is not a matter to rejoice.
Unrighteousness?
What's the reason behind
your statement?
Which unrighteousness
has taken place today?
To hold someone's mother
as captive
and to avenge her sons
is unrighteousness, my friend.
To hold someone's mother
as captive
and to avenge her sons
is unrighteousness, my friend.
That unrighteousness
is visible to you, friend.
But didn't you see
the immorality
that was inflicted upon me?
- Definitely, yes.
I'm ready to fight
with the entire world for that.
But, friend, even when the king
mounts an elephant
he mounts on its back,
not on its head.
The elephant's head
is always virtuous
because it's similar to Lord Ganesh's* head.
*Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom.
The enemy's mother
is equally virtuous, my friend.
I understand
your predicament, friend.
But this is politics.
We build castles for protection,
don't we?
Consider Lady Kunti
as one of the castles, friend.
The bricks used to build castles
don't have a heart.
A mother's heart weeps.
And the fire that arises
from this faintheartedness
burns all the happiness
to ashes, friend.
You had attempted to burn
Lady Kunti alive in Varnavrat.
That was highly iniquitous.
Fortunately, she was alive.
Now
don't separate Lady Kunti
from her sons, friend.
My friend
why are you advocating
on behalf of the enemies today?
It's because enmity
is sustained with warriors.
May the woman, child, cow
or a rustic farm
belong to any country.
Causing harm to them
is considered unacceptable.
Whose side are you on, Karna?
Did you forget that I had
made you the king of Anga?
When you were being insulted
in front of everyone
it was me who had given you
the respect and right.
I remember that, my friend.
Therefore, I've taken the oath
to protect you all my life.
P rote ct!
Is this how you
will protect me?
I'm trying to protect you
from being wrongful, friend.
I sense unfaithfulness
in your words, Karna.
I have a feeling
that even you wish to reside
in Indraprastha now.
You are inferior before Arjun.
So, now you wish to establish
your glory in the world
with his support.
You've hurled such a grave
accusation on me, friend!
Since you have doubts
on my intentions
I shall take an oath today
that however the situation
pertains to be
I shall never plead
with Arjun for my life.
Neither shall I provide him
the gift of life.
Now, do you believe
my faithfulness?
Kindly release Lady Kunti
from captivity.
Impossible!
Children!
King of Anga...
Dear King!
A kingdom can't be ruled
only on the basis of the
principles of righteousness.
You're a king.
You must support
unrighteous deeds at times
as well as
be unrighteous at times.
If that's how it is...
If that's how it is
then please permit to remove
this crown, Prince.
Prince, today I feel
that you're avenging
the injustice done to you
by committing
this act of immorality.
You have the right to do so.
But if I support you in this act
then, perhaps
it's the greed for this crown
that would make me do it.
But, I...
I'll not be able to survive
under this burden.
I...
I don't wish to become
the king of Anga.
I want to become
a commoner, friend.
Please forgive me.
Are you giving me this
in return of my favours?
Charioteer's son!
Please don't be indignant,
my friend.
I shall forever be your armour.
At your single command
I shall accept
a hundred deaths.
But to serve you
it's not important for me
to remain a king.
I'm not contended
with your answer.
I'm contended.
I'm contended with the answer.
My dear,
if Karna doesn't wish
it's not right
to forcefully stop him.
Not the king of Anga
but the great charioteer, Karna.
You're just tied
to the bond of friendship.
You're free from the burden
of ruling the kingdom.
I'm grateful to you
for your kindness.
King of Gandhar.
May I make a request
for one last time?
Of course,
the great charioteer Karna!
Kindly allow Vrushali
to go to Indraprastha.
I had promised her
depending on my friendship.
And that promise would certainly
be fulfilled, Karna.
The girl is free to go,
charioteer.
I shall take the king's fury.
You may go.
Greetings!
- Greetings!
Uncle!
- My dear
the sword is sharpened
before the battle.
Everyday,
if you sharpen the sword
it will become so brittle
that it will break
during the battle.
If your friend continued
to preach about unrighteousness
he shall very soon
lose his capability as well.
Their powers had been snatched
through treachery in this court.
Return their powers to them.
That will be sufficient.
Yes! Of course!
I return the property
and the kingdom of the Pandavas
right at this moment.
Impossible!
You have no right to give
away my property, father.
Duryodhan...
Keep quiet,
foolish Prince!
Have mercy on Hastinapur.
Stay quiet.
Stay quiet!
I would have surely done so.
Let us assume
that the entire game
was based on dishonesty
and deceit.
You must also admit
that you have quietly
allowed this dishonesty
and deceit to take place.
Even you admit that all of you
are to blame as much as I am.
Admit it!
If this game...
The rules of this game
were drafted
by grandsire Bhishma
and both the parties
had adhered to the rules.
If the game
was unlawful
then, all of you
are the culprits.
If not, then even
I am blameless.
Is there anyone
present at this court
who can say
that this game
was based on dishonesty
and deceit?
Is there any such person?
Silence still reigns
in the court.
Is no one still doubtful
about their conscience?
Do all of you not know
that the silence
of a pious person
is considered a greater crime
that the words
of an evil person?
Remember this,
knowledgeable ones...
Duryodhan will definitely
be punished for his sins.
But before that
all the people
present at this court
will be punished
for staying silent.
This is a curse
by Draupadi, the one born
from a sacrificial fire.
Mankind has always
subjected women
to exploitation, injustice
and humiliation.
Look around yourself.
Look at all of history.
That's all you will see.
Men's jealousy, lust,
pride, enmity...
Women suffer
the consequences
of all these negative emotions.
Men indulge in battle
but the women of the defeated
kingdoms are tormented.
Men lose their property
while drinking and gambling.
And women?
Women are destined to starve.
Men, overcome
by their pride
restrict women's freedom,
ruin their happiness.
Men get defeated
at the hands of life
and give up their families.
And women?
Women keep struggling
to feed
their small children.
Count all the sufferings
in this universe.
It will be very apparent
that compared to men,
women suffer much more.
What kind of a society
have we created?
Wherein, one half of mankind
relentlessly
exploits the other half.
And those exploited women
give birth to the next
generation of mankind.
Look at the nature.
Those seeds which give birth
to new plants
are surrounded by petals.
They are surrounded
by colour and perfume.
The place where the future
is conceived
should be surrounded
only by beauty, happiness
contentment and respect.
Is that not so?
But by making women suffer
the society makes
the future generations suffer.
Torture, exploitation, pain...
After experiencing such torment
how can women give birth
to happy and healthy progeny?
Hence
whenever any woman
is humiliated
exploited
whenever a woman's hair
is pulled
in some form or the other
the seed of a battle is sown.
In some form or the other,
an epic
begins.
Judge for yourselves.
Do so again and again.
Your Highness
your decision to return
the Pandavas' property
their kingdom
their weapons
and their freedom
to them, is right.
But even Duryodhan's objection
is justified, Your Highness.
Thus,
I propose a compromise.
If your courtiers permit me
I will tell you about it.
Well?
Tell me quickly.
What is it?
Your Highness
for 13 years, Duryodhan
can claim ownership
of all that he has won.
As a result of their defeat
the Pandavas will spend 13 years
in exile, in the forest.
And when they return from exile
their property
and their kingdom
will be returned to them,
with due respect.
Uncle!
I am right, my child.
I am right!
If you are still not satisfied
then let us
sentence the Pandavas
to 12 years of exile
and 1 year of hiding.
If the Pandavas
are recognised in the last year
then once again
they will have to go through
12 years of exile
and 1 year of hiding.
Now
do not be too greedy,
my child.
I accept this solution.
If the Pandavas 
are recognised
in the last year
then once again
they will have to go through
12 years of exile
and 1 year of hiding.
Now
do not be too greedy,
my child.
I accept this solution.
Wonderful!
What's the opinion
of the Pandavas? - Uncle!
These Pandavas
are still my slaves.
My decision will be
the ultimate one.
Don't you make that mistake,
Duryodhan.
The curse of a tormented soul
never goes in vain.
You might be afraid of that,
grandsire...
You are going to be punished
for your principles.
I am not.
Father!
I will not free my slaves
or return their property.
But if you command me
I am ready to accept
the compromise
proposed by uncle.
Along with Draupadi
these five Pandavas
will have to stay in exile
in the forest, for 12 years.
In these 12 years
they can't become the allies
of any king
enjoy their hospitality
or build an army.
Which means
that in these 12 years,
these Pandavas
won't be free.
At the end of the exile,
all of them
will have to stay
in complete hiding for a year.
If, in that one year
I see any of the five Pandavas
or their wife
then once again,
they will have
to live in exile
for another 12 years.
So, tell me, father.
What is your decision?
Forgive me, sons of Pandu.
But as per the tradition,
you were the ones
who lost yourselves
to Duryodhan.
Thus...
Thus
I have to accept
Duryodhan's proposal.
I command you.
You five brothers,
along with your wife Draupadi
will have to go through
12 years of exile in the forest
and one year of hiding.
You have to accept it.
As you wish, uncle.
Please permit us
to visit Indraprastha
to meet our subjects
and make certain arrangements.
Permission granted.
We are grateful
to all of you, uncle.
We're taking your leave
for the last time.
After 13 years,
when the Pandavas return
we'll snatch
what's rightfully ours.
This court has introduced us
to the power of dishonesty.
We will make
this very court realise
the power of honesty.
Before I leave,
hear my oath, everyone.
I will tear open Dushashan's
chest and drink his blood!
The death of all the sons
of King Dhritarashtra
will be by my hands.
This the beginning of the end,
King Dhritarashtra.
In this court
everyone who witnessed
the deceit we were subjected to
along with Panchali's
humiliation
yet remained silent
will have to die.
Rivers will turn red with blood
there will be mountains
of severed heads
there will be a catastrophe!
There will be a great battle.
The greatest battle
in the history of mankind!
Prince Arjun.
Govind was correct.
Mahadev always gives
a definite answer.
In the 'swayamvar,
that competition
shall await you.
This 'swayamvar' is only
for 'Kshatriya' Kings, Nakul.
We have disguised as 'Brahmins.
No one will await us there.
We must follow mother's orders
and leave for Naimisharanya
tonight itself.
You shall indeed come
to the 'swayamvar,' Prince.
I have firm faith in it.
That is why, Govind had said
that fate does not
require an invitation.
Listen all!
The Crown Prince
of Vidarbha, Rukmi
is making his entrance!
Listen all!
The Crown Prince of Hastinapur
the son of King Dhritarashtra
Duryodhan, is making
his entrance!
Listen all!
King Karna of Anga
is making his entrance!
Listen all!
The King of Gandhar,
esteemed Brahmin
Pratipal Shakuni
is making his entrance!
Listen all!
The Prince of Hastinapur,
Dusshasan
is making his entrance!
The arrangements look splendid,
King of Gandhar.
And the place has also
been adorned beautifully.
What happens when spring
graces a desert, King of Anga?
One gets to see mirages then.
You still deem Panchal an enemy,
King of Gandhar.
But if an enemy is praiseworthy
brave men praise such an enemy.
You deem bravery to be victory.
I deem victory to be bravery,
King of Anga.
The benevolence
to praise the enemy
does not reside in me.
But guru Drona has befriended
the King of Panchal, uncle.
Now, the King of Panchal
is our friend.
Until proven one's enemy
one who deems
everyone his friends
is a fool.
And until proven one's friend
one who deems
everyone his enemies
is intelligent, my dear!
Drupad is still our enemy.
If he is intelligent
and wishes to
befriend Hastinapur
then he will have
his daughter married
only to my Duryodhan.
Draupadi
Guru Mother is here to have
your hair tied ritualistically.
Why is there a ritual
to tie the hair?
Princess
after marriage women do not
leave their hair open.
Only women who have
lost their husbands
leave their hair open.
I shall tie your hair after
applying this special oil.
Then your husband will
put a hair ornament on it.
Pray for me.
Pray for such a person
to win the 'swayamvar
whose face would leave
the heart feeling ecstatic.
This place is empty, mother.
And it is also safe.
Son, are we far from Kampilya?
Yes, mother.
Very far.
Do go inside and rest.
We shall then proceed
towards Naimisharanya.
We shall not be able to rest
properly for days then.
And we may also not get
a proper meal for days.
Between this place
and Naimisharanya
is there not a big village
or city, brother Yudhishthir?
No, Bheem.
We must ask for alms
from a nearby village.
You and Nakul
must stay with mother.
The three of us
will get the alms.
No.
If the five of you go together
then you will be able
to get the alms sooner.
But mother
you will be alone here.
What should I fear, son?
I shall close the door.
I shall complete an undertaking
I had made a resolution for.
All of you should go now
but return soon.
Goodbye, mother.
In which direction should we
proceed, brother Yudhishthir?
Kampilya lies
towards North, Arjun.
We cannot proceed that way.
We should proceed
in this direction.
There must be a village
this way.
But will anyone be here?
What if everyone has gone
to see the 'swayamvar?
Why would everyone go
to see the 'swayamvar?
I've heard, the King of Panchal
has organized a grand event.
And whoever goes there today
will be given
gold coins in charity.
Such an announcement
was also made by him.
And the subjects also wish
to see their Princess, brother.
I have heard that the
Princess is so beautiful
that upon seeing her,
one forgets one's woes.
Many Princes would
have gone there then
with the hope
to forget their woes.
All hail King Drupad!
All hail King Drupad!
All hail King Drupad!
All hail King Drupad!
All hail King Drupad!
All hail King Drupad!
All hail King Drupad!
Bless you all!
I welcome all the Kings
and Princes present here.
All of you must know
that the whole
of the Aryan region
was given a divine present
by the Gods.
From the sacrificial fire
a daughter as pure and radiant
as fire and bearing
divine beauty
was created.
She is like a flag at
the pinnacle of a temple
or at the zenith of a palace!
Similarly, to have my daughter
the Princess of Panchal,
Draupadi
as his wife would be the fortune
of only the most competent
person on the planet!
I ask the 'Kshatriya
Kings and
Princes present
to have their competence tested
by coming forth!
Crown Prince Dhrishtadyumna
shall elaborate upon
the competition.
I welcome the guests
present here!
Such a device has
been set up here
which cannot be conquered
by an ordinary warrior.
This divine bow
can be lifted only by a person
who has nothing but confidence
in his competence.
If the shadow of doubt
creeps up on someone
then for him,
the weight of this bow
will be more than
that of a mountain.
This bow can be stringed
only by a person
who can free himself
of desire, anger and greed
and knows how to bear it.
To him, art should not be
a medium to obtain anything
but an opportunity to
further learn various arts.
Kings and Princes present here
do you see that fish
revolving in the sky?
Its eye is your goal.
The fish shown here was made
using computer graphics.
By looking at its reflection
in the water
the archer needs to
pierce its eye
with
only one arrow.
And the person
who wins this competition
will be married
to my beloved sister.
My dear, can you do it?
No, uncle.
I am not a proficient archer.
And uncle
no woman can be
important enough
for whom I shall
have to bear insult.
My dear
not Draupadi
but the relationship
with Panchal is important.
You know quite well
that Gandhar, Anga Pradesh,
Hastinapur
and even Ashwatthama's
half of Panchal
is on our side.
If Drupad's half of Panchal
also comes to our side
then very soon
you may become the master
of the entire Aryan region.
I cannot do it, uncle!
No one can win this competition.
This is not a 'swayamvar
but a scheme to insult
all the Kings.
If they were truly looking
for a competent warrior
then they would also have
organized a fight with maces
and the ones involving
swords and spears too!
Who, in the whole
of the Aryan region
can win this competition?
I can win it, friend.
Had this competition not been
a part of a 'swayamvar
I would have achieved this feat.
But you can still win
the competition, King of Anga.
No, King of Gandhar.
The rank of the son-in-law
of a big kingdom like Panchal
lies above that of
Crown Prince Duryodhan
and I cannot permit it.
But you can certainly transfer
the benefit of your victory
to your friend, King of Anga.
You must win the competition
on behalf of Duryodhan
and have him married
to the Princess.
But would it be correct?
Would winning a wife
for someone else
be appropriate?
Correct...
Why not?
The son of Ganga, Bhishma
has done this all his life.
If Duryodhan permits you
then you may take part
in the competition.
I give you the permission,
friend King of Anga.
You must indeed
win this maiden for me.
As you say, friend.
I shall take part
in this competition.
When the Almighty himself
is the charioteer
and justice and righteousness
are the wheels of that chariot
the flag atop it
shall always be blessed by me.
May you be victorious.
There is another
basis of might, Bheem.
And that is
a tail
which you do not have.
I am on my way,
Duryodhan
with the might of Lord Hanuman,
son of Pavan Dev, in my arms.
I am on my way!
Splendid, my darling!
Splendid! - Uncle!
Brother! I have some bad news,
brother Duryodhan!
I have heard from various sages
that Bheem has pleased
Lord Hanuman!
And being pleased with him,
Lord Hanuman
has provided him with His might,
brother Duryodhan.
I do not fear Bheem one bit!
I do not!
My darling!
I have heard that Arjun seeks
to acquire the Pashupatastra
brother Duryodhan.
And the Pandavas are gathering
an army of competent people.
The Pandavas
will engage in a battle
only when they are successful
in their life of anonymity.
At the dawn
of their life of anonymity
the Pandavas
will be standing before us
and we shall
send them back on an exile.
Uncle, why would the Pandavas
come and stand before us?
To protect their wife.
If you lift a trident
by its shaft
then the three of its prongs
come along with it.
Just a day before
their life of anonymity begins
Draupadi will be
abducted by us!
The method to heal
the wounds of our army quickly
was taught to us
by the Ashwini Kumaras.
And not only that.
They also taught us how
to heal horses and elephants.
When the battle comes
to a halt at sunset
the soldiers who are wounded
will not die
because of the wounds.
We shall heal them
by the crack of dawn.
After pleasing Lord Shiva,
when Arjun
will acquire the Pashupatastra
we will never get defeated
by grandsire and guru Drona.
Panchali, all the sages
and guests
have left after having a meal.
I hope you have kept
food aside for yourself.
There is sufficient
food for me, My Lord.
I have set aside
extra food for you.
Enough"
I do not want more.
If it is too much for you
then let me have some.
Panchali
you should begin
your meal as well.
This is enough for all of us.
Yes, Panchali.
Let me serve
the entire contents of this pot
on your plate.
If it is too much for you,
you may give me some.
Is there a householder
in this hut
who can give a meal to us sages
or has the entire world
fallen prey to unrighteousness?!
Great sage Durvasa!
Greetings!
Welcome.
- Prince
sweet talk does not
satiate a person.
Since you are a householder now
you must provide
us sages with a meal.
My disciples and I shall
have a meal at your residence.
Princes, arrange for
a place to sit for us
and you
must tell your wife
to arrange for a meal for us.
As you say,
great sage.
Bheem, Sahadev, arrange for
a place to sit for the sages.
Nakul, go and place clean
plantain leaves for the meal.
Let me go aid Panchali.
Alright.
Great sage Durvasa is here!
At this time?
- Panchali, guests
always arrive unannounced.
We must offer them a meal.
Vasudev made us take a vow
to ensure that sages
leave this place contented
so that we can earn merit.
Upon hearing of this vow
of ours, great sage Durvasa
must have come here to test us.
But all the food that we had
has already been
served by me, My Lord.
I even served food on my plate.
Now, how can we serve him a
meal which was intended for us?
That amount would not have
sufficed anyhow, Panchali.
More than 100 disciples have
accompanied the great sage.
You must prepare something.
I do not even have
enough grains with me
that I can prepare
something, My Lord.
The one who takes a test
comes with the intention
of leaving discontented.
No one can ever make the tester
leave feeling utterly contented.
And everyone is familiar with
the wrath of great sage Durvasa.
If he is not contented
then he will certainly curse us.
How will we ever be able
to give him a satisfactory meal?
Prince!
- Yes?
Tell the daughter of Drupad
that after being seated
for a meal, great sage Durvasa
does not have
the habit of waiting.
Tell her to serve
our meaIs this instant
otherwise we shall leave
on an empty stomach.
Such a situation
will never arise, great sage.
Your meal will be here
in just a while.
Do not interrupt me,
impudent man!
Tell her
that if great sage Durvasa
is not contented
then the future of the Pandavas
will get incinerated
with his wrath!
What do I offer
great sage Durvasa now?
What do I do now?
The curse of great sage Durvasa
has the power to turn all our
plans upside down, My Lord.
What will become of us now?
Disciple...
I do not think we will get
a meal from this residence.
Let's leave!
No, great sage.
No.
Just wait for
a little while longer.
Panchali!
Brother Yudhishthir,
the great sage is very angry.
He is about to leave
on an empty stomach.
The duties of a householder have
been tarnished by Pandu's sons!
I cannot wait any longer.
Let's leave!
Just a little while longer,
great sage.
Just wait for
a little while longer.
Insolent men!
Do you not know
that the longer hunger
and the enemies wait
the stronger they get?!
They become more powerful!
Get up!
Patience and herbs
become weaker
with the passage of time!
And listen!
I shall wait only until I am
done reciting the Gayatri Mantra
101 times and
not a moment longer!
Not a moment longer!
Why is he testing us
in this manner?
This exile is a time of tests
for all of us, Panchali.
In order to help us
know our limits
the Almighty has blessed us with
this opportunity of an exile.
I have realized what
my limits are, My Lord.
I lack in providing nourishment.
I shall go to the great sage
and apologize for this.
Stop, Panchali.
If the great sage
vents his anger out on you
then it would be a defeat
for us five brothers.
Wait here.
I shall go tell him.
- Stop, Sahadev.
Panchali lacking grains
in her kitchen
denotes my limit.
You need not worry,
Panchali.
Ensuring that one has enough
grains for a guest at home
is the duty of a householder.
It is my defeat
as a householder.
That is why, I must
apologize to the great sage.
Whenever one undergoes a test
there is always a way
to succeed in it.
How do I succeed in this?
How are you,
friend?
Are you happy?
Govind!
How do you do it,
Govind?
Whenever I require your aid
you always come to me.
Aid!
This is a deliberate attempt
on your part, friend.
Whenever I come visit all of you
you always make me do
some task or the other.
What seems to be the problem?
Great sage Durvasa
and his disciples
have come over for a meal
but there is no food
in any of the vessels.
Let me think of a way
to make the great sage
understand.
This is a grave problem.
A grain of rice
is still there, friend.
However, this single
grain of rice
would not leave
those sages contented.
Am I correct?
How would it,
Govind?
I think great sage Durvasa
is almost done
reciting the mantra as well.
Govind, I will have to serve him
and the 100 disciples of his
a meal very soon.
In such a situation
saving this single grain
for them is of no use.
Let me have it.
Om Bhur Bhuvah...
Prince Bheem!
I am certain that the
treacherous Vasudev Krishna
is inside your hut.
Pardon me,
great sage Durvasa.
Why have I done,
great sage?
Why have I done,
great sage?
You are an illusory being,
Vasudev
but the person
you have sided with
is on the side of righteousness
and there is no doubt about it.
And
the daughter of Drupad
we are leaving your home
feeling contented.
You have
truly been blessed by Goddess Annapurna.*
*Annapurna Devi: the goddess of nourishment.
You are too kind,
great sage.
Great sage Durvasa
and his disciples
burped as though
they had just eaten.
The courage to cast an illusion
on great sage Durvasa
can reside only
within you, Vasudev.
What did I do?
The son of Pavan Dev,
Lord Hanuman
was pleased by brother Bheem.
I believe
that the great sage burped
because of something
that brother Bheem did.
Will you come
to aid us again, Govind?
Indeed
but
I will not be able
to aid all of you
in the place where
you must go now.
Great-grandsire, please accept 
my greetings.
If I meet you at home, I would've
asked for your blessings.
But we meet on the battlefield,
therefore, I ask you to fight me.
Who are you, lad?
Where did you get your ability
and courage to face me?
Who are you, warrior?
I'm son of Pandu's son, Arjun
with Yadava's daughter, Subhadra.
Abhimanyu.
My dear uncle is Krishna.
And today
I'm here on this battlefield
to challenge death.
Why don't you attack me, 
Great-grandsire?
No, child.
I can't attack you.
At this age, when you should be
learning knowledge
instead you have to
face us in battle.
This sight saddens me.
In relation with my family tree.
A new, healthy sprout.
Like a golden crown.
The new generation
shines.
That's what my dream is.
But today,
seeing the battlefield,
I feel that our family will soon perish.
I feel my whole life is a waste, child.
A great-grandfather endows knowledge
to his great-grandchildren.
He doesn't punish them.
You are my great-grandson.
I can only love you.
How can I possibly hurt you?
Go, child. Go away.
I, your great-grandson, do not 
admit defeat.
I won't go.
I admit my defeat, child.
Even the fact that I have 
to fight you,
instead of that, I choose to give in.
A family in which the youth dies,
would be felt lonely like 
a ruin of fire
inhabited by elders with 
deep guilts.
If only I were not under my oath,
then in this instance,
I would've given up my weapons
and become a hermit.
Go, child.
Don't challenge me. Go.
I'm like an arrow from Arjuna's Gandiva.
Once shot from the bow, it won't
get back to its storage.
Fight me.
Fight me, Great-grandsire!
Your great-grandfather commands you
to go from here.
Go!
I'm sorry, Great-grandsire,
you are my enemy.
I can't follow your orders.
My child,
the sun will soon sets.
Everyone's engaged.
Now. We have to go to Yudishthira.
We won't have a better chance.
He is alone, brother.
Charioteer, let's go.
I ask you, dear.
Go.
- No.
Dushasana, brother Yudishthira holds a spear.
The rule of war is clear.
A warrior can fight other warrior
only if they wield the same weapon.
Either you raise a spear,
or brother Yudishthira has to use a mace.
My dear.
Always use what suits you.
And use weapon,
that you're good at.
Use this brother Yudishthira.
So that you won't taint our name by saying
that we have broken the rule.
Your character is such that
even soiled and defiled,
it doesn't matter.
Unfortunately, Dushasana do not even
worried about his name.
Prince Arjuna, go and protect Emperor Yudishthira.
A warrior has to fight more than
one opponents,
is this not violating the rule, uncle?
You've told us to not worried about
defiling our names.
But it's not about that.
We are now worried about
our advantage.
We have to apologize for this action.
For our various unrighteous actions,
brother Yudishthira
We will apologize for this unrighteous act.
But only after killing you.
Won't you heed an old man
request, dear?
Go back.
Great-grandsire.
Protecting uncle Yudishthira is my duty.
So why do you
advise me otherwise?
Your courage is praiseworty, dear.
When you rule over all Aryan region,
I will be the proudest watcher from heaven.
King Madra, the sun almost sets.
The great Bhisma has returned.
We have to kill Yudishthira.
Attack him.
I can't attack behind his back,
evil Shakuni!
Like a crow, you are used to
disgusting life
but not me.
- A swan that live among crows
is just as disgusting, King Madra.
Not pure as well.
You have promised.
You have pledged loyalty to Duryodhana.
To help Duryodhana emerges victorious,
is you duty.
Attack him.
Throw your spear, King Madra!
Attack him!
Tomorrow's war
is the result of that oath.
No, Vasudev.
Tomorrow's war
is the result of
Hastinapur's arrogance.
By displaying its might,
Hastinapur
had covered my
beloved sister's fortune
with a cloth of darkness.
That day
I promised myself
that Hastinapur
will either give
my sister a present
for her sacrifice
or
pay dearly for it.
Getting a present and
paying dearly for a sacrifice!
One who deems sacrifice
a business dealing
certainly experiences agony.
It is such a strange thing!
Your sister made a sacrifice
but it was turned
into a business dealing
by you.
The truth is
under the garb
of exacting revenge
you wished to have opulence
and supreme power.
By calling your actions
a sacrifice
do not deceive yourself,
King of Gandhar.
Deception.
Deception!
Am I deceiving people
or are you
Vasudev?
By calling this war
a righteous one
you are deceiving
the entire Aryan region.
In the entire world
if there is someone
more wily than me
then it is
you, Vasudev.
I have firm faith
that in this war
of righteousness of yours
you will indeed use deceit
to justify
unrighteousness.
This is indeed a war of
righteousness, King of Gandhar.
In this war,
both might
and deceit shall be used.
To establish righteousness,
unrighteousness shall be used.
To safeguard the truth,
lies
will be told.
To champion life,
death shall be welcomed.
To usher the new creation,
the old
shall be annihilated.
Such faith!
Do you have such faith
in the competence
of the Pandavas?
No.
I have such faith
in you
and your deception.
I had told you
that various situations
have arisen and you
have been bound
to them in such a way
that in the end,
every deception of yours
will benefit only the Pandavas.
That is why,
King of Gandhar
you must now engage in deception
only after meditating over it.
From tomorrow,
every deception of yours
every treachery of yours
and every unrighteous deed
of yours shall meet its match.
Do remember that.
You need to remember
Vasudev
that you have taken an oath
of not taking to arms
in this war.
I have taken an oath
of not taking to arms
in this war, King of Gandhar.
However,
my might
is not my weapon.
In this battlefield, I bear
the might of righteousness.
That is my weapon
and also my armour.
And I am
the armour of your
beloved Pandavas.
Look at this battlefield.
The war will begin here at dawn.
Before dusk
there will be
so many corpses here
that even stones will float
in a river of blood.
There will be so much
bloodshed here
that the soil of this land
will remain red for eternity.
And I promise
that whoever dies
in this gruesome war
will indeed realize what
righteousness is at the end.
The purpose of this war
is to establish righteousness
and till the end of time
it shall be known as Mahabharat,
the war of righteousness.
Friend Karna
what have you done?
You gave away your armour
and ear-rings as charity!
They were a part of you,
friend Karna.
How could you chop off a part
of your body and give it away?
Had a treacherous person
asked you for your right arm
would you have
given it away as well?
Why did you act
so foolishly, friend?
Why did you act so foolishly?
What good is duty
if, in the process of
discharging it, might, future
hope and even life
have to sacrificed?
When everything needs
to be sacrificed, friend...
Pardon me,
friend.
Pardon me.
Had I broken one oath of mine
I would have had the thought
of breaking another.
And possibly
in the battlefield
I would not have been able
to discharge my duties, friend.
I
shall heal soon,
friend.
My darling
let's go.
The healer
will take care
of King Karna of Anga.
I had told you,
my darling!
His righteousness is his limit!
And King Karna of Anga
has great pride
in his righteousness!
Do you remember what your guru,
the mighty Balaram had said?
Whenever righteousness
and pride come together
man meets with loss.
This is the reason
why Yudhishthir had accepted
to go on an exile
while he wishes
to exit this world.
This is the reason
why King Karna of Anga
never had my complete trust.
I was alluding
to the armour and ear-rings
of King Karna of Anga.
And now,
they are gone.
Now,
let him go as well.
But uncle...
- This is not the time
for 'ifs' and 'buts,
my darling!
The holy armour
of King Karna of Anga
is gone!
At a time like this
it is important to augment
our army...
And there is going to be
an addition of
two 'akshauhini' armies
to our existing army.
Karna...
Karna!
Karna.
- Son!
Karna...
- My Lord! - Son!
Healer
why is his breathing
so irregular?
His condition is critical.
Upon cutting out
the holy armour and ear-rings
the resulting wounds
on King Karna of Anga
are not healing
with the traditional herbs.
We cannot do anything for him.
But healer,
my son is in great agony.
Do something.
Radha
Karna will indeed get better.
Have faith.
- Faith?!
On whom?
You?!
The mother of the people who
robbed my son of his divinity
is reassuring me!
Be quiet,
Radha.
No,
My Lord.
I will not be quiet today.
What kind of an enmity made them
snatch my son's divinity
from him?
In order to secure
the victory of your children
you engaged in such treachery!
How can you even call yourself
a righteous person?!
Please believe me,
Radha.
I have engaged
in no such treachery.
Then why did
the father of your son
take away the divinity
of my Radheya?
Did he think that just because
he is the son of a charioteer
he could act treacherously
with him?!
My son was born to be
seated on the throne.
But he
grew up deeming the lap of his
impoverished father a throne.
My son had the capability
of standing tall next to
the greatest of Kings
but his childhood
was spent standing behind
domestic help.
The armour and ear-rings
denoted his divinity
but they were
snatched from him as well!
For safeguarding
the lives of your sons
do accept my greetings,
Queen Mother!
But you have murdered my son!
You have murdered my son...
Do not say that,
Radha.
Karna...
Karna is my son.
No!
Had he been your son
he would never have met
with such treachery!
If you say
that Karna is your son
then please save his life.
Your sons,
Nakul and Sahadev
have been blessed
by the Ashwini Kumaras.
I request you
to alleviate the agony
of my son, Queen Mother!
Alleviate it...
Queen Mother
can Prince Sahadev
and Prince Nakul
heal My Lord,
their elder brother...
Can they deem him
their elder brother
and heal him?
No, Vrushali.
Why would they do that?
My son is their enemy after all.
And who can ever save
the life of one's enemy?
In a battle,
it is a rule
that if the entire army
gets annihilated
or all the soldiers
flee from the battlefield
then the King must surrender.
The King cannot even challenge
the enemy to a duel then.
That is why, in order to sustain
in the battlefield
we require a large army.
We have
a seven 'akshauhini' army
while our enemies have nine.
We must acquire an additional
two 'akshauhini' armies
at any cost.
Ruler of Madra,
King Shalya
the elder brother
of Mother Madri.
Nakul has
requested him to aid us.
The two 'akshauhini' army of his
is just as mighty
as the Narayani Army.
Very soon, uncle Shalya
shall be here with his army.
In other words,
our army
will be as big and mighty
as that of the Kauravas.
We have also arranged
for them to rest on the way
brother Yudhishthir.
Sons...
Mother.
Mother
is there a problem?
There is bound to be a problem,
brother Yudhishthir.
Our mother is residing
in the enemy camp.
She was residing there,
brother Bheem.
Now,
she has come to us.
Greetings, mother.
Greetings, mother.
What is the matter,
mother?
Why do you not seem happy?
Even after meeting your sons
after such a long time
are you not happy?
No, son.
A mother is weeping here
and it is time to wipe away
the tears of that mother.
Whose mother?
The mother
of King Karna of Anga.
Nakul, Sahadev
the two of you need to
come with me this instant.
King Karna of Anga
is in great agony, sons.
What is the matter,
mother?
What agony?
- Son
King Karna of Anga
is gravely wounded.
If...
If he does not receive
the holy herbs from Nakul
and Sahadev soon then...
Then finding a remedy to his
agony will become impossible.
Please pardon me,
Queen Mother Kunti, but
if the soldiers of the Kaurava
army get injured in the war
then will they be treated by
Prince Nakul and Prince Sahadev?
Then there is no point
in waging a war.
The war has not begun yet.
And at a time like this
it is our duty to protect
the life of an injured person.
King Karna of Anga would never
have mercy on your sons, mother.
Had there been kindness
or righteousness in his heart
your daughter-in-law would
not have been subjected
to grave humiliation during
the game of dice, mother.
Man behaves according to
the circumstance he is in, son.
At the moment
the circumstances are different.
How is today's situation
any different, mother?
Sons
the King of Anga...
King Karna of Anga...
Now leave.
Early in the morning
get Rukmini to the temple
of Goddess Parvati.*
*The wife of Shiva and the gentle aspect of Maha Devi or Durga.
I will be waiting for you.
Hold on!
Who are you?
I'm a maid.
I haven't seen you here before.
This means
that you keep an eye
on all the maids here.
It is not respectable for
a soldier. - Don't argue.
Nobody is permitted
to meet the princess.
I have
brought Maharishi Durvasa's
sacrament with me.
If the princess does not
have this sacrament
she will never
get married.
No!
You cannot go.
Okay, soldier, tell me
is the prince of Chedi
handsome?
Maybe.
Why?
Okay, I'll have this...
I'll have this sacrament.
Then I'll get married to him.
This sacrament is very powerful.
The princess cannot get married
until she has this sacrament.
Stop!
This isn't a sacrament
but an opportunity.
If you want,
you can have some too.
Go give it to the princess.
Give it a thought, Rukmini.
Chedi's prince Sishupal is here.
Tomorrow morning the wedding
ceremony will be completed.
Do you know what will happen if
you decide against the marriage?
Prince Sishupal will get upset.
That is why I had told you...
Had requested you earnestly
not to invite him for
the wedding.
Don't act foolish, Rukmini.
Father will be humiliated.
Chedi and Vidharbha
will be at war.
A monarch like King Jarasandh
will be angry with us.
Don't worry about that, brother.
My Lord Krishna will protect you
from the monarch of Magadh.
Krishna! Krishna!
Krishna!
What are you saying!
There
you too have chanted his
name thrice just now.
This time, your death
will surely get averted.
Keep quiet!
You will get married
to the Prince of Chedi.
Now don't even let the
thought of that cowherd
come to your mind.
That shall be best for you.
You can build a dam on
a flowing river
but you cannot build
a dam on falling rains.
Chanting Krishna's name
is like shower of nectar
in my life.
How can I stop it?
I'm already married, brother.
My Lord will arrive
and take me with him
to his house.
This is impossible, Rukmini.
That cowherd can't even step
into my province.
Look in all four
directions, brother
there's only Krishna
everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.
Rukmini!
Wherever I go
I will get closer
to my Lord.
Stop rambling, Rukmini!
You will get married
to prince Sishupal.
You will now leave
this chamber
only to go to the
wedding booth.
Until it's the auspicious time
for the wedding
you shall not leave
this chamber.
Who are you?
This...
This is Maharishi Durvasa's
sacrament.
Fine! Go give it!
Maybe this sacrament can
reinstate some sanity to her.
You seem to be out of
your senses, prince.
Krishna has not only
entered your province
but your palace too.
I had completely forgotten
how beautiful peacock
feathers are.
I used to think
that they look beautiful because
they're on Krishna's crown.
Who are you?
And
how did you enter...
- I'm Arjun...
I'm cowherd, Branala...
You...
Who I am
is of no importance.
What's important is
that you had written a letter
to my brother Krishna.
And in that letter you
had written
that you will wait for him
at Goddess Parvati's temple.
It's time.
And you're still here!
This means
Krishna has arrived
on my invitation.
You will know that only
when you go there.
Please come.
Where are you both going?
Wait.
The princess is prohibited from
leaving the chamber.
Actually
Maharishi Durvasa's sacrament
has to be consumed
by the princess
in Goddess Parvati's temple.
That's not necessary.
The princess will not
leave the palace.
As you wish.
But
Maharishi Durvasa
already knew
that the princess would be
against this wedding.
Hence
he has
sent this special sacrament.
If the princess
goes to Goddess
Parvati's temple
and consumes this sacrament
while performing the veneration
then the sacrament will
show its miracle.
And she will get married
to the one
she is supposed to.
Believe me, princess.
Fine.
You can go, Rukmini.
Even I'll come along with you.
No...
I don't want to go anywhere.
I don't want any sacrament.
I will not go.
Only you can convince her now.
Once she consumes this
sacrament at the temple
she shall forget
to protest.
Come on, Rukmini.
I told you,
I don't want to go.
I don't...
- Come, Rukmini.
I don't want to go.
Detain him!
- What do we do now?
Lord Krishna says
that when there is an
opportunity to run
one should run.
Soldiers
that messenger shouldn't
be spared alive!
Catch him!
Princess Rukmini
you go to the temple,
I'll handle them.
The Gods have showered their
blessings upon us, King Drupad.
In exchange for our merits
they have blessed you
with a son.
It is now time
to obtain the great blessing
which is a part of your destiny.
For the birth of your daughter
make the sacrifices,
Your Highness!
I am not a fool, great sage.
I wanted a son
and I have got one.
Now, I do not wish
to sacrifice anything.
Let's go, son.
Stop! King Drupad!
The maiden born
from this 'yajna
is the fate of the Aryan region!
You must accept her!
No woman can ever be
a person's fate, great sage.
A father never obtains
anything from his daughter.
Let's go, son.
You are a fool, Drupad!
One obtains love
from one's daughter!
One obtains respect
from one's daughter!
One obtains righteousness
from one's daughter!
Do not forget, King Drupad
that a son bestows only
his family with righteousness!
But a daughter blesses
the future generations
and the entire world
with righteousness!
All that is good in the world
is obtained only from
a daughter, Drupad!
The wrath of the Gods
is increasing, Drupad!
Do not be foolish!
Come back for the 'yajna!
Stop, Drupad!
You will not be able to leave
this 'yajna' incomplete!
And the Gods will not
permit you to leave.
What will the Gods give me
by forcing me
to make a sacrifice?!
What will they give me?!
Then I shall make a sacrifice!
Do the Gods wish to bless
the entire world through me?!
Then I
ask for lifelong struggle
for my daughter!
I ask for pain!
What are you asking for,
Drupad?!
How can you ask for pain
for your own daughter?!
Why not?
With pain and struggles does
the best of character get built!
May her character be as pure and fair as this 'abeer.'*
*A dye (dry powder) from flower extracts.
May she have all the
impurities of the world!
Yet the world
must deem her pure!
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?!
Like this wheat,
may she have the strength
to give courage to others!
May she keep facing situations
that can damage the morale
of any person.
Yet she must remain courageous
and give courage to others.
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?!
This 'gulaal'* never changes its colour!
*Colored powder solutions thrown during Holi/the festival of colors or the festival of love.
May she have
such steadfast valour.
Can I get such a daughter?!
Nothing is more beautiful in the world than this 'kumkum'* here.
*Powder used for social and religious markings--made from turmeric or saffron.
Just like this 'kumkum,
may my daughter
be the most beautiful woman
in this world!
And may she reflect
the beauty of others as well.
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?!
These flowers here...
When flowers are crushed,
they emit fragrance.
May she face injustice
time and again!
Yet she must spread
the fragrance of justice!
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?
To carry out the wishes
of the Gods
is why this maiden
has been born, Drupad!
Take good care of her!
You have never had anything
precious like her before
and neither will you ever have!
King Drupad
this maiden will change
the future of the Aryan region.
She will create a new history!
This is your daughter, Drupad!
The Gods have named her Krishna.*
*One of darker complexion.
Since she is born from a 'yajna
she shall be called Yajnaseni!
The world will remember you
by her name!
She shall be called Draupadi!
Bless you!
With the brilliance
of fire on the face
with the heat of fire
in the breath
and with the purity of fire
in the heart was born
your daughter, father.
I place the boon of the Gods
at your feet.
Goodbye, Your Majesty.
Bless you.
Goodbye, grandfather.
May you live long.
Goodbye, father.
May you be victorious, son.
May you be victorious.
Goodbye, uncle.
Bless you.
- Goodbye, teacher.
May you be victorious.
Goodbye, grandfather.
Goodbye.
May you be victorious.
Princes
this is the first battle
of your lives.
All the art and knowledge
taught by me
and even your might
will seem scant in this battle
because your opponent
is my friend Drupad.
From my revered father
the great sage Bharadwaj
Drupad learnt the same art
which all of you
have learnt from me.
Me and my son Ashwatthama
will not take part
in this battle
because Drupad had told me
that if I am proud of my art
then I needed
to generate a warrior
who could defeat him.
And I have
accepted his challenge.
All of you
must uphold the honour
of your teacher.
If anyone is fearful
of this battle then
I release that person
from the duty
of Paying my fee.
Is there anyone
who doubts my teachings
or has no faith
in his own ability?
Is there anyone?
We have faith, teacher!
We have faith, teacher!
Splendid.
All of you may proceed
for the battle.
But the sons of Dhritarashtra
must go back.
Father, what are you saying?
What kind of partiality is this?
It is not partiality.
It is not partiality at all!
One who doubts my teachings
and has no faith
in his own capability
cannot be accepted by me
as my disciple.
I cannot ask for my fee
from such a person, Ashwatthama.
If I had to defeat Drupad
by any means possible
then I would have approached
the King of Hastinapur
as a trader intent on
making a business deal.
I would not have meditated
and waited all these years.
But we have
complete faith, teacher.
In order to protect oneself, if
one is accompanied by a warrior
who is not my disciple
I do not deem it faith, Prince.
I have no faith in his archery
because I did not
teach him that.
I do not know from where
he learnt the art.
Hence, if you lose
because of him
I will be the one
to be humiliated.
And even if you win
because of him
I will still be humiliated.
The Region of Arya.
North, North-East,
East, South-East
South, South-West,
West, North-West.
Vidarbh, Kunti,
Hastinapur.
Ganges,
Panchal
City of Kampilya.
Is Drupad really that illusory
brother Arjun?
Those who
do not trust their eyesight
their vision cannot be
restrained by anything.
The biggest victory is
to gain victory
over one's senses.
Learn to control your senses
like me, Sahadev.
One who does not seek
any happiness in his life
cannot be defeated by anyone.
Would you like to have
a 'laddoo,' brother Bheem?
Laddoo!
Where is it?
Do you have one?
Could I have it?
This is my brother
who seeks no happiness
in this world.
I have taken the oath of
not eating 'laddoos,' brother.
I shall not even
think about them.
I might think about them
but I won't eat any
until we defeat Drupad
and have you
coronated as the Prince.
Panchal.
We shall make use
of the spiral formation.
We shall divide ourselves
into three battalions.
The first battalion,
comprising me, shall lead.
Dusshasan
you shall lead
the second battalion.
Your battalion will be behind
mine in the southern direction.
Vikarna
your battalion shall be
in the north
and will attack
from that direction.
In order to navigate
through any labyrinth
the 'Sharvyooh'* is the most efficient one.
*Chakravyuh or Padmavyuh, is a multi-tier defensive formation that looks like a blooming lotus (padma, ) or disc (chakra, ).
Drupad will certainly be
at the center of his army.
I
need to reach him.
Friend Duryodhan
before we defeat Drupad,
we must defeat his General.
I have heard
that Drupad's General
is immortal.
No one is immortal.
But Drupad's General cannot die.
It is due to an oath
taken in his past life.
And until he fulfills it
he won't die.
And that is why
Drupad has made him his General.
No matter how many times
the enemies kill him
he rises up every single time.
And upon seeing this miracle
their enemies run away
out of fright.
Friend, if we tie him up with a 'Paashastra'*
Snare tactic.
then defeating Drupad
will not be impossible.
Vikarna, do you know
how to use a 'Paashastra'?
I do know, brother
but I have no faith in me.
But Arjun knows.
To win with the help of Arjun
is to be defeated, friend.
Do remember, Dusshasan.
Under all circumstances
Drupad must be defeated
only at my hands.
This is mandatory.
But how will you
achieve this, friend?
Yudhishthir is the eldest.
He will also be
the General of your army.
And you will have to fight
according to his strategies.
In other words,
under all circumstances
Yudhishthir is bound to win.
Did you hear, General?
Drona is arriving here
with the Princes of Hastinapur.
They are only 105 princes
but you have
two limitless armies with you.
Take them in as prisoners.
Then Bhishma will come
to save them.
The aim of your life
will be fulfilled
and Panchal will take over
the kingdom of Hastinapur.
I am here as the representative
of the kingdom of Hastinapur.
I have come here on behalf
of Prince Vichitravirya
to ask for the hands
of your daughters in marriage.
If any of the Kings
present here disagree with me
then that King has the right
to challenge me.
A true warrior
can never pass up
an opportunity for a combat,
son of Ganga!
I have accepted King Shalv!
as my husband with my heart.
That I'll choose King Shalv as
my husband in this 'swayamvar
had already been decided.
You have won me in the court
by displaying your might.
Now, if I am to be married
it will be only with you,
son of Ganga, Bhishma!
But this is not possible.
I have taken
a vow of celibacy.
And I am here to break
that very vow, Bhishma.
You should seek the help
of my teacher, Lord Parashuram
and if I am guilty
then only one person
is capable of punishing me
namely, my teacher
Lord Parashuram.
Until the solution
to my problem is found
Lord Parashuram
must continue this battle.
My Lord,
fulfill this wish of mine.
I wish to see him dead,
Mahadev.
I wish to be
the reason of his death.
Aiming at a higher goal
or more a noble deed
when you wish
the death of Bhishma
you will certainly become
the reason of his demise.
Then I do not wish to live
but I shall return
in my next life
after 25 years.
This girl will take revenge
for my insult.
And this girl shall be
called Shikhandini.
And when your soul
will be fatigued and aged
I shall be born with
the purpose of killing you.
Bhishma!
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra
will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.
As long as you bear your armour
and stand before me
it is impossible to kill me.
This armour of yours
makes you invincible, friend.
However,
it makes me immortal.
Your holy armour is
undoubtedly important to you.
However, it is
more important to me, friend.
Greetings,
revered 'Brahmin'.
I am a requester.
I have been travelling to seek
something, King of Anga
which is both death
and ambrosia.
It is both living
and also the cause of life.
It is both visible
and invisible.
It is gentle
yet tough.
It is a part of the body
but also a means.
It is both pure and impure.
My armour and ear-rings.
As they are a blessing,
they are pure.
However, as they are joined
to my body, they are impure.
They are both
visible and invisible.
As long as they are
joined to my body
they act as ambrosia.
However, when they will be
separated from my body
they will become
the cause of my death.
Have you not come here
to ask for these
Lord Indra?
Your father must indeed
have told you, dear.
Tomorrow at dawn
I am going to ask you
for your ear-rings and armour.
Does your son
have no competence
to retaliate against me?
Is he scared of
my armour and ear-rings?
Looking for ways to ensure
the protection of one's son
is the right of every father.
My son's fear has got
nothing to do with this!
However
the apprehensions within
the heart of a father
are certainly
associated with it.
Despite being a God, how can
you be so partial, Lord Indra?
The enmity between people is
limited solely to their deaths.
If the immortal Gods
begin to act partially
it would be a disgrace to them.
Even the waves of the ocean
compete with each other.
However, the ocean does not
act partially towards any wave.
Do you not have faith
in your competence?
Or without your armour
will you not be able
to confront Arjun?
Is that what you fear?
I do not fear for myself,
Lord Indra.
I have firm faith
that I shall indeed slay Arjun.
Then the entire world will know
who the true brave one is.
But the question here is
not solely about my bravery.
It is about the trust
of my friend.
I have taken an oath
to protect him
and help him gain victory.
By taking my armour away
you are being
unjust to my friend.
I request you...
- The decision is yours!
If you do not wish to engage
in charity then just say so.
And if you do not have
the courage to refuse me
then offering Surya Dev
water at dawn is a right
you will no longer have.
You need to decide which oath
is more important to you
out of the two oaths of yours.
I shall wait at the river-bank
at dawn with the intent
of seeking charity from you.
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra
will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.
These make you immortal and
denote your divinity as well.
Without them,
the weapons of Arjun
will be able
to pierce your body.
Tomorrow at dawn
I am going to ask you
for your ear-rings and armour.
Your competence does not lie
in your armour
but in your armour
lies my protection.
If the Pandavas
attack me with a weapon
then this holy armour of yours
will protect me like a fort,
friend Karna.
I shall wait at the river-bank
at dawn with the intent
of seeking charity from you.
It is almost time for dawn,
Madhav
but Surya Dev refuses
to grace us with His presence.
Wars do not exist
solely in battlefields.
Sometimes
a war can take place
within the heart, friend.
And then, the darkness of
the heart cannot be dispelled.
Even the darkness of Surya Dev
himself cannot be dispelled.
But why would
the heart of Surya Dev
be troubled with a war,
Madhav?
Where there is attachment
there is struggle.
And where there is struggle,
there is
the hope of victory.
There is the hope of success.
However,
be it life or a war
success can be had
only with the aid
of three weapons.
Righteousness,
patience
and courage.
The rest of the weapons
are merely means.
You forgot one more weapon,
Vasudev.
And that weapon
is opportunity.
Without opportunity
righteousness remains latent
so does courage
and patience does not exist.
Bless you, Arjun,
son of Pandu.
Vasudev Krishna
do accept my greetings.
Greetings.
In order to establish
righteousness on the earth
the great initiative you have
taken in the form of this war
just fills my heart
with great respect for you.
The human beings who will
fight from your side in this war
will be exceedingly fortunate.
But an old 'Brahmin' like me
does not have the strength
to bear any weapon.
However,
I wish to contribute
something precious
to this great undertaking.
You are too kind,
revered 'Brahmin.
However,
a war
demands the shedding of blood.
Splendid.
Then that is how I shall
contribute, Arjun, son of Kunti.
But is blood not shed
in a battlefield?
It is not shed before a war.
By acquiring knowledge
man creates opportunities
for himself
for his success in the future.
In order to be able
to shed blood in a war
it is better to create
opportunities today itself
Vasudev.
And this would be
my contribution.
An opportunity to shed blood.
Surya Dev
it is time for you to rise.
The entire creation awaits you.
Everyone is your child.
For the benefit
of one son of yours
do not keep the other children
of yours from your light.
Once, the son of Pavan Dev* had hidden you in His mouth.
*Pavana (the Purifier), other name of Vayu, the god of the winds.
The entire creation was on
the verge of destruction then.
I request you,
father.
Please show yourself
and accept my offering.
In the dilemmas of life,
please allow your son
to take his own decisions,
father.
At some point of time in life
every person is robbed of
the protection of his father
and that is when his competence
is truly put to the test
father.
Even a tree
lets go of its fruits
in order to aid the creation
generate new life.
Allow the world to test
my competence, father
so that no one is able to say
that I gained victory
with your help.
If that happens
then my entire life
will be tainted.
I too am a part
of your light, father.
Instead of living in
the darkness of a tainted life
it would be better
if I die a death of glory.
I request you,
father.
Please show yourself
and accept my offering.
I am prepared
to give your son an opportunity
to win, Lord Indra.
Emitting light to the world
does not lessen the sun's power.
The son of Lord Surya
is still competent enough.
Tell me.
What is it that you
wish to seek from me?
But what will that
revered 'Brahmin' give me
that will become
an opportunity for me?
Call it deceit, treachery
or opportunity
but all the attempts
to allay an agitated mind
hold no value.
Where there is righteousness,
patience and courage
there is success.
And one is bound to find success
with their aid, friend.
Without opportunity,
righteousness remains latent
courage is dormant
and patience is lost...
This is what he had said.
Righteousness
is nothing but a lie
if it requires opportunity.
Courage is incomplete
if it lies dormant
until opportunity beckons.
Patience is worthless
if it is lost
before achieving success.
Then why did you
accept his aid, Madhav?
What he said was correct,
friend.
In this war of righteousness
every contribution is precious.
What can he gives me
that will become an opportunity
for victory for me?
Rendering the enemy
weak in a war
is also called an opportunity,
friend.
Guru Arjun
no armour is safe
from your arrows.
One would require
a holy armour for that.
When a mother cries
because of her son
a strange agony pervades
her emotions and even her laugh
gets tainted by it, mother.
Look.
I am smiling now.
Now, quit feeling sad.
Today, you have made me
very happy, son.
Sit down here with me.
I will feed you myself.
Today, even grandfather Bhishma
was deeply hurt because of me.
Shall I go and apologize to him?
Then I shall return for my meal.
You decided to forge an enmity
with Anga Pradesh?
You have given Hastinapur
an invitation to a war!
Prince Arjun
you must wash the feet
of His Highness Karna
and ask him for forgiveness.
Pardon me, King of Anga.
Greetings, grandfather.
What happened at the banquet
today was inappropriate, Arjun.
I am here to apologize
to you, grandfather.
Why should you apologize?
What I did was inappropriate.
What Dhritarashtra did
was inappropriate.
To take your and Karna's
personal differences
and to colour it with politics
was utterly inappropriate.
But Vidur and I
kept quiet.
I am not angry with either
you or uncle, grandfather.
I understand your dilemma.
No, Arjun.
You do not understand.
You do not understand...
When offering greetings to a Shiv Lingam*
*Linga/rock symbol of Shiva.
the ants crawling over it
also receive the greetings.
Similar is the state of people
who serve the throne.
If an undeserving person
is the king of a place
then anything done by the people
who serve the throne
can never be appropriate
in totality.
That is why, it is important
to coronate a deserving person
the King of Hastinapur.
But if
tomorrow at the court,
Dhritarashtra
takes an inappropriate decision
then the Kuru kingdom
will see all its hopes crumble.
Grandfather
if you allow us
then at any given point
of time, us brothers
can have our eldest brother
coronated as the King.
All of you are indeed
great warriors
but if you draw a weapon
against Hastinapur
then I shall stop you
from doing so.
And until the Almighty
himself aids you
you cannot defeat me.
Right now, I
see only one way out.
Pray to the Almighty, Arjun.
Pray to Him.
Whenever man is faced
with a dreadful situation
he prays to the Almighty.
He pleads to the Lord to aid him
overcome the situation.
But
what does this prayer
truly mean?
Have we ever thought about it?
The meaning of a prayer
is to take one's apprehensions,
one's worries
one's resolutions, one's options
and one's plans
and place them at
the feet of the Almighty.
In other words
instead of worrying about
what one's actions will yield
acting righteously
and deeming the Almighty's plan
as one's fate...
Is this not praying?
But is understanding
the Almighty's plan
ever possible?
Those plans always culminate
into the results of our actions.
But if someone
stops acting altogether
can it be termed as praying?
The truth is,
actions equate to life.
And keeping oneself
from coveting results
is praying truly.
If a prayer
impedes one's actions
and prevents man from acting
then is it a prayer or defeat?
Think about it.
Greetings, father.
You seem very happy, son.
Yes, father.
I am very happy!
You had taken an oath
that you will make me King.
But father
to aid me and the generations
that come after me
have a prosperous future
was not something
you had ever planned.
I have made such a plan.
And how is that, son?
Father, when my friend
Duryodhan becomes King
he will aid me
in protecting my kingdom.
I made him promise me today.
An incapable person
is always the first
to make promises.
What do you think, father?
Will my friend not become King?
No, he will not.
He will not.
The Prince will be crowned
based on his competence.
And he not becoming King
is in the best interest of
the Kuru kingdom and Hastinapur.
But father
tomorrow, King Dhritarashtra
will declare his son
as the crowned Prince.
Are you telling the truth?
Who gave him the right to do so?
Father
how can you question
the rights of a King?
No.
I am questioning my own rights.
You will not understand.
Go to bed.
Today, Hastinapur is celebrating
the coronation ceremony
of its Prince!
Sculptor
let my idol be so high
that the other idols
look smaller in comparison
because I am to become
the most able
and most powerful King of India.
But Prince, to make
the idols of the same height
is tradition.
The idol of a new King
cannot be taller than
that of his ancestors.
A King's order is more important
than tradition, sculptor!
I shall go right away and get
the permission of His Highness.
Stop, Dusshasan!
Why should we break
tradition unnecessarily?
The idol cannot be too high
but
it can be at an elevated place.
That was a splendid suggestion,
friend Ashwatthama.
Now, the question is, what should
be kept beneath this idol?
Have my idol placed
below yours, friend.
And have your idol
mounted on my shoulders.
That cannot be.
I stand by my friends,
King of Anga.
And I stand on the shoulders
of my enemies.
Brother, then there should be
five idols beneath yours.
Why base them on five humans?
Those idols can also be
of five animals.
And one of them
will be a donkey, friend.
With a bow and arrows
in his hands.
Bheem!
Gandhari.
What is this, brother?
Offering to the dead.
Do you not know what it is?
And which ungratified spirit
is offered iron, brother?
An ungratified spirit
is offered wheat flour.
But an ungratified desire
is offered iron.
Today, my ungratified desire
shall finally be fulfilled.
Today, my nephew
will become the crowned
Prince of Hastinapur.
And very soon
Hastinapur
will transform into Gandhar!
In other words
by making Duryodhan
the crowned Prince
you wish to destroy
the kingdom of Hastinapur?
You are foolish,
beloved Gandhari.
I will not destroy
the kingdom of Hastinapur.
I will destroy
only the arrogance
and the unjust values
of this dynasty.
This empire may be called
the kingdom of Kuru
but it will become
Gandhar!
Because its governance
will be based upon Gandhar's
rules and principles.
Brother...
- Sister
you cannot protest to this
because I am not doing anything
that will harm either
your 100 sons or your husband.
My fight had always
been with the
son of Ganga, Bhishma.
The arrogance with which
he had arrived in Gandhar
will be blown into pieces today.
Today, the son of Ganga, Bhishma
will be defeated!
Forever!
Today, in Hastinapur
the Prince of the Kuru Kingdom
will be announced!
King Dhritarashtra
is making his entrance!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
Ministers and people
in the court
all of you must be eager
to know the King's decision
but, Your Majesty
before you announce
the crowned Prince
if the great Bhishma
blesses the Princes
then the education of
the Princes will be complete.
But only if you allow it.
Certainly.
Uncle shall address the court.
What is he about to say?
Apart from blessing us
what else can he say, uncle?
Listening to one's enemy
makes not only the people
who hear it repent
but also the ones who don't,
repent as well.
What happened, uncle?
Why did you stop that chariot?
Where are you going?
Gandhar awaits me, my darling.
Now, I have nothing
left to do in Hastinapur.
What are you saying, uncle?
You would leave for Gandhar
only after getting me anointed...
You had taken such an oath.
Anointed...
You cannot get anointed,
my darling.
All my life
I have tried to make you King
but now, I have
been defeated, my darling.
How did you get defeated, uncle?
Seeing that the Pandavas
are alive?
But I am still the Crown Prince.
I do not fear the sons of Pandu.
If they have
the strength of Panchal
then I have
the army of Hastinapur.
Do not make such a mistake,
my darling.
Deeming Bali, the King
of the 'Vanaras,' dead
Sugriv had become the King.
When Bali returned
safe and sound
not only did Sugriv
have to leave the city
but also the kingdom
of Kishkindha.
Upon learning that the previous
Crown Prince is alive
no one will deem you
the Crown Prince.
Our competence is not dead yet,
King of Gandhar.
I will use my competence
to make friend Duryodhan King.
My beloved Duryodhan
a river nourishes the fields
but when it floods them
it covers the entire land
with sand.
Then nothing grows on it.
The land becomes barren.
Similar is the case
with friendship.
But uncle, my friend Karna...
I do not doubt him, beloved!
He has great valour and
incomparable competence.
He is completely
dedicated to you but
when it comes to
righteousness and friendship
deciding between the two
is exceedingly difficult
for the King of Anga.
Today, had he
killed Bheem and Arjun
had righteousness and generosity
not stemmed within him
you could have had
the kingdom with great ease.
Had I killed Bheem and Arjun
today, King of Gandhar
the entire Aryan region
would have known
about the identity
of the deceased.
And it would have also known
about the people who are alive.
And then the great Bhishma
would certainly have brought
Yudhishthir to Hastinapur.
Such deep thinking!
After such deep thinking
did you decide upon not fighting
King Karna of Anga?!
No, King of Gandhar.
I had thought only of my duty.
It is the duty
of a competent warrior
to either strive for his victory
or
praise that of another.
And when a person takes a
decision based on righteousness
the decision is always correct.
And did you not think,
King of Anga
that when Yudhishthir
will return to Hastinapur
he will be protected
by great warriors
like Bheem and Arjun?
And behind them will be
the entire army of Drupad!
Do remember one thing,
my darling.
When Yudhishthir
will return to Hastinapur
that old man
will never let you become King.
Uncle
why do you not
suggest something?
There is a way out, my darling.
But this time,
you must listen to me.
And so must your friend.
Do I have your word?
You have my word, uncle.
Then listen...
The Pandavas are alive
but before this news spreads
to the people of Hastinapur
You must get yourself anointed
as the Crown Prince.
But
your father's heart
keeps turning towards
righteousness.
That is why
until you get anointed
you must keep it
a secret from him
that the five of them are alive.
Yudhishthir has
not yet been anointed.
If you get anointed
then
Yudhishthir's right
will get annihilated.
And the marriage to
the Princess of Panchal
will not benefit him
either, my darling!
Stop, priest.
Before the marriage
ceremony begins
I wish to have some answers,
Great Sage Vyas.
Right before my eyes,
my daughter
is about to enter a life
which will be more painful
than a funeral pyre.
You have deemed it righteous
but will the world?
You have deemed it righteous
but will the world?
Will she get happiness from
this terrible sacrifice of hers?
You are correct, King Drupad.
Princes
marriage is based upon
seven vows, which are taken
by the bride and the groom.
But this is
an atypical marriage.
In order to make it
fruitful and righteous
you must take
some additional vows.
The way a plant cannot be sown
in two different places at once
and a Minister cannot
serve two Kings
similarly, at a time, dedication
can only be towards one person,
sons of Pandu.
So, how can a woman
fulfill her duties
towards five husbands
at the same time?
A single person cannot dedicate
oneself to five people, My Lord.
But five people can certainly
be dedicated to a single person.
We five brothers dedicate
ourselves to Princess Draupadi
now and forever.
We shall accept
all her decisions.
Splendid, Yudhishthir.
For an entire year, Draupadi
will be wife to only one of you.
During that period
only that person can enter
Draupadi's chamber
to whom she gives
the right to do so.
For the sake
of Draupadi's happiness
I am asking
for this difficult vow.
But isn't the basis
of a relationship
not remembrance, My Lord?
Then after a year,
how will my sister
free herself from
the joys and sorrows?
She will get crushed
under those memories, My Lord.
Every year, I shall perform
an austere meditation
before the holy fire.
By forgetting the relationships
and memories of the past
I shall purify my soul.
My Lord
not only Princess Draupadi
but also we five brothers
shall perform such a meditation
every year.
We take such an oath.
I have another question,
My Lord.
For various reasons,
Princes have to
marry multiple times.
If the Pandavas
bring their other wives
then what will become
of my daughter?
People do not
fulfill their duties
towards somebody over which
everyone has the right.
This question relates
only to me, My Lord.
Only I have been married.
I give my word
that I shall never bring
my first wife
within the perimeters
of the city.
Irrespective of where we live,
there will be only one Queen
and that will be
Princess Draupadi.
We take an oath that
we shall fulfill our vows
for as long as we live.
May the Almighty fill our lives
with righteousness.
Priest
begin the marriage ceremony.
This is such a vortex
of darkness.
This is an oath
for my honour.
It seems to be
on the verge of success.
The more difficult
the struggle
the stronger the basis.
This is my
duty as a woman.
My heart must remain steadfast
and this is a vow
I must fulfill.
My heart will remain steadfast
and this is why
I have been born.
The evening sky is
a shade of vermillion.
This is a grave moral dilemma
in the history
of genesis.
My heart must remain steadfast
and this is a vow
I must fulfill.
My heart will remain steadfast
and this is why
I have been born.
My heart must remain steadfast
and this is a vow
I must fulfill.
My heart will remain steadfast
and this is why
I have been born.
My heart must remain steadfast
and this is a vow
I must fulfill.
My heart will remain steadfast
and this is why
I have been born.
My heart
will remain
steadfast.
Vrushali.
You need not worry, dear.
Even though I cannot go
to Indraprastha
it is alright.
I will request Her Highness
to ensure that you
get your freedom.
I know
that the day
I plead to sister-in-law
will be the last day of my life.
But I
am the mother of the Pandavas.
The promise I made you
cannot be broken by me.
All hail Queen Mother!
King Karna of Anga
seeks permission to enter.
Allow him to enter.
Greetings,
Queen Mother!
Bless you!
I have ensured
Vrushali's freedom.
Let's go,
Vrushali.
I shall take you to the borders
of Indraprastha safely.
I...
Pardon me.
But
I can go there by myself.
You need not bother
yourself with it.
Why?
Do you doubt my character?
No!
No, Your Highness.
I do not doubt your character.
But...
Pardon me.
I have travelled
with the royalty once.
Your Highness
when an elephant
comes to pluck lotuses
it does not crush the flowers.
It crushes the leaves
and the stems.
When a predicament approaches
it is the subjects that suffer.
I am not a King
anymore, Vrushali.
I have renounced the kingdom.
Now, I am just like you.
I am merely an ordinary
son of a charioteer.
You shall be safe with me.
Seek the permission to leave
from the Queen Mother.
Go on,
Vrushali.
Maharathi Karna
I would like you
to give my sons this...
Could you kindly
deliver this message
to my sons?
A written message,
Queen Mother!
You must certainly
have faith in me.
My mother has renounced me
but I have not yet
renounced her.
The values and righteousness
imparted to me
have not been forgotten by me.
Let me tell you
what the message is, Karna.
Tell my sons that...
- But think once
before telling me what
the message is, Queen Mother.
I have not yet renounced
my friendship.
Undying dedication to my friend
is still a part of my values.
I have faith
that whatever you do
will be in accordance
with righteousness.
Tell my sons
that a true kingdom
is an independent one.
Only when a gem
emerges from a rock
does it truly shine.
If you seek the refuge
of Hastinapur
you will always be a part
of unrighteousness.
That is why,
you must
earn a flag of your own
kingdom at the earliest.
Only when your kingdom
is independent
will your mother
enter Indraprastha.
If any 'Brahmin
traveller or requester
requires money
then I, son of Adhiratha
Karna, request him
to accept this charity
from me for which
I will be very grateful.
Revered 'Brahmins
will you not accept
charity from me today?
We cannot accept charity
from you, Radheya.
One is prohibited to accept
charity from a 'Shudra.
But yesterday, you had accepted
charity from this very 'Shudra
revered 'Brahmins.
Until yesterday,
you were a King, Radheya.
Being a King is regardless
of one's competence.
A tiger and a cat look similar
but we behave differently
with both of them.
In other words
you were afraid of me.
That if you did not
accept charity from me
I would punish you.
Did you accept the charity
out of this fear?
Think what you may
but why are you
making us engage in this
unrighteous deed now?
We cannot accept the charity
being given by you.
I have merely
renounced my kingdom.
I have not yet
renounced my weapons.
I am still powerful.
I accept your charity,
Maharathi.
Please give me some.
Bless you!
Water stored only in a
baked pot is worth consuming.
An unbaked pot
renders even the water from the
Ganges unfit for consumption.
Similarly
blessings given out of the
fear of weapons is worthless.
And worthless
is the person
giving the blessings.
Revered 'Brahmins
would you clarify
a doubt of mine?
Does a person lacking competence
not entitled to even
engage in religious deeds?
The deeds of one's past life
decide all this.
In his past life
he must have
hurt people immensely.
That is why, he is in pain
in his present life, child.
And after enduring great pain
in his present life
his next life will be
a blissful one.
But what about
the pain you are afflicting
Maharathi Karna in this life?
What will you get
in your next lives,
revered 'Brahmins?
What will you get
in your next lives,
revered 'Brahmins?
Brother Yudhishthir,
you are the King of Indraprastha
but we are being subjected
to injustice here!
You must uphold justice.
Why are you so agitated,
My Lord?
We just got the news
from Hastinapur
that no one is allowed to attend
the reverence of Indraprastha.
Not even the royal family.
Not even mother.
Hastinapur has
imprisoned mother.
The truth is, the entire
kingdom of Hastinapur
has now become a prison
for mother, Panchali.
Does mother-in-law require
permission to take part
in the reverence of our city?
The truth is
that even for the
reverence of a city
one requires
permission, friend.
Fortunately,
His Highness
has already taken that decision.
None of you
are independent to take
a decision on your own.
Obeying the orders of Hastinapur
is your duty.
I am not concerned
about the duties!
That rule applies only to
brother Yudhishthir.
All I know is that
if someone loves you
you must be ready
to die for them.
And the one who is your enemy
deserves to die at your hands!
That is why,
you are so dear to me
brother Bheem.
What do you suggest,
Govind?
It is true
that attacking Hastinapur
would be committing treason.
And it is also true
that this rule
applies only to the King
and
not to the sons of a mother.
Speak clearly,
Madhav.
How can I speak clearly, friend?
She is your mother
it is your kingdom
the weapons are yours
and the duty...
The duty belongs
to all of you as well.
What can we do in such a
situation, brother Yudhishthir?
I cannot order you to attack.
And neither can I lend you
the army of Indraprastha.
But
in order to build
a case for mother
if all of you go to Hastinapur
to request to His Highness
then I cannot stop you
from doing so either.
I cannot stop you
from carrying weapons and
if you have to take to arms
in your defense
then I cannot stop you
from doing so either.
But do remember
that if any of you
is the first one to attack
then I shall
renounce the kingdom.
Maharathi* Karna!
*Great charioteer, great hero/warrior, name of Shiva.
Maharathi Karna
can you ever pardon me?
Pardon you?
For what?
I spoke ill of you
and you renounced your kingdom.
The result was that the insult
you had left far behind
has caught up...
Has caught up to you.
You need not apologize,
Vrushali.
The dilemma is
that in order to be righteous,
I attained my competence
but my competence propelled me
towards unrighteousness.
The truth is
you have opened
my eyes, Vrushali.
How can someone else's behaviour
compel me to leave
my righteous ways?
I am indebted to you.
You are so benevolent
and forgiving,
Maharathi Karna.
I did not know that.
And that
at such a young age
you could have such a deep
understanding of life's truths
is something I was unaware of.
The path that I
was unable to see until now
has been shown to me
by you so effortlessly.
Whoever haves you in his life
would certainly
never lose his way.
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law,
what...
What happened in Hastinapur?!
Sister-in-law...
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!
Do not embrace me,
Subhadra!
You will burn up.
I was housed within
a fire back then
but now, a fire
is burning within me!
I do not wish to see anyone!
No one!
Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law!
Open the door, sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!
Open the door, sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!
Open the door, sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!
My Lord!
How could you let something
so dreadful happen, My Lord?
Sister-in-law has locked
herself up in her chamber.
Sister-in-law has said that
she wishes to see no one.
I made numerous attempts but
she refuses to open the door.
Panchali,
open the door!
Give me the opportunity
for reparation, Panchali.
Open the door!
Brother Yudhishthir
Panchali is
exceedingly agitated.
I hope she does not
set herself on fire.
Brother Yudhishthir,
let me break the door down.
Impossible...
Impossible!
I can even break stone castles
down with my might
but why am I unable to break
this wooden door, brother?
Panchali's resolution has
locked that door, brother
and breaking the resolution
of a heart in agony
is way more difficult
than breaking a castle.
This is Panchali's resolution,
brother.
Open the door,
Panchali!
Panchali,
open the door.
Brother Yudhishthir
we will not be able
to get her to open that door.
Only Madhav can
have it opened now.
Greetings, brother.
Greetings...
I cannot accept your greetings
at the moment, Prince Arjun.
Until Draupadi
pardons all of you
I cannot pardon you either.
Where is my friend?
She left the court
of Hastinapur immediately
and came to Indraprastha
all by herself
leaving all of us behind.
She has locked herself up
in her chamber, brother.
All of us made numerous attempts
but she refuses to open
the doors of her chamber.
She has closed the doors
of her heart, Subhadra.
How can she open the doors
of her chamber then?
Panchali
friends are those
who share the feelings
of their hearts.
I too have a share to the
agony of your heart, friend.
I am here to have
my share of the agony.
Go away,
Govind.
I have been tarnished.
The one who tries to clean this
will also become dirty.
Have faith
in my friendship,
friend.
A person bathing
in the river gets cleansed
but this does not
leave the river dirty.
Govind!
Why, Govind?
Why?
Why did this happen to me?
Such a grave insult!
What sins did I commit,
Govind?
I am reaping the fruits
for which actions of mine?
Whatever happened,
friend
was neither because
of your actions
nor did you reap the fruits
of any action of yours.
That was merely
an unexpected event.
The Kauravas reaped the fruits
of their past actions
by engaging in
such a grave misdeed.
Friend, this is the meaning
of the principle of actions.
A good deed
leads to a better one
while a bad deed
leads to worse deeds
one after the other.
The life of a person
who commits misdeeds
becomes hell,
friend.
But I am experiencing
the agony, Govind.
Then relinquish
that agony, friend.
But I am experiencing
the agony, Govind.
Then relinquish
that agony, friend.
What happened with you
back in Hastinapur
was not because of your actions.
However, the way you will
transform the forthcoming events
will certainly be
your own actions.
If you fill your heart
with sorrow and animosity
then you too
shall experience hell.
However, why should
their misdeeds
make you go through hell?
Relinquish this animosity,
friend.
Calm your heart down.
A river takes all the filth
tossed into it
and pours it into the ocean.
She cleanses herself this way.
You too
need to pour all your agonies
into the hands of the Almighty.
The Almighty is always prepared
to absorb the agonies
of the entire world.
In other words
I must pardon the Kurus
present in the court?
Yes, friend.
Pardon them
otherwise revenge
shall consume you.
You will not be able
to uphold justice.
Revenge,
misdeeds
justice
good deeds...
What is the difference,
Govind?
When they treated the supreme
Empress of the Aryan region
in such a horrendous manner
what will they do to the
ordinary women of the world?
Think about it,
friend.
Try to visualize the pain
of the world in yours.
Transform your sorrows
into a struggle.
Do understand this,
friend.
The one who lets one's
own sorrow consume oneself
becomes weak.
However,
the person
who deems the sorrows
of the society to be his own
becomes strong.
Thinking solely about
one's own sorrow
is a misdeed.
However, looking for a solution
to the problems of the world
is a good deed.
Yes, friend.
I am asking you
to begin first with Duryodhan
and pardon him.
That will be the first step
towards his destruction.
Look for ways to cleanse the
world of evil men like Duryodhan
and others like him.
Not just for yourself
but for the world.
You must fight for the welfare
of the weak men and women
of the society.
In this fight
for humanitarianism
there will be a lot of bloodshed
yet it shall be a righteous war.
So...
Will you be able to do this?
Yes, Govind.
My heart was
filled with darkness
but you have lit the lamp
of knowledge within it.
The fishes shown in this scene

using computer graphics.
Panchali
I threw those dice
with these hands of mine
which reduced my brothers
to the status of servants
and led to the
grave insult of my wife.
Bheem had taken an oath
to burn my hands.
Remember your oath,
Bheem.
Come here
and burn my hands.
No, My Lord.
You need not have
your hands burnt.
I pardon you.
I too must pardon myself,
Panchali
otherwise it will be
impossible for me to live.
Come here,
Vrikodar.
Burn my hands.
I can see that my friend
too, is very angry.
Greetings, Madhav.
Only one with a right
to have a temper can be angry.
I bear no such rights
over you
other than friendship.
I am not the throne, Arjun
whose authority can
be passed on.
My name is Vasudev Krishna.
He who claims his rights
on me
I willingly give him
the rights.
Subhadra's wedding
with Duryodhan...
What's the purpose
of this, Madhav?
His Highness Shakuni
said
that the Kuru
and Yadav clans
need to have an alliance
born of kinship.
How could I oppose
such a noble thought?
It's a conspiracy.
A conspiracy to stop
the Rajsuya Yajna
from taking place
at Indraprastha.
Madhav
it's a tradition.
The royal family
with which an alliance is forged
but isn't bonded together
by kinship
has to be defeated.
That's when the Rajsuya Yajna
can take place.
And we will never come
to defeat Dwarka.
Parth*
*Paartha, "son of Pritha", another name for Kunti.
my purpose wasn't to
break ties with Indraprastha
by getting Subhadra married.
During the Rajsuya Yajna
if Duryodhan attacks
Indraprastha
then you'll have to be
on their side, Madhav.
And we...
We'll have to surrender our
weapons in front of you
Madhav.
You analysed everything
politically, Arjun.
But about
my dear sister Subhadra
you never gave a thought.
I did think of her, Madhav.
You know how unrighteous
Duryodhan is.
How will Subhadra spend
her life with him?
What bliss will she get
at Hastinapur?
You needn't worry
about me.
I will be happy
wherever I go.
No.
Because of me,
my sister eyes
are filled with tears.
Now you will have to defend
me from this problem, Parth.
Me?
- Yes, Parth.
That's the reason
I had told you
that your penance
will be completed
at Somnath.
Brother.
Tell me.
Will you guard me?
Saw that, Prince Arjun
I had told you, that whatever
my brother does
has more than
one interpretation.
But, Madhav, I cannot
marry Subhadra.
It's impossible.
Vikarna
where are uncle
and Dushashan?
I don't know, brother.
I saw them leave
by a chariot.
She has been pledged
to Duryodhan.
So what?
Rukmini too was pledged
to Sishupal.
But Draupadi too was
in this state.
And there were only
two choices then.
Either you brothers would've
fought each other
or any four of you would've
renounced the world.
But Draupadi made way
for the third option.
My friend has done
a lot of favours
for you five brothers.
But here
the circumstances
are different.
And I didn't know that
you were hesitant
to take up arms
against Duryodhan.
Or is the thought of
Duryodhan renouncing the world
breaking your heart?
Call the bride to
the wedding podium.
Go and get Subhadra.
If I abduct Subhadra
then you and brother Balram
will have to fight me.
And I cannot take up arms
against you.
That's true, Parth.
A battle will be announced.
It's a very dreadful
situation.
Subhadra
Parth cannot abduct you.
But, brother, I can
abduct your friend.
Abduct me!
How can you abduct me?
A warrior abducted
by a girl...
This has never happened before.
But, the solution is
an excellent one, Parth.
There's a problem though.
You'll be mocked at.
You will be humiliated.
Give it a thought.
What is your command?
In this world, it is valour that
always abducts love
but I believe
that if love abducts valour
then the world can be
a happier place.
But the final decision
is yours, Parth.
At your behest I had taken up
a woman's guise.
Let me do this too.
Subhadra
you know driving a chariot.
I have kept
the chariot
ready for you.
Brother.
Stay blessed.
Go, Parth.
If the future of the entire
Aryan lineage didn't depend
on this abduction
then I wouldn't have gone
through with this fabrication.
Balram
why is the bride taking
so long to arrive?
I'll send the maids,
Your Highness.
Hurry up, charioteer.
That is Princess Subhadra,
uncle!
Where is she going
with a sage
at this time?
That was Arjun, you fool!
Vasudev Krishna!
You will have to face
the consequences
of this fabrication, Vasudev.
We will have to get
to Dwarka soon.
Prince Balram, it is time
for the wedding ritual.
Get Princess Subhadra to
the wedding podium.
Balram, what's taking long?
Why the delay?
How can she come,
Your Highness?
Because she is far
away from Dwarka.
And unfortunately,
her chariot is running
in the direction
opposite to Dwarka.
King Shakuni!
What are you
trying to say?
Dushashan and I
have seen it ourselves
Prince Balram.
At first, I thought that
the chariot wasn't in control.
But now, Prince Balram,
the question is
if the chariot wasn't in control
or is Princess Subhadra
not in control?
You're forgetting your limits,
King Shakuni.
Um...
And your sister has forgotten
about the honour of Hastinapur.
Keeping the prince of Hastinapur
waiting at the wedding podium
she has renounced Dwarka
and eloped with
someone else.
But why will Subhadra
do such a thing?
Good question.
But you can get the answer
from your younger brother
Vasudev Krishna.
Rudra Yadav, go and see
where Krishna is.
I'm right here, brother.
Ask him, Prince Balram.
Ask him!
Vasudev
at this time,
is Princess Subhadra
in Dwarka?
No, brother.
I have to admit
with great regret
that Subhadra is not in Dwarka
right now.
She isn't in Dwarka!
What do you mean?
Where is she?
When will she return?
Forgive me, Your Highness.
It's a very disgraceful
thing for Dwarka.
I supplicate
and apologise to you
but my sister Subhadra
will now return with her husband
only after her marriage.
She will return after
her marriage!
What are you trying
to attempt, Prince Balram?
To defeat Subhadra's
abductor
and get Subhadra to
the wedding podium
is your responsibility.
You're right, Prince Duryodhan.
Krishna
why isn't the army ready
to attack yet?
I'll get the army ready
right away, brother
but there's a problem.
Who will we fight?
The one who abducted
is without arms
and is a woman.
The warrior who is armed
is the one who
is abducted.
It's a very dreadful situation.
Who has abducted whom?
Reveal this to everyone here
so that everyone is able
to understand
your conspiracy
Vasudev.
- King Shakuni
conspiracy means six kinds
of fabrications.
I have committed only
one fabrication, brother.
I lent my chariot
to my dear sister
so that she could abduct
her husband.
And do you know who she
has chosen as her husband
Your Highness?
Son of Pandu Arjun!
And do you know who she
has chosen as her husband
Your Highness?
Son of Pandu Arjun!
Krishna
because of your plays
I'll have to hide myself
in the womb of the Earth.
Brother, that's certain.
And the place too
is certain.
Prince Balram
the princess had been pledged.
You had given your word
that Duryodhan
and Princess Subhadra's wedding
will be conducted by you.
In a certain sense,
she had been married
then how can she get married
for the second time?
Forgive me, Your Excellency.
If pledging means marriage
then what is the need
for the seven vows?
Pledging means,
the approval of the parents
but a marriage is complete
only after the approval
of the man and the woman.
Pledging cannot be considered
marriage, Your Excellency.
If that's the case
then what is the significance
of giving away the daughter
Vasudev?
The fruit of coconut
falls in the sea
and then the tree renounces its
right on that fruit.
Which bank it will go to
and which land it chooses
to grow as a new tree,
is decided by the fruit
and its fate.
During the giving away ceremony
the parents
renounce their rights
on their daughter.
But who she wants to give
the rights on her
is decided by the girl.
My dear sister Subhadra
also took this decision
and I accepted her decision
on behalf of the Yadavs.
Now you shall only have enmity
with Hastinapur, Vasudev.
Very soon, Hastinapur's army
will attack Dwarka.
Attack!
The son you are about to beget
would inherently possess
my energy and resplendence.
Son?
I, Sage Durvasa, grant
you a mantra
by which you can invoke
any demigod
and summon him to you.
You would be able to beget
a son as glorious as him.
But, Lord... I...
I haven't been married yet.
How can I beget a son?
Then why did you
invoke me, Kunti?
I committed a folly, Lord.
The consequences of the folly
will be borne by you, Kunti.
You will surely beget a son.
Sage Durvasa's curse
has no remedy
and neither can his boon
be any less bountiful.
As soon as I disappear,
a portion of my energy
will stay back with you
in the form of a baby.
I can't stop it from
happening, Kunti.
But what is my father's fault
in this, Lord?
He would be equally defamed.
It would be widely known
that King Kuntibhoj's
daughter's character
is unchaste.
On top of that,
it would also be said
that if a Princess
could beget a son
before being married
then everyone else could.
No one would believe
that it was all due to a boon.
I understand
your quandary, Kunti.
This son of yours
is a result of a boon.
I also give you another boon
that even after giving birth
to a son
you will stay a maiden.
Your character will
remain pure and pious.
Accept this boon earnestly.

Please forgive me, son.
I'm helpless.
Due to my selfish reasons
I can't let my father
be ridiculed by all.
Please forgive me!
Lord Surya
please protect your son.
Don't worry about my son, Kunti.
He is in my sanctuary now.
I have provided him with
a divine armour and earrings.
No power in the universe
can pierce this armour of his.
The gilded sheen of his earrings
will shatter the darkness of his
life and be a guiding beacon.
My son will be
indomitable, Kunti.
He will be known all over
the world as Karna!
Karna!
My son!
My son...
No!
It's best to forget
the past, Princess.
Reminiscing the past
will cause dark clouds akin to
these to loom over your life.
Shall I forget?
How do I just forget,
Priyamvada?
Forsaking one's progeny
doesn't make him the past.
My son...
My son still lives
somewhere.
And till the time he draws
breath
he is my present.
But keeping this matter
a secret is best, Princess.
But from whom?
From the one who
would be my husband?
No, Priyamvada.
Just like flowing water
can't serve as a founding stone
in the very same way
life can't subsist on lies.
But, Princess
after knowing of this truth,
who will agree to marry you?
There must be someone...
There must be someone
for whom
my identity
isn't defined by my folly.
There must be someone
who will
accept me
along with my past.
There must be someone.
Greetings, sister-in-law.
You are welcome,
Your Highness!
You weren't disturbed, were you?
Before setting out for
the task at Kuntibhoj
I have come to
seek your blessings.
May you always be victorious,
Your Highness.
May your fame and glory
have no limits.
May you be successful
in every endeavour.
Can't you address me
just as Pandu, sister-in-law?
Addressing a king by his name
is a crime, Your Highness.
But the term 'Your Highness
coming from you
pierces me like
a thousand thorns!
My heart brims over
with a feeling of guilt!
This throne belonged
to elder brother
and it is...
- No!
Had the throne been
your brother's
it'd have been his.
Since it wasn't so, it clearly
means, the throne is yours.
That was destiny.
Now, you have to become
worthy of the throne.
You had come here to become
the Empress and... - No!
I had come here to become
the wife of your elder brother
and that I am.
Had I come to become
the Empress
I would have married
the throne itself.
How can you be so benevolent?
Because a sister-in-law is
tantamount to a mother
Your Highness.
A mother has just one desire.
That her son
should get everything.
That he should achieve
all the pleasures of the world.
I feel, as if not just a 100
but I have the boon
to have 102 sons.
Promise me, sister-in-law
that when I am seated
on the throne
then and only at that time
would you address me
as 'Your Highness'.
Else, you'd consider me a son
and call me by my name.
Then not just you
but I would call your wife
by her name too.
Now, make haste to
reach Kuntibhoj
and get me my sister-in-law.
I have not laid eyes on you
but I can affirm that no
beautiful damsel of the world
would ever refuse
to be your wife.
Your blessings adorn my luck
which is why I feel confident
but without seeking
brother's blessings
I never start on any task.
This blessing is also on
his behalf, Pandu.
His heart is still
in a state of turmoil.
But he still loves you
as much as he used to.
I believe that, sister-in-law.
My adoration for him
is still the same.
I promise you
my wife and I
would always serve
you and elder brother
till the very end of our lives.
May you be victorious!
My respects to you,
sister-in-law.
My respects too.
The kings and princes
of the Arya region
by gracing the 'swayamvar' of
my daughter Kunti
you have indeed added
to my honour.
It has been the grand
tradition of the Arya region
that a maiden
is given the paramount right
to select her husband.
I request
that the decision
of my daughter Kunti
be heartily accepted by you
regardless of your being
enemies or allies.
You would offer the newlyweds
your blessings
and best wishes.
Come, daughter.
Today, I would
introduce you not to kings
as today, you would
be choosing your fate.
Father, before taking a decision
I would like to ask a question
to all the young men here.
My decision
will be based on the answer
to the same.
Only if you permit me.
- Sure.
In a 'swayamvar',
every maiden
has the right to ask questions
to the kings.
Attending kings and princes
my daughter wishes to clarify
a doubt she has.
The one whose answer
will be deemed most fit by her
will become
my daughter's husband.
I hope no one has any objection.
Prince Ashwakumar may have one,
Your Highness!
Whenever a question about
intelligence crops up
the princes of the Ashwa clan
aren't in the same league as us.
Please don't overstep the maxims
laid out for a 'swayamvar'.
A test of strength isn't
displayed at a court
but in battle.
Who are you?
- I am Hastinapur's Emperor
a son of the Kuru clan...
Pandu.
I beseech you both
to please return to your seats.
I request you to ask
your question.
My question goes thus...
Sage Gautam's wife Ahilya
had had a conjugal relationship
with Lord Indra.
Sage Gautam had punished
his wife.
Then why did Lord Ram
free Ahilya from the same?
By forgiving her mistake,
didn't Lord Ram
set the wrong example
for generations to follow?
The answer to this
is very simple.
The Lord is known
as The Benevolent One.
He can forgive
any sinner.
Then why weren't Bali
and Ravan forgiven?
That's discrimination.
Then why don't you answer
the same?
The answer is...
Every punishment has
its extremes.
Perhaps the Lord
would have felt
that it was time
Ahilya was freed.
But as per me,
the petrified Ahilya
would have repented
for her sins.
No!
The truth is that Lord Indra
had appeared before Ahilya
in the guise
of Sage Gautam.
The conjugal relationship
Ahilya established
was only due to the knowledge
that she was with her husband.
Sage Gautam had cursed
her in a fit of rage
but Lord Ram
was a king.
And a king, before
announcing a sentence
has to mandatorily know
if the punishable deed
is a crime or a folly.
If the intentions aren't wrong
or the nous is pure
repentance and atonement
alone suffice.
There's no need for punishment.
Thinking the same
Lord Ram must have
forgiven Ahilya.
If we do not fail
their incognito exile
then there will
be a war.
Child, don't assume
that during that war
Arjun will fight Karna
and Bhima will fight
with you.
No, my child.
No.
Both the troops
will seek the help
of their other friends
who are kings.
The raging armies
will come together.
There will be horrifying
demolition.
And even if you do win
you will not be
greatly benefited.
A broken kingdom
a shattered empire
poverty
and struggle is all
that you will get.
My child, when there
is famine
not only does the water
on the land dry up
but also one's entire life
too gets dried up.
Hence
stop chanting about
waging a war.
My child
I am living with the aspiration
to make you the king
of a prosperous kingdom.
No war.
Just deceit. Deceit!
King of Sindhu, Jayadratha
Dushasana
send your envoys
to all the states
of the Arya empire.
Send your spies to every corner
of the Arya dynasty.
Find them!
Where have they gone?
Those five powerful men
and the most beautiful
woman in the world
cannot hide
this easily.
Find them!
Go look!
Virat.
Brother, there goes my mace
into its secret hiding.
Now it feels like the incognito
exile has begun.
It will be very difficult for us
to remain in hiding
if all of us are together.
The news of our incognito exile
must have definitely reached
every corner
of the Arya empire.
Everyone must be
looking for a family
with five men
and a woman.
Hence
we cannot stay
together.
We will have a new identity
for the next one year
and we will have to always
keep this new identity in mind.
But, brother, if someone
asks you who you are
then what will your
answer be?
I cannot lie, Bhima.
If someone asks me who I am
I will remain quiet.
Your remaining quit is not
sufficient, brother.
Your being quiet
can reveal our truth.
Can't you lie for just
a year, brother?
Not even for a moment,
Nakul.
Whether lightning strikes
a tree once or continuously
there's no difference.
The tree gets burnt
the first time.
Lie spoken once
harms the soul.
I cannot be defeated
by someone's conspiracy
and break my vow.
- But, brother
if we're caught again
then we'll be exiled again.
Another incognito exile.
This tradition will see no end.
- I know that.
That's the whole idea
behind incognito exile.
But, Sahadeva
if I had to use lies
to be victorious
then why would we
have to be exiled?
Brother Arjun, show us
the way.
Parth*
Arjun other name, Paartha "son of Pritha (Kunti)."
many couples have secretive
names for each other.
Even I give you
a name today.
Here after your name is Mantri Kank.*
*Sage Gold.
And until someone specifically
asks you
if you have another name
beyond Kank
you will introduce yourself
as Kank to everyone.
And when someone
does question you
you will remain quiet.
You can do this, right?
Yes.
If Draupadi has given a name
to her husband
then that will definitely
be my identity.
In the same manner, I will
give all of you a name
and for the coming year
that name will be your
only identity.
No, Draupadi, don't
give me a name.
Madhav has already
given me a name.
What name has he given you?
Brihn! It sounded something
like that, isn't it, Nakul?
I don't remember, brother.
But Vasudeva said
that brother Arjun looks
beautiful with that name.
Why?
What so special about that name?
There's a speciality,
Draupadi.
Now, you will have
to hide your clothes
or else he will
steal them.
Lord Agni, this bow was given
by you as a sacrament.
We're leaving our weapons
in your protection.
After one year
we will come back
to get our weapons
and we will attack
the Kauravas
to destroy them.
Bless us.
Chaitra.'*
*The first month of the year in Hindu calendar.
Your Highness, Pandavas
are not there at Dwarka.
We went to Panchal.
But they weren't there, either.
Where are the Pandavas?
- Our messengers have sent
a message from Naaglok* and Kuntibhoj, brother.
*Naga Loka: Naga/serpent Kingdom (Bheem's drowning location).
Pandavas are not there either.
Pandavas!
Uncle
even the last spy
has returned.
The Pandavas are not there
in any of our
neighbouring kingdoms
that is for sure.
Dwarka
Panchal
Kashi
Naaglok
Madra, Kuntibhoj
every place where
the Pandavas have their family
they haven't gone
even there, uncle.
Where do we look for them?
In heaven!
My child, if they
were in Heaven
then why would we
look for them?
They are hiding
in one of these states
within the boundaries
Arya dynasty.
But where, uncle?
There's only one month left
for the completion
of the incognito exile.
Just 30 days!
I cannot find any other place
where we should look
for them uncle.
No place!
Think properly,
King of Gandhar.
Shakuni!
You are very proud
of your wisdom.
Vasudeva Krishna!
What could he have
thought of
that I have failed
to understand?
What are the things
that a human requires
so he can hide?
New attire
new name
new city
and a new occupation.
- Not occupation, my child.
Not occupation.
One cannot change
his occupation
very easily.
He can only indulge
in the occupation
that he has practise of.
But, uncle
warriors like
Arjun and Bhima...
If they were a part
of any army
then they wouldn't be
able to hide.
Not war!
What are their
other skills?
Nakul
he is the most knowledgeable
when it comes to horse riding.
Think, my child.
Think!
For the last one year
which kingdom's horses
have become the most famous?
Sahadeva.
A cow is the happiest
in Sahadeva's presence.
Think, my child.
Which kingdom's cows
have become famous
in the last one year?
And, Yudhisthira
is a scholar at monarchy.
Find out, my child
which king in the last
one year
has signed a treaty
with other kingdoms?
Think, my child.
Think!
I have heard
that the king of Virat
has signed a treaty
with many kingdoms
of the south.
His kingdom
has been prosperous.
The king has begun
work on making
100 new reservoirs.
Aroma,
odour
and human behaviour
cannot be hidden.
Our spies may have failed
to find them
but, my child
Pandavas
are definitely
in Virat.
In Virat!
Virat.
- Cook Vallabh. - Cook Vallabh.*
*"Beloved."
Please give us a 'ladoo'.
If you have so many 'ladoos
then you'll become fat
like Bhima.
Am I fat?
- He isn't referring to you.
He's referring to Hastinapur's
Prince Bhima.
But he doesn't know
that Bhima
is the most powerful
in the world.
Ladoos' give energy
to Bhima.
I want to become
the best archer in the world
just like Arjun.
- What's so great about archery?
Become strong.
Gain strength.
Here, child
have 'ladoos' prepared
by cook Vallabh.
You will gain strength
and become powerful.
Have one more.
Have them.
Cook, I want one too.
You!
Run away from here.
You want to be an archer!
Run!
Listen, child
take these two 'ladoos' for Tantripal.*
*"Guardian of the calves."
Who's Tantripal?
- There's a man
who is sitting
with the cows.
I'm scared that if he doesn't
get these 'ladoos
he will start feeding on grass.
Here.
Go, child.
Go.
Tantripal...
Tantripal.
Cook 'ladoo' has sent
Vallabh for you.
I mean
cook Vallabh has sent
ladoo' for you.
He himself loves 'ladoo
since childhood.
What? You know him
since childhood?
Don't even ask, child.
Cook Vallabh once gave me a pat
on my back.
Look at what it has
become.
Ladoo'!
These 'ladoos' are delicious.
Child, do one thing.
There's a person
at the stable.
His name is Granthika.*
*"Astrologer, narrator."
Go and give this 'ladoo
to him.
Take it.
Hurry up.
Go.
Before beginning the competition
I welcome such a guest
whom my old eyes deem
of having the potential
of becoming the man
of the millennium
and ushering a righteous era.
Welcome, Vasudev Krishna!
The great Yadava,
Vasudev Krishna.
He is the only person
whom an intelligent person
befriends for life.
Why so, uncle?
Because in the whole of
the Aryan region, he is the one
with whom having any enmity
cannot be afforded by us.
He is way more intelligent
and cunning than me.
Vasudev
I always had
the desire to see you
in my heart.
Greetings, uncle.
You deem me your uncle, Vasudev?
You are the uncle
of my brother Duryodhan.
Hence, I must address you
as my uncle.
No, Vasudev.
No.
I fear in becoming your uncle.
Fear.
Why so, uncle?
I had salvaged my uncle Kansa.*
He imprisoned his own father, Ugrasena (King of Mathura), to usurp the throne; and later imprisoned his sister, Devaki (Krishna's mother) along with Krishna's father, Vasudeva.
I liberated him of his sins.
Greetings, brother Duryodhan.
Bless you, Krishna.
Greetings, Vasudev.
- Bless you, Dusshasan.
And you...
You must certainly be
King Karna of Anga.
By looking at the radiance
on your face
anyone can know
of your competence.
Greetings.
Greetings, Vasudev.
Meeting you is my good fortune.
The whole of the Aryan region
resonates of your righteousness.
Righteousness is such a topic,
King Karna of Anga
that everyone discusses it
but
not everyone can know it.
Then you tell us
what is the path to know
what righteousness is.
Righteousness gives respect,
King of Anga.
If one gets disrespect in
one's life, one must deem
that he did not lead
a righteous life.
And the one
who has got nothing
but disrespect since birth...
What should he do, Vasudev?
He should struggle for respect
but not side
with unrighteousness.
He must certainly
fight for his rights
but not desire something
over which he has no right.
What do you mean?
It means, King of Anga
that even the biggest
of mountains
must not desire a small river.
The mountain which
tries to stop a river
ends up breaking.
The right to a river
resides only with the ocean.
Are you talking about
the strength of the ocean
or the weakness
of the mountain, Vasudev?
I am talking about the fate
of the river, King of Anga.
Hear all!
The most beautiful
and serendipitous
Yajnaseni,* Princess Draupadi is making her entrance!
*Daughter of fire.
When I
like the light
am surrounded by
the joy of knowledge
and everything is novel
all around me
when should I play
oh childhood?
Novel are the pictures
and the light
of bright colours.
Fire is my
fate.
I am Draupadi, who
never experienced childhood.
I am Draupadi, whose
fate is fire.
Bless you.
Such a beautiful woman
ought to become
the Queen of Hastinapur, uncle.
Certainly, my dear.
Certainly.
Truly
she has unparalleled beauty.
Do have a look, King of Anga.
Admiring the beauty
of someone else's wife to be
is inappropriate, Dusshasan.
Besides
if the Princess will be
married to friend Duryodhan
she will have the status
of your mother.
You are correct.
Greetings.
No, friend.
Govind
will Prince Arjun
come to the 'swayamvar?
Govind
will Prince Arjun
come to the 'swayamvar?
I have a feeling, Draupadi
that if he does arrive
you shall know about it
before I do.
Splendid!
Instead of giving alms
everyone has gone
to receive charity.
If you do not get any food
what will become of you,
brother Bheem?
I can even eat
the leaves of a tree
because poison
has no effect on me.
What will become of you, Nakul?
Let's proceed to Kampilya then.
If we stay cautious
no one will recognize us.
No, Sahadev.
There must be another village
here. We should go there.
We must not go to Kampilya.
We have no business being
at the 'swayamvar' there.
Let's proceed.
Hear all!
The son of King Vradyakshen
Susharma, is making his entrance
for the competition!
Hear all!
The son of King Samudrasen
Chandrasen,
is making his entrance
for the competition!
I have firm faith
that there is indeed
a village in this direction.
I see some sages over there.
We should go ask them.
What do you think,
brother Yudhishthir?
L-Let me ask them.
Let me do it.
Greetings, sages.
- Bless you!
In which direction are you
headed, young 'Brahmins?
We are proceeding
towards Naimisharanya
but before we proceed further
we wish to seek some alms.
That is why, we are
searching for a village.
When the King himself
has engaged in charity
then why do all of you need to
seek alms from the villagers?
Let's proceed towards
the city of Kampilya.
One will be rid of
one's poverty for life.
Let's proceed.
Do come with us.
Revered ones,
we are grateful to you
but we..
- Let all this be
and come with us.
Revered ones
do lead the way
and we shall follow.
Alright. As you wish.
- Alright.
Let's proceed in this direction.
Hear all!
The King of Ushneer, Shivi
is making his entrance
for the competition!
Even that King
got defeated, Vasudev.
I have firm faith
that the capability
to win this competition
lies solely with Arjun.
In the entire Aryan region,
this competition can be won
by two people, Your Highness.
The son of Pandu, Arjun
and
the King of Anga, Karna.
But Vasudev
he is the son of a charioteer.
I never oppose any caste
or creed, King Drupad.
The right to respect
belongs to every
competent person.
I am certainly worried that
he is with unrighteous people
but
we cannot stop him from
taking part in this competition.
However...
if marrying Karna
is not what Draupadi wants
then she can
certainly say no to it.
Friend!
The fishes shown in this scene
were generated
using computer graphics.
Is the son of a blind man
blind as well?
Be quiet!
Quit babbling!
Brother Duryodhan,
please calm down!
Go away,
Dusshasan.
Only this fire can extinguish
that burning in my heart.
Go away!
Please order
brother-in-law Duryodhan
to lay down his weapons.
Take the weapons away from
Duryodhan and the King of Anga.
Is the son of a blind man
blind as well?
Is the son of a blind...
- Duryodhan and King of Anga.
Is the son of a blind...
- Please order brother-in-law...
Duryodhan and the King of Anga.
- To lay down their weapons.
Father, brother Duryodhan
has set his entire room on fire!
What!
Set his room on fire!
Why, Dusshasan?!
What caused him to do this?!
Upon seeing the court
of the Pandavas
brother had become
exceedingly agitated, father.
You must come with me
at once, father!
Let's go, father.
Friend, the reply
to an insult is revenge
and not killing oneself!
The Pandavas will have to
set themselves on fire, friend!
You need not
set yourself on fire.
You...
You need to calm down.
Please calm down.
Go away,
friend Karna!
Living on this earth now
cannot give me any peace!
My heart is burning
like the bed of the ocean!
Go away!
Duryodhan!
The fire of the ocean
does not burn itself up, son!
That fire is blanketed in water!
Have the strength
to be patient, Duryodhan.
How can I possibly
be patient, father?
The wood of this room
is not burning here!
My respect,
my pride
and the emotions of my heart
are burning here!
That daughter of Drupad
had snatched the weapons
from your son
in the court before everyone!
The insult a woman feels
when being disrobed
is nothing compared
to the insult
experienced by a warrior
when his weapons
are snatched from him!
Karna...
My friend Maharathi Karna
had requested them
not to take away our weapons
but to sentence us
to death instead!
However, those Pandavas
paid no heed, father!
With the intent of insulting us
in some way or the other
they had conducted
the Rajsuya 'Yajna!
And despite being disgraced
I was a part of that 'yajna.
I was cursing my fate
during that ceremony.
Apart from killing myself
those Pandavas have left me
with no other alternative,
father!
No other alternative...
Son, killing oneself is not
the solution to any problem.
We will discuss
this matter calmly
but please,
let's go from here!
No, father!
No!
- Karna...
Karna, say something
to your friend!
Your Highness
I cannot bear to see
my friend in pain.
The solution to this problem
lies solely with you.
More than the sons of Pandu
you are chaser to him, Karna.
When it comes to your
dedication and competence
I have never questioned
their sincerity, dear.
Please guide us
to extinguish the fire
in Duryodhan's heart!
Blinded by the arrogance
in creating Indraprastha
the Pandavas have insulted
my friend, Your Highness!
Just give me the order.
I will defeat the Pandavas
and annex Indraprastha
to Hastinapur!
Go ahead and attack.
Dear Duryodhan,
I give the order
to go ahead and
attack Indraprastha
but please give up the thought
of setting yourself on fire.
Extinguish this fire.
Extinguish...
- No, father!
The question is no longer about
Indraprastha and Hastinapur!
It is not about two empires!
It is a personal matter now.
The excruciating pain
in my heart will subside
only when I will make
those five brothers
go through the same agony!
I do not wish to
merely defeat them, father.
I wish to insult them.
A tiny spark
on a pillow made of cotton
eventually
reduces it to ashes.
That fire cannot be extinguished
despite numerous efforts.
It burns every particle
of that cotton pillow!
This is the kind of insult
that should set
their bodies, hearts
and lives on fire,
father!
It should set them on fire!
Without laying
a finger on someone
the act of draining that being
completely of blood
can be achieved only by uncle,
brother Duryodhan.
But you insulted him.
That is why,
he returned to Gandhar.
Uncle
are you forsaking me?
When baby birds
are old enough to fly
their parents stop feeding them.
You are capable enough.
You can shove me
out of your way.
Now, to me
returning to Gandhar
is the only alternative.
Move forth,
charioteer.
Uncle
I had shoved you with this arm
and now,
I shall cut it off!
But you cannot leave today.
Please pardon me,
uncle
and let us proceed
towards Hastinapur
otherwise...
- Let it be, dear.
Let it be.
You have learnt the art
of shedding crocodile tears
from me after all
and it will have
no effect on me.
Uncle
then go ahead and punish me.
Any mode of atonement you say
shall be honoured by me.
If you tell me
to serve the Pandavas for a year
I will certainly do it
but uncle
you cannot leave.
I need you.
Not just for a year
but even if I ask you
to serve them your entire life
the punishment
will be inadequate
for you
and that would
not be a punishment
for insulting me.
It would only be one
for your foolishness.
Uncle
when the wheel of a chariot
attempts to outrun it
it is bound to fall.
The chariot may get
another wheel
but the wheel does not
get another chariot.
This is the kind of foolishness
I have exhibited, uncle.
Uncle
I join my hands before you
and take the oath
that henceforth,
if I disobey you
it will be an invitation
to my death.
Uncle
I join my hands before you
and take the oath
that henceforth,
if I ever disobey you
it will be an invitation
to my death.
I hope, unlike your
foolish friend Karna
you will not speak of
engaging in a war.
I have always felt
that wars are worthless.
You know quite well
that a plan should be such
where we must not
end up getting hurt
but the enemy
should end up losing everything.
Uncle!
Uncle
I am not asking for
a war this time.
I wish to insult them.
Insult!
If you snatch everything
from a person
but not his pride
then it will not benefit you.
Every year,
the winter season
snatches the leaves
from the trees
but foolish is the season
which does not
chop the roots off.
That is why,
every year
new leaves grow on the trees.
The way
the roots of a tree
give nourishment to it
similarly
the pride of people
strengthens them.
If you wish
to insult the Pandavas
then do you have the desire of
breaking their pride, darling?
Then take all that anger out
not on the Pandavas
but on their wife
Panchali
by channelling it towards her.
Panchali
is the pride of the Pandavas.
She signifies their dignity.
When Panchali's respect shatters
the life of the Pandavas
will be in ruins!
Uncle, that laugh of Panchali
is still resonating in my ears!
I wish to obliterate
that joy from her face!
Forever...
This is
a different circumstances.
How does the current situation
any different, mother?
Sons,
King of Anga...
Karna, King of Anga...
Karna, King of Anga...
Karna, King of Anga has
showed the largest examples
involved in charity.
He gave away
part of his own body as a charity.
He gave away his shield as a charity.
As a warrior he is worthy to die on
the battlefield
and not in the camp of treatment.
Moreover, a better chance to slay him
now rest with Arjun.
If King of Anga die for what 
he thinks is right
then he will not be punished for
his improper conduct,
Nakula.
Mother's right.
Nakul, Sahadev
you two have to go to the rescue
King of Anga life's.
But brother Yudhishthir
we also need to go to welcome
uncle Shalya.
This is more important,
Sahadev.
King of Madra
will be welcomed in Kurukshetra by me.
Greetings, King Shalya.
Who had set up camp in the middle
of the road?
Who holds such important
that the road to the main camp has
been hampered?!
In order to welcome you, we do not
just block the road
but also holds our breath, Your Majesty.
And in this war
if you help us by agreeing to fight
for our side
it will be like the help of Lord
Shiva himself
Majesty.
This way, Majesty.
Where are my nephews, 
Nakul and Sahadev?
All hail King Shalya!
All hail King Shalya!
All hail King Shalya!
Majesty, all the princes are busy
preparing for war.
They are here at Kurukshetra.
They may not have time.
Your Majesty, we are here 
to welcome you.
The king is here?
Where is he? 
- He's in the camp.
He has been waiting for you,
Majesty.
This way, Majesty.
All hail King Shalya!
All hail King Shalya!
Son!
Prince Nakula,
Prince Sahadev,
I bow before your knowledge.
Our holy herbs can not cure our
enemies more than this.
We will soon be venerating your corpse
Karna, King of Anga.
Mother,
let's go.
We must proceed towards our camp.
No, sons.
Until I live
I stayed in the camp of
Hastinapur, sons.
Mother,
if you stay with the enemy
you may then live in danger during
the war.
It is not right to trust the enemy
under any circumstances.
Do not worry, Prince Sahadev.
Just like a son
I will protect your mother.
Mother,
before the war's started, we will come 
to seek your blessings.
Let us go, Nakula.
Uncle Shalya must have arrived.
Uncle!
Uncle,
this is not our camp.
This camp belongs to our enemy.
I'm sorry, my dear nephews
but now, even I is an enemy to you.
This evil man
son of Dhritarashtra is just a wily fox who
have deceived me!
He made me to promise to help them,
dear nephews.
Making you promise!
But why did you make a promise
like that, uncle?!
What situation could it be
that you make a promise like that?!
I thought King Yudhishthira was welcoming me
and their praises left me blind.
Unknowingly
I promise to give them my help.
I was bound by my promise,
dear nephews.
And now, I have to fight along with
these evil people!
All around the world a brother
assume their sibling's children
equivalent to hundreds of 'Brahmin!
Then how can you leave
your sister's children, uncle?
For me, the two of you more than 
my own children.
Sahadev,
Nakula,
my prayers will always be with 
the Pandavas.
But I am helpless in this case.
That wicked Duryodhana
has shown that low values
are part of himself!
His blind father
only worthy for
begging outside the temple!
And these are the values given 
by their mother
to these devils!
His blind father
only worthy for
begging outside the temple!
And these are the values given 
by their mother
to these devils!
King Shalya! 
- My dear!
Stay within your limits!
Calm, my dear.
Relax.
King Shalya
using derogatory words like that
for my brother-in-law and sister
is unlike people like you.
Are you angry, Shakuni?!
You deceitful man!
Come forward
and let us have a duel here!
No, King of Madra.
I'm not your lover
that your sour words
would hurt my heart.
There will be a duel...
You will be involved in a duel
with your two nephews
on the battlefield.
I am going to have a duel with you!
And I will slay you, uncle Shalya.
I will kill you for this betrayal.
And uncle Shakuni
this scam must be yours.
So remember this oath,
you will be killed in this war!
And it will be in my hand!
Let's go, Nakul!
Whether King of Madra will be
punished or not
is not an important thing, Nakula.
At this time
we can not get angry or 
think about revenge.
We only have seven 'akshauhini' army
while they have eleven 
great 'akshauhini' army!
This problem is more important.
We must have someone who can help
in the beginning.
Grandsire Bhisma
Guru Drona
King of Anga
Crown Prince Duryodhana
Susharma
and now
even the King of Madra.
When all of these soldiers
wreak havoc on our troops
that our soldiers' Maharathis
will be completely absorbed in
protecting our troops.
We will not even get a chance to
attack.
If you all
remove yourself from the attachment
anger and fear
and fight with all your heart
for the establishment of truth
then, have faith that
our army will stand without 
we even notice it.
The strength of a maharathi
rest in his heart
and not in the strength of his army.
In order to win in this war
praying for the death of 
his excellency Bhisma
is your duty.
In order to win in this war
praying for the death of 
his excellency Bhisma
is your duty.
His excellency's death?
But... 
- But what, friend?
His excellency is Kaurava 
army general.
Protecting the Crown Prince
Duryodhana of Hastinapura
is an oath he had taken.
Until he continues to fight 
in this war
our victory is impossible.
You have taken an oath to
establish truth,
and sacrifice
is the primary basis of truth.
And more important than life
is sacrificing it.
And sacrifice of love and
affection
which seems to be more important
than life itself
is very important.
Is it a fist of arrogance
or a cupped palm of sacrifice
that you have assumed?
Can you digest this fact?
What is this world, Arjun?
Humans, demons, animals, birds
parasites, insects,
fishes, trees.
How are all these created?
What substance
are they created from?
How do they function
and how do they survive?
How do they die?
And what happens after death?
Ponder upon this secret.
A human body is made from dirt,
Krishna.
Water flows through it
as blood and other humours.
Fire gives the body heat.
And the blank voids in the body
consist of space.
Therefore, earth, wind, water,
fire and space...
The body is created from
these five base elements.
Therefore, Grandsire Bhishma,
Master Drona
are nothing more than earth,
water, wind
fire and space.
Even the learned scholars are
comprised of five base elements
and so are the tyrants.
So, what are you pining for,
Arjun?
For dirt?
But Krishna, it is through this
body made of dirt
that humans assume
their identities.
All bonds are rooted
in this body made of dirt.
No, Arjun!
If this were true
then why is one's body
destroyed post death?
In reality
neither is one's
identity from his body
nor are his relationships
rooted in his body.
One's behaviour and his nature
and his deeds are his identity.
How are behaviour, nature
and deeds even created?
Comprehend that, Arjun!
A human life
is a mere harmony of visible
and invisible entities, Arjun.
Yet every human's nature
and his deeds
seem to vary vastly.
The reason for it is the three 'Gunas'* of nature.
*Operational principles or tendencies.
Tamas',* 'Rajas'** and 'Sattva'***.
*Negative, lethargic, dull, or slow. **Change, movement or dynamism. ***Balance, order, or purity.
What are these three properties,
Krishna?
Tamas' means darkness.
Spending one's life without
presuming about good or bad
is said to be 'Tamas' oriented
behaviour.
Just as birds and animals live
solely to fulfill
their bodily cravings.
Sattva' means
the light of knowledge.
When a person,
in every circumstance
thinks about justice, truth
and tradition before acting
then it is termed as
Sattva' oriented way of life.
Amidst these two
is such a person
who does possess knowledge
but he is also tethered to
the desires of body and mind.
Such a person lives
with an arrogant
which means, 'Rajas' oriented
mindset.
By the very balance
of 'Tamas', 'Rajas
and 'Sattva' 'Gunas
a man's nature is determined.
Look ahead, Arjun!
What 'Gunas' do you see
in all of them?
Prince Duryodhan
knows what is just
but he never acts upon them.
His life revolves around
arrogance.
Therefore, he possesses
less of 'Tamas'.
He possesses more of 'Rajas
and 'Sattva' is totally absent.
And over there
is Prince Dushyasan.
He has always obeyed
his elder brother's orders
without any forethought.
Therefore, he possesses
only 'Tamas'.
Look at Grandsire Bhishma
as well, Arjun.
He possesses balanced amounts
of 'Sattva' and 'Tamas'.
He harbours no arrogance.
But he is bound by outdated
thoughts and old traditions.
Even when the need arises
he cannot break his oath.
Look at
Master Drona!
He possesses both knowledge
and arrogance.
Knowledge liberates a human.
But his arrogance
won't let him attain liberation.
But Krishna
if a human's nature is the union
of these three 'Gunas
is a human's actions
predestined?
That a lion shall
devour a gazelle
and a gazelle is bound to
fear a lion.
Then why is justice vital?
Why do crimes need
to be punished?
What is the purpose of that?
A brilliant question, Arjun!
But first comprehend what
a human being is!
A human isn't just the union
of the five base elements.
Not just five entities.
Five 'Gyanendriyas',* five 'Karmendriyas'**
*Sensory organs: Akshi (The Eyes), Karna (The Ears), Nasika (The Nostrils), Jihwa (The Tongue), Twacha (The Skin). **
and three 'Gunas'...
Not even just the union
of 23 such entities.
In order for a human
to walk around function
he needs energy.
And energy is termed as 'Chetana'.*
*Chaitanya: 'consciousness' or 'universal CHUT' or 'spirit' or 'intelligence' or 'sensation'.
So, Krishna, is a human
comprised of 'Chetana'?
No, Arjuna!
Along with a human's 'Chetana
the union of those 23 entities
is creation.
Residing in this device called
human made of 24 entities
is a 'man', which means
a fragment of God.
That is termed the soul.
When the creation and man
become one
which means,
when a fragment of God
resides in one's body as a soul
that is when a human
comes to life.
What is a soul, Krishna?
And what is the means
of comprehending it?
Just as a human uses a chariot
similarly the soul uses
this device called a body.
Through the medium of a body
it experiences the joys
and sorrows of the body.
But the soul is not the body,
Arjun.
The body can be destroyed.
But a soul cannot be destroyed.
"Nainam chhindanti shastrani,
nainam dahati pavakah"
"na chamam kkadayanti apo,
na sosayati marutah."
A soul can neither be pierced
by weapons
nor can it be burnt with fire.
Nor can water render it weak,
nor can the wind dry it.
Even though a soul resides
in the body
it is immortal!
"Na hanyak: hanyamane sharire."
Arjun, a body can be killed
but the soul cannot
be killed!
A soul is omnipresent,
intangible, stable.
It is eternal.
Just as a man discards
old garments and wears new ones
similarly the soul leaves
an old body
and assumes a new body
time and again.
But, Krishna
I experience the world
through my body.
Without understanding
my very body
how can I understand my soul?
Knowing oneself
in the form of a soul
isn't impossible either,
Arjun.
Even the blind ones live.
Even the mute ones live.
Those who do not have
hands or legs live too.
It is clear that the body
is not what makes a human.
The ones who loses his energy
or loses his consciousness
lives as well.
Therefore it is clear
that a man's unconscious form
isn't the body either.
The one who explores within
himself in this way...
I am neither the 'Indriyas'*, nor the body
*Indriyadhisthana: the prime location of sensory perception (gayanendriyas).
nor the feelings,
nor the thoughts
nor am I the thoughts.
The one who understands this
finally understands himself
in the form of a soul.
What is the purpose of a soul,
Krishna?
When the creation
was partitioned
and when man and nature
were created
then the man, that is the
fragment of God became a soul
and dwelled within every
entity of creation.
That soul was surrounded
by desire and darkness, Arjun.
Awakening from that
slumber of desire
and understanding oneself
as the fragment of God
is the duty, purpose and
the goal of a soul.
But Krishna, if every soul
is a fragment of God
are progress and hindrance
controlled by God himself?
Just as a jewel lying in dirt
does not shimmer
similarly
the soul that is surrounded by
creation's 24 entities learns
that it is the fragment of God.
Very often souls assume that
their bodies are everything.
That they are different
from the body itself
is never known to them.
The joy, sorrow, smell, taste,
etcetera that the body senses
they assume them
to be their experiences
and they never strive
for change.
The souIs that do not
strive towards change
and are constantly
committing injustice
punishing them to awaken them
is inevitable.
You better comprehend this
as well, Arjun
that you are not a body
but a mere soul.
Every warrior seen
in this battlefield
isn't what you think he is.
They have all dwelt within
a body for a time period.
Their bodies shall die
But they are all immortal!
They shall assume new bodies
again.
Until they do not know
themselves as pure souls
until they give up injustice and
imbibe justice into themselves
they shall continue to be born
and die.
This is the first lesson of 'Bramha Vidya',* Arjun!
*Knowledge of the mantra/absolute.
The one who is born
shall surely die.
And the one who dies
shall surely be born again.
This great knowledge is called 'Sankya yoga'!*
*Samkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities; Purusa (consciousness) and prakriti (phenomenal realm of matter). Jiva is that state in which purusa is bonded to prakriti through the glue of desire, and the end of this bondage is moksha.
What are justice and injustice,
Krishna?
The path treading which a man
sees himself as a soul
and knows himself
to be a fragment of God...
That path is called justice.
When a man and knows himself
to be a fragment of God
he has an epiphany
that creation is God
and God is creation.
There is no difference
between creation and God!
The human who comprehends this
isn't cruel and harsh towards
other humans and animals.
He knows that amputating
an organ causes pain
not just to that organ.
The pain is experienced
by the entire body.
Similarly, when one human
feels pain
the entire world
experiences that pain.
As long as even a single human
is suffering in this world
no one can feel true pleasure
to the fullest until then.
When upon knowing this
a human mind
is filled with compassion
it is called justice.
When one is under the influence
of 'Tamas' 'Guna
he becomes harsh, cruel and
selfish towards others!
Just for the sake of his
perceived pleasure
he inflicts sorrow upon others.
He cannot grow closer
towards God.
Therefore
injustice is the path that
leads away from God.
Therefore, injustice is another
name for ignorance.
So, one needs to feel pity
towards an ignorant one.
What is the purpose
of punishment?
When an ignorant one
is unwilling
to know the value of knowledge
and is unwilling to even glance
at knowledge
then punishment is compassion
even towards him
and towards others as well.
For the creation's progress
to be always towards God
is inevitable!
But at times situations arise
when ignorance, desire
and injustice grow
and justice in the world
is at the brink of extinction
and the world is devoid
of justice
compassion and truth
are both destroyed.
In order for the forthcoming
generations to get justice
slaying unjust ones today
and re-establishing justice
is inevitable!
Today is a similar situation,
Arjun!
And the duty to establish
justice is yours!
Hence overcome your weakness
and prepare for this battle!
But murders shall occur
at my hands, Krishna!
If lives are ended by me
won't that destroy
the compassion within me?
And if compassion
is the basis of justice
won't my soul become unjust?
The limit of justice
is surely created.
But the limit of actions
isn't created, Arjun.
The difference between
actions and deeds
is necessary to be understood.
All deeds are actions,
but all actions aren't deeds.
A deed is an action
for which an outcome
is expected.
When one carries out a deed
expecting pleasure,
wealth and praise
he is bound by the outcome
of that action.
When a deed is performed with
an expectation of an outcome
it is called 'Sakam Karma Yoga'.*
*Self-centred action.
And when a deed is carried out
without expecting an outcome
it is called 'Nishkaam Karma Yoga'.*
*Self-less or desireless action: action performed without any expectation of fruits or results, and the central tenet of Karma Yoga path to Liberation.
This is the very reason
he has to be born repeatedly.
In reality a man isn't
bound by a deed.
The expectations linked to
that deed is what bounds him.
Who is the real
King of Panchal, Drupad?
You have been defeated,
Kuru Prince!
The 104 brothers of yours
have also been captured!
Today, your grandfather
will be very proud
upon knowing of your capability!
Did your teacher
not teach you how to navigate
through this discus formation?
This is the discus formation
of King Drupad!
King Drupad's discus formation!
I will not kill you!
I will have your head shaved
and a donkey will be your ride
back to Hastinapur!
But before that
your grandfather
will have to come here!
Bhishma will have to come here!
Bhishma!
My daughter Shikhandini
will avenge my father's defeat.
On one hand, there are
the lives of the 105 Princes!
And on the other
the life of Bhishma!
Your Majesty,
they are just 100 Princes.
How is that possible?
The messenger had said that
105 Princes were coming
to fight in the battle!
Where are the other five?
Arjun, only you can navigate
through this discus formation.
You shall lead.
- As you say.
Not from there,
brother Yudhishthir.
From the West.
Brother Bheem, Nakul, Sahadev
do not enter from the gates.
The soldiers have
formed a fortress.
There is no
visible entrance, Arjun.
More soldiers?
Does no one know
anything about fighting?
Come here...
Come here.
Friend, those soldiers
are my enemies.
But their horses are my friends.
Tell them to let me through.
This is my discus formation!
Enter it, if you can!
Arjun, you need to
find a way out of this.
We must get back
to our brothers.
Do you remember
what mother said?
Together, we are indestructible.
If I knew, there would be
so many soldiers
I would have had a bigger meal.
Now, I need to have
a big meal after the battle.
Brother Bheem
did you defeat
just these many soldiers?
But I did not fall.
Then here you go.
Let's go, Nakul.
Drupad and the Kauravas
must be in there
surrounded by the soldiers.
We need to go there.
Sahadev, free all our brothers.
Must I do this?
Do not say that, Sahadev.
They are our brothers.
Them being captured
is our defeat.
Duryodhan, start freeing
the rest of our brothers.
We do not require your help.
Our father can free us.
Duryodhan, 105 of us
Kuru Princes have come here.
We need to be victorious
as a team.
We are the Kauravas
and you five are the Pandavas.
Never forget this.
Besides
if we could not
find a way out of this
then how will the five of you
figure it out?
Besides
if we could not
find a way out of this
then how will the five of you
figure it out?
Nakul!
Accept your defeat, King Drupad.
King Drupad who?
Are you certain Kuru Prince
that I am the King of Panchal
Drupad?
Or maybe I am
the King of Panchal, Drupad!
King Drupad who?
Are you certain Kuru Prince
that I am
the King of Panchal, Drupad?
Or maybe I am
the King of Panchal, Drupad!
Or maybe I am.
Even I can be him.
You have been defeated, Prince!
What is this?
Brother Krishna said,
if you keep this with you
it will be of use to you
in the battle.
Did Krishna send these stones
to me for this very moment?
Do the five stones
symbolize the five Drupads?
Only one of the stones has
the eye right at the center
indicating that only one
of the Drupads is real.
In other words,
he is the real King Drupad.
Not one but five Drupads.
Your illusion of the Five Gems
was fantastic, Your Majesty.
However, had you
advised your look-alikes
not to steal glances at you
for their next order
then maybe you would
have been successful.
But do remember, Arjun.
This task will be exceedingly
difficult for you.
The truth is, this task will be
quite gruesome for you.
If you wish, you may test me.
- Test you?
Alright.
Then let's go.
We will move northward first
and then proceed to the East.
Subhadra
you should proceed
to the palace now.

Kanhaiya is quite frisky
but this flute playing darling
can also be very naughty.
The one who pesters
the maidens of Bra") is He
and hence, the maidens
chase Girdhar Murari.
Murli Manohar
Mohan Murari.
In every form of yours
the things you do are lovely.
Kanhaiya is kind...
Kanhaiya is a kind buddy,
unparalleled in the world
never oblivious to agony.
To help man, he is ever ready.
Wondrous are
the deeds of Murari.
Labour seems to have
magnified my strength, Madhav.
No, friend.
Helping that man has
magnified your strength.
Helping people always
magnifies one's strength.
Let's go, friend.
- 'Murli Manohar
Mohan Murari.
In every form of yours
the things you do are lovely.
In every form of yours
the things you do are lovely.
So, this is Kundanpur.
It is far more prosperous
than I had heard of.
Indeed, friend.
This is the capital of Vidarbha.
And over there you can see
the palace of
the King of Vidarbha.
The main entrance is over there.
Then why have we come here?
Friend, we have
come here because
we need to enter the city.
But we cannot take
the main entrance
because it will be guarded
by the soldiers of Vidarbha.
But Madhav, you said
you were invited to the wedding.
I wasn't invited to be
a part of the wedding, friend.
I have been invited here
as the groom.
The marriage
of Princess Rukmini
has been arranged with
the Prince of Chedi, Shishupal.
The entire region of Arya
know about it.
But Rukmini will be
married to me
but you are fortunate
because only you know about it
in the entire Aryan region.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Read it, friend.
Srutva Gunan Bhuvana-Sundara
Srinvatam Te.
What is this?
A letter, friend.
A love letter.
Who wrote it?
The Princess of Vidarbha,
Rukmini.
Bhuvana-Sundara!
The most beautiful in the world!
Who, Madhav?
Me, friend.
Who else?
Tan Me Bhavan Khalu
Vritah Patir Anga Jayam.
I... I have accepted you
as my husband!
Vidarbhan Guptah Sametya.
She asks you to come
to Vidarbha secretly.
Is this why you have
brought me here
instead of the main entrance?
We need to enter
the city secretly, friend
for the purpose of marriage.
We need to enter
the city secretly, friend
for the purpose of marriage.
But...
If a father has not
organized a 'swayamvar
is it right to abduct
his daughter, Madhav?
Whether a 'swayamvar
is organized or not
abducting a woman
against her wishes
is always wrong, friend.
The truth is, every living being
has the freedom to live his life
on his own terms
and it's a God-given right.
And snatching this freedom
is indeed wrong, friend.
And today, this wrong deed
is being committed
by Rukmini's brother.
I am merely going to save a
woman from this misdeed, friend.
Then give me the order, Madhav.
The mere sound
of my bow being plucked
will shatter the fortress
of Vidarbha!
This is what I was
afraid of, Arjun.
This is what I fear.
Rukmini has instructed
clearly in the letter
that her family members
should not get hurt.
We cannot engage
in a battle with them.
Besides, friend.
When eloping is easier
why engage in violence
unnecessarily?
You need to meet Rukmini
secretly and tell her
that as mentioned in the letter
I will wait for her in
the temple of Goddess Parvati.
Meet her secretly, Madhav?
What disguise will we be in?
Yes!
Disguise...
I will dress up as a cowherd.
I have quite the practice
in being one.
And what about me, Madhav?
Stop!
What have you got there?
Some 'kheer.
It's a sacrament.
Who are you?
I am Gopal.
The one who raises cows.
No one is allowed
to enter this place.
People are not allowed to enter?
Yes.
Alright.
Sire, I have got it now.
That Yadava...
Krishna!
He has tarnished the reputation
of us cowherds.
He has committed such deeds
that even heavily armoured
soldiers like you
are afraid of us cowherds.
It's alright.
- We are not afraid.
Then may I g-go
and deliver this 'kheer?
To Prince Shishupal.
Alright.
You can enter.
But you need to be back soon.
As you say, sire.
Thank you.
As you say.
Come here!
Brihannala!
Who is she?
She is my sister, sire.
Her name is Brihannala.
She is taller and bigger
than most women.
Hence, our mother
named her Brihannala.
Let's go.
Madhav.
What kind of a disguise
is this, Madhav?
I had told you, friend
this task is going to be
quite gruesome for you.
Better get used to it.
Who knows when it might just
come in handy to you.
And even the name of Brihannala.
Friend
that is Rukmi.
Rukmini's elder brother.
The Crown Prince of Vidarbha.
We should ask him as to where
Rukmini's chamber is.
What are you saying, Madhav?
He will find out about
your true identity.
Even you don't know
my true identity, friend.
Then he has no chance
of knowing it.
Hold this.
Prince! Give me
your blessings, Prince!
Bless you.
Who are you?
Prince, the great sage Durvasa
has sent this sacrament.
As he is busy
with another undertaking
he will be unable
to attend the wedding.
So, he has sent this sacrament
for the groom and the bride.
Alright. Give that to me.
- N-No, Prince.
He had said that only the groom
and the bride can touch it
otherwise it will
get unsanctified.
Alright.
Deliver it yourself.
Deliver it myself, Prince?
Prince, my sister Brihannala.
She can deliver the sacrament
to the Princess
but only if you permit it.
Alright but not right away.
She can deliver it to the
chamber upstairs after a while.
To that chamber?
As you say, Prince!
Madhav, you touched his feet!
Friend, he is Rukmini's
elder brother.
So, I had to touch his feet.
Besides, who knows
whether in the future,
we will get his blessings
or not.
Was that sacrament really sent
by the great sage Durvasa?
Are you doubting me, friend?
It was indeed sent by him.
His hermitage is very
close-by to Dwaraka.
I had asked for it for the groom
and the bride myself.
Hold this.
Friend, I am the groom.
Hence, I was bound
to consume this sacrament.
Now, you must go.
Bring Rukmini to the temple
of the Goddess in three hours.
I shall be waiting for you.
- 'Murli Manohar
Mohan Murari.
In every form of yours
the things you do are lovely.
In every form of yours
the things you do are lovely.
Have all five of you brothers
got married?
Uncle
we five brothers
have got married to Draupadi.
One...
One woman
and five husbands!
Hastinapur
and its doctrine!
Unrighteousness!
I was awaiting the advent
of righteousness
and you five brothers
have committed this blasphemy,
Yudhisthir.
The throne
that is stained even
by withered flowers...
On that pious place
you wish this sin
and this overt muck
to be glorified on it?
Grandsire...
- Arjun!
Uncle...
Come, nephews, follow me.
Yudhisthir's right
has been stifled.
Look at this balance.
A side of it has
the Pandavas' righteousness
all their good deeds.
We tried poisoning Bheem
and they forgave us.
You asked for the first chance
in the war with Panchal
and they gave you that.
We tried burning
them down in Varnavat
and they forgave us yet again.
At every step,
they upheld righteousness
displayed exemplary character
but...
- But
today just one misdeed
of theirs
has ruined
all their good deeds, uncle.
Just like this.
It seems now as if
God is with us.
You are right, friend.
In this unrighteous world,
maybe God and human
have to choose between
the severity of unrighteousness.
Now you have understood.
You thought of my deeds
as being unrighteous
but now
just have a gander at who
weighs the more in immorality.
I distrusted them right from
the start.
If they pretend to be so good
then surely
their hearts...
Must be maligned with
some heinous sin.
Uncle
what do we have to do now?
What do we...
What do we have to
do indeed, dear?
We just have to relax.
All that has to be done
will be done by that old man.
My dears
every tide that swells up
the ocean
when is dirtied by the sand
is consumed by the ocean itself.
Now Bhishma will announce your
kingship in Yudhisthir's stead.
King Duryodhan!
King Duryodhan!
- Hail him!
King Duryodhan!
- Hail him!
King Duryodhan!
- Hail him!
Grandsire...
Grandsire.
The Pandavas' decision
has many reasons behind it.
Sister-in-law, unknowingly
assigned Draupadi to
all the brothers.
Had Draupadi married
a single Pandava
the other four had to
become recluses.
In Kampilya
such situations arose
that... - That they had to
bow to unrighteousness!
They had to resort
to such blasphemy!
What such could be
a situation, Vidur
that makes unrighteousness
and blasphemy acceptable?
How?
How on earth?
Till a human being has
a way of adopting solitude
why would he resort to
unrighteousness or blasphemy?
Had Yudhisthir become a recluse
we'd have had to make
Duryodhan the king.
What difference
does it now make?
If anyone among
them becomes the king?
My Hastinapur will surely
face a downfall.
Righteousness will surely
be ruined.
Vidur
for years, I have safeguarded
this throne.
I have struggled incessantly
to ensure righteousness prevails
in Hastinapur.
Despite many challenges,
I was patient
because a hope lingered
in my heart
that a day...
A day would come when
God shall lend me a hand.
The demise of Vichitravirya
the battle with Lord Parashuram
the forest exile of Pandu
and then...
Pandu's demise.
Duryodhan's birth
the solitude
of Queen Mother Satyavati.
I...
Even after all this,
didn't give up being patient.
But now my patience
has given way, Vidur.
I...
I didn't expect this
from Yudhisthir!
Grandsire
you still can't lose
your patience.
You are the foundation
of Hastinapur's potential.
The loosening of a single brick
can never bring down a palace.
Even if this deed of Yudhisthir
is considered unrighteous
and a blasphemy...
Still, grandsire
give a thought to Yudhisthir's
other virtues.
Silence, Vidur!
Quell your words!
The loosening of a single brick
begins the downfall of a palace.
This blasphemy of Yudhisthir
can never become acceptable
to me.
Never.
Cast your eyes there.
Do you know
that the throne of the empire
and the flag
differ in what ways?
The throne stands for potential
and the flag stands for hope.
True words, Vidur.
This flag is the hope
of the empire.
It doesn't bow
to the wind.
A king should be as such, Vidur
who, upon sighting a challenge,
livens up with energy.
Faces that challenge
rather than cowering
in its fear
and accepting unrighteousness
and blasphemy.
When this flag
stops fluttering in the wind,
it means
that the flag is torn.
When a king...
Accepts unrighteousness
and blasphemy
it should be considered
that his potential
has been ruined.
Today
Yudhisthir's potential
as a king has been ruined.
Now this throne
is out of bounds
of Yudhisthir's rights.
If grandsire addresses
our deed as blasphemy
and ousts us
and enthrones Duryodhan
as the king
we have to follow
his order.
In the court, grandsire
stole his eyes away from us.
We hadn't forsaken
Hastinapur then, brother.
Right after we left the court
we should've
forsaken Hastinapur.
Why did we even return
to our palace?
This is our home, Bheem.
Home is defined by the
existence of rights, brother.
Brother Bheem is saying
just the same.
The very way in which this is
our home and we have come here
likewise, you alone have the
right to the throne, brother.
You'd have to acquire the same
only by seeking.
Our hearts aren't
malicious either, brother.
The deed which appeared
a blasphemy to grandsire
was perfectly normal
as per Sage Vyas.
In so being, another question
of import is raised, brother.
If we follow any such order
of grandsire
then it would be proved
before the world
that we have sinned
and so has Draupadi.
If we follow any such order
of grandsire
then it would be proved
before the world
that we have sinned
and so has Draupadi.
We can't allow Draupadi's
character to be slurred thus.
Thus, we have to be firm
in our defence.
But disobeying grandsire's order
is also a sin.
That's the quandary I am in.
Draupadi
what do you opine?
The quandary that you state
has still got me perplexed,
lord.
Is it a danger arising
out of righteousness
or a danger to righteousness?
It would be both now.
Rights are righteous.
It's causing the danger.
Orders are also righteous.
They are in danger.
If you permit
I would like to speak
with grandsire.
Why?
Rights are decreed by
your sense of righteousness.
The danger arising out of that
will have to be averted by you.
In the court tomorrow.
But the danger looming
on our righteousness
is due to me.
I will find a solution to that.
I have always looked
forward to news about you.
But having never seen your face
left me restless.
Father, I've been waiting
for you since birth.
Now, I will always stay with you
and serve you with all my heart.
Surely, my dear.
I am here to take you home.
How did you acquire
such terrific archery skills?
My mother always says that
a peacock is bound to lay
eggs that are either
white or yellow in colour.
But a peacock still bears
multi-coloured feathers.
I am your son.
I was born with your skills.
My uncle reminds me all the
time that I should learn to kill
because killing my father's
enemies is my path to salvation.
My mother reminds me all the
time that I should learn to die.
Dying while avenging my aunt's
libel is my path to salvation.
I knew that your uncle
was a man of intellect.
And that your mother
is such a fool!
Why would you die, my son?
You were born to be immortal.
Where is your mother?
And where is your uncle?
Mother is in her chamber
while uncle is at
the edifice of combat arts.
Uncle Duryodhana
is paying him a visit.
What work
brings Prince Duryodhana here?
Forgive me, master.
Forgive me.
My mind roves.
I see enemies
wherever I look.
Master, all I ever see
are enemies.
There is no joy left
in my life.
Put an end to my misery, master.
Kill me!
Prince Duryodhana.
Whimpering doesn't befit you.
Master
I will be honest
with you.
What frightens me more
than the dark of the night
is the darker period of eclipse.
My honour, my dreams
and my life
have been eclipsed, master.
I feel more pain
than death can cause.
Just like rotten luck itself
the Pandavas
have devoured
all my happiness, master.
Every last bit of it.
What have the Pandavas done?
They have been sentenced
to an exile
while you have spent your life
in the comfort of a palace.
You talk of exile, master?
Am I at fault for their exile?
If they hadn't
participated in gambling
they wouldn't have lost.
But, master
I was born to face injustice.
Why am I not the rightful
heir to my father's empire?
Why?
Why can't my father hand
over his throne to me?
Why?
How can Aryavart* be so unjust to me?
*"Abode of the Vedic India Aryans", the name for North India in classical Sanskrit literature.
The Pandavas insisted
on my kingdom's division.
The woman I was supposed
to get married to...
They abducted her.
Try to recall, master
that I had to return from Dwarka
unwed to that woman.
The whole of Aryavart
mocked me, master.
Master.
I am not blaming you.
Instead I am bringing to light
how the Pandavas have meted
out insults to me all my life.
That's all I wish to disclose.
Now the Pandavas
are turning the entire
Aryavart against me.
So that they may wage
war against me.
How am I at fault?
How have I wronged them, master?
Duryodhana, you disrobed
a woman amidst a gathering.
Does that not qualify
as a wrongful act?
If a slave insults her master
amidst a gathering
punishing her for this act does
not qualify as a wrongful act.
Does it, Vasudev?
But in case
the punishment seems
excessively cruel
I apologise.
I am willing to expiate
for the same.
I will do that, master
but please put an end
to this injustice.
Master.
If a war does take place
it calls for a quid pro quo
action from my end as well.
The Kuru dynasty's entire
wealth will be obliterated.
Master.
Only you
can prevent this war
from taking place.
I? What can I do in this matter,
Prince Duryodhana?
Your support is what
fuels the Pandavas, master.
If you withdraw your support
the Pandavas cannot even
contemplate going to war.
They cannot.
What is it that you
really wish, Duryodhana?
What do want us to do?
Vasudev.
Vasudev, we aren't worthy
of advising yourself
and the all-conquering Balram.
We can only request
that both of you
refrain from
taking sides.
You should not worry
about that, Shakuni.
Such a thing
will never transpire.
Prince Duryodhana
is absolutely right.
The outcome of a game
of gambling cannot act
as a reason for war.
Therefore, I promise you today
that I
Krishna or any other
soldier of the Yadav army
will not pick up a weapon
in support of the Pandavas.
You... Your words are bliss,
all conquering Balram.
that I,
Krishna or any other
soldier of the Yadav army
will not pick up a weapon
in support of the Pandavas.
Elder brother.
What kind of a decision is that?
How can you consider us at fault
without even listening
to our side of the story?
Prince Arjun.
I'm not finding fault
with anyone here.
I am only trying to understand
what the situation demands.
From what I can understand
two groups decided to engage
in a game of gambling.
Both sides agreed to all
the rules of the game.
And your group ended
up on the losing side.
Upon being defeated
you cannot start a great war
as a means of having revenge.
We were cheated,
brother Balaram.
Then you should have
quit the game.
But we were bound
by our promise.
Only when you know
the entire situation
will everything be clear to you.
Prince Arjun!
No truth about this situation
is hidden from me.
Despite your absence,
people have talked about
that game of dice
all these years.
That is why,
I need no information
from either you or anyone else,
Prince Arjun.
Maybe you feel that I have been
influenced by the weeping
of Crown Prince Duryodhan
but it is not so.
Since the beginning, I have
believed in only one truth
and it is
that in the game of dice
Crown Prince Duryodhan
did not act as unrighteously
as Prince Yudhishthir.
He had bet his wife in the game.
He had bet his brothers
in the game!
That is the most
unrighteous act.
Despite all this,
Prince Yudhishthir
did not quit the game.
He had the opportunity to do so.
When he was asked if he
was proud of his decision
to bet his brothers
he could have quit the game
but Prince Yudhishthir
did not do so
because his righteous ways
had made him arrogant.
When one's righteous ways
make a person arrogant
Prince Arjun
one acts solely
in an unrighteous manner.
In an unrighteous manner.
That is why, the promise I made
to Crown Prince Duryodhan
seems correct to me.
Madhav
please persuade brother Balaram
to change his mind
and take our side.
How can I persuade him,
friend?
He is correct.
Arrogance
always makes one commit
the gravest of acts.
It is true
that now,
even I
am bound by
my brother's decision, friend.
On behalf
of the Pandavas
we cannot fight any longer.
He won!
- He has won!
He won!
- He has won!
He won!
- Charioteer, stop the chariot.
He won...
- He lost!
He lost!
- He has lost!
He lost!
- He has lost!
He lost!
- He has lost!
He lost!
- He has lost!
He lost!
- He has lost!
He lost!
- Enough!
What is all this?!
Mighty Balaram!
Just look
at all this!
Stop them!
Bhamri, only I have
the sole right to you now!
No!
I will not leave
my husband and family
and go to someone else!
This is what we had decided!
If I knocked him over
then his wife
would belong to me!
Move away!
What is this foolishness?!
By betting a woman
you are tarnishing
the name of wrestling!
End this game
right away!
What loathsome
behaviour is this?!
If one does not bet
something in a game
then the game is no fun.
You cannot stop us,
Mighty Balaram.
Here, you are given the same
respect we give to the King
but you are not the King.
In Dwaraka,
the subjects are the King!
What on earth are you
rambling on about?!
Who are you to stop us?
We will do what we want.
This woman was bet in the game!
Now, she belongs
only to the winner.
First,
you insulted a woman
and now,
you are challenging me!
Do you know
its consequences, fool?!
If you have such strength
then go and ask
the Kauravas and the Pandavas
the same question.
Let him go,
brother.
We shall discuss this with the
subjects and Ministers later.
This is not
the appropriate time.
These maidens will be
safe with Queen Satyabhama
and Queen Rukmini.
If anyone tries to lay
even a finger on them
then I shall punish him myself.
There will be no war!
How is that possible?
What kind of a decision
has uncle taken?
When it is a question
of Mother Draupadi's honour
righteousness-unrighteousness
do not come into the picture!
I shall go and ask uncle
about this right away.
Abhimanyu!
Your father has
not taken this decision
and neither has brother Krishna.
My Lord
nothing that brother says
has one meaning.
Did you forget?
Did you forget that his other name is Ranchhod*?
*Ranchhodrai, one refused to fight the war and fled to Dwarka for the sake of peace.
Sometimes, in order
to defeat the enemy
brother exits
from the battlefield.
He need not take to arms
to emerge victorious.

Greetings, teacher!
- May you live long.
Arjun.
I am proud of you.
You are nonpareil.
The winner of today's
competition is undoubtedly you.
No other warrior has
the competence or adroitness
to defeat you.
Arjun is not only the most
superior among the Kuru Princes
but also no warrior in the world
can match up to him.
Subjects of Hastinapur!
My disciple
and your Prince Arjun
in reality, is truly
the best archer of the world.
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!
Arjun, release him
from this bond.
All hail...
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!
Karna...
Who are you?
With whose permission did you
dare to shoot an arrow like so?
When one makes a sound
between two mountains, sire
the sound is bound to echo!
A mountain waits
for no one's permission!
Sanjay.
What is happening here?
- Your Majesty
some archer has released
Prince Duryodhan from his bond.
Now, he is making
his way to the arena
maybe, to challenge Arjun.
Namely, we also have such
brave men among our subjects.
You are challenging Arjun, lad!
Do you not know
that this competition is
only between the Kuru Princes?
It was, sire.
And until this competition
was between the Kuru Princes
I was silent.
But upon seeing a few stunts by
Arjun, your excitement soared so
that you challenged
the entire world?
You declared Arjun
the world's best archer?
I too am a part
of the world, sire.
So, the dignity of millions
of archers of the world
and preserving it
is resting upon my shoulders.
That is why, you must either say
that Arjun is the best
only among the Kuru Princes
or order him
to accept my challenge and
add further glory
to your teachings.
Do you even have
a weapon in your hands
or just in your tongue?
Kripacharya,
this is a major crisis.
In the presence of
so many distinguished guests
the dynasty of Kuru
has been insulted.
To say that Arjun will win
might be an overstatement
but how can a Kuru Prince
accept a common man's challenge?
And if he loses
the Kuru kingdom will be forever
labelled a weak one, Vidur.
What are you pondering, sire?
Do you not have faith
in your disciple or
in your teaching?
What are you pondering, sire?
Do you not have faith
in your disciple or
in your teaching?
I am Karna.
I seek to learn the art
of archery from you.
My father is the charioteer
of the great Bhishma.
I shall return
but let me assure you
that I shall return as the
most skilled archer of India.
And I will be superior
to all your disciples.
I know you.
Are you not the one
who had come to become
my disciple? - No, sire.
The one you had seen that day
had died the very instant
you had refused to accept him
as your disciple.
You were fortunate, lad!
You were fortunate.
Otherwise you would have
lost your right hand's thumb.
People choose different paths
in order to become great!
Some choose effort
and some choose deception.
Similarly, a warrior
engages in battle
while a murderer poisons people.
Is this not what you wish
to say uncle?
That is exactly
what I wish to say, Arjun.
That is what I wish to say.
To decline the challenge
is an insult to your teacher.
Accept it.
- I had accepted it the moment
it had been made to me.
Now, I only await
the competition to begin.
Stop, Prince!
Before the competition begins,
it is crucial to know
as to who the challenger is.
According to the norms
of religion and traditions
a king can fight only with
another king or a prince.
And a prince
can fight only with another
prince or a chief minister.
And a chief minister
can fight only with another
chief minister or a general.
In other words, a warrior
can challenge someone
equal to his rank
or a person who is of
a higher rank than him.
Who are you, lad?
You did not introduce yourself.
Before challenging anyone
to a fight
introduce yourself, lad.
Who are you?
You do not seem like a prince.
To which clan of Kshatriya
do you belong?
Do not ask him
that question, Kripacharya.
A warrior who bears such courage
does not deserve to be insulted.
Insult?
Telling about
my lineage and clan
is not insulting to me, sire.
I am
the great Bhishma's charioteer,
Adhirath Sushain's son.
Shudra!
So, you are the son
of a charioteer!
Despite being the son
of a charioteer
how did you even dare
to learn the art of weaponry?
Yes, I am a charioteer's son!
And I am proud of my father
who provided service to Bhishma
with complete devotion.
I am proud of my mother
who has fortified every inch
of me with her love.
Even today, because
of my mother Radha
when people call me Radheya
my heart becomes ecstatic.
I condemn every person
who is ashamed to be associated
with his parents' identity
and finds it an insult!
The son of a charioteer
cannot compete with a prince.
Why can he not?
How is my capability
related to my caste?
No one questions a waterfall
that cleaves through mountains
as to where its source is!
Its strength is its identity!
No one asks the lotus
that is offered to Lord Shiva
as to where it originated!
Its beauty is its clan!
Then why do you ask me?
Why?
No one asks the lotus
that is offered to Lord Shiva
as to where it originated.
Its beauty is its clan.
Then why do you ask me?
Why?
Pardon him, Kripacharya.
Let us go, son.
No, father.
Today, I must prove
my capabilities in this arena.
I am undoubtedly a better
archer than Prince Arjun.
Be quiet, Radhe!
And let us leave!
It is your father's order
that you will not
compete in this!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Listen to your father
because he knows that your kind
has no capabilities!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Did I not tell you?
To make a place here
and to garner respect
are two things destiny
will never bless us with.
Let us go, Karna.
Karna!
Let us go from here!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!
Son.
L-Let us go from here.
Let us go.
Stop, archer!
I wish to ask royal teacher
Kripacharya a question.
When Ravan, a Brahmin,
put forth a challenge
then why did Lord Ram,
a Kshatriya, accept it?
When challenged by a descendant
of the demon clan
why did our ancestor Dushyant
decide to fight him?
Because they both were kings.
It is tradition that...
- That
if this archer were to be
the king of a region
then he can challenge Arjun.
Then from this moment
this archer is a king.
I declare him king!
I banish you and your family
from the kingdom this instant!
Leave Hastinapur
at the earliest!
You are banishing us...
Uncle
what crime are you
punishing us for?
Crime?!
You have come to this court
after committing a grave sin
Yudhishthir
and yet you ask me
what your crime is?!
The soul of my beloved
younger brother Pandu
must be crying bitterly
in the heavens today!
My ancestors must be hurt
and ashamed because of you!
Our deed is no sin, uncle.
The chaste daughter
of the Great Sage Kandu
Marisha, had married
ten Prachetas.
Marisha had given birth
to Prajapati Daksh, uncle.
And that is what led to
the genesis of the creation.
Had marrying more than
one man been a sin
the entire human race
would have been deemed
the fruit of that sin, uncle.
Sins and merits do not
depend upon a deed.
The intention behind the deed...
Was it righteous or devious...
Sins and merits depend upon
the intention behind the deed.
But the ones who see deviousness
as the source of merits...
How can such people have the
intelligence to understand sins?
Brother Duryodhan
an elephant
putting dirt on its head
should not be deemed
a devious behaviour.
In order to rid itself
of parasites
it engages in such
an unusual behaviour.
Man also comes across situations
where resorting
to atypical solutions
is the only way out.
Grandsire Bhishma
has also accepted
that our deed
is a righteous one.
Grandsire
I request you
to say something.
Your Highness
the situation that arose
in Kampilya...
I gathered information about it.
Then I discussed it with Vidur.
After scrutinizing it
from every possible angle
and in order to solve
this peculiar problem
by also looking into
other possible alternatives
they took this decision.
This decision of theirs
has the support of
the Great Sage Vyas.
This is an unrighteous deed
Yet
the sons of Pandu
and the Princess of Panchal
are guiltless.
We must accept their marriage.
Under no circumstance
will I accept it,
great Bhishma!
The words of a person
and the decision of a King
are two different things, uncle!
Irrespective of what an esteemed
person of a society says
rules are made by
the ruler of a kingdom
only after considering
all the strata of the society
including the most destitute,
ignorant and inferior, uncle!
And I am the King of Hastinapur.
I, Dhritarashtra, am the King
of the Kuru dynasty.
Any deed that encourages
wrong doers in the future
cannot be accepted by me, uncle.
I do not accept it
under any circumstance!
Your Highness
we five brothers and our wife
are ready to walk through a pyre
before the entire society
to prove our innocence!
Even the wrong doers
of the society will know
that after committing a deed
that seems unrighteous
they too will have to
walk through a pyre.
And Your Highness
poisoning a child and then
throwing him in the river
before letting a warrior
reach the arena
attempting to kill him
under a debris of rocks
and conspiring to kill family
by burning them in a palace
made of lac and clarified butter
are also deeds
which can encourage wrong doers.
If one continues committing
such deeds, Your Highness
then the throne of Hastinapur
will be left with no heir!
Your Highness!
Your Highness
I had pleaded to you
last night itself
to give my nephews,
my darlings
the permission to go to Gandhar
with me and settle there.
Your Highness,
your nephews and mine
cannot reside
in the same kingdom.
First, they commit such a
grave unrighteous deed
and to top it all,
they are accusing people!
Shame on them!
Uncle is correct, father.
What else can these people do?
A woman who has
relationships with five men
can neither know
what righteousness is
nor can she teach it
to her husbands.
Brother Duryodhan!
The one who insulted Panchali
shall be beheaded by me!
- Arjun!
Pardon me, Your Highness
but a person who does nothing
to defend his wife's honour
can only be a corpse!
He cannot be alive.
- Be quiet!
For taking to arms
in the royal court
I sentence you to death, Arjun!
You cannot sentence him
to death, Your Highness.
Your daughter-in-law
the future of this dynasty
the fortune of this lineage
was insulted by a person
but you did not sentence him
to death, Your Highness!
That is why, someone
who defends his wife's honour
cannot be sentenced to death
by you, Your Highness!
You can only
challenge him to a battle!
And I accept the challenge
to a battle!
To defend Draupadi's honour,
five formidable forces
the five Pandavas will rise
to the occasion, Duryodhan!
You will be annihilated!
Annihilated!
Stop!
Insulting the dynasty's
daughter-in-law
being unjust to the Crown Prince
creating an environment
of a battlefield in the court...
For how long will this
sacred court of Hastinapur
keep getting tainted
by your sons, Your Highness?!
My sons...
I cannot stay in this court
even a moment longer!
Your Highness
when a building
is feared to collapse
intelligent people
construct supportive structures
in it as a preventive measure.
I fear, Your Highness
that in order to protect
the Kuru dynasty
it is time now
to divide the kingdom.
Human!
There's human
in my land.
But I am not scared.
I have Lord Indra's blessings
with me.
On this land of mine
no human
can establish
his kingdom.
It's time to destroy them all.
Hail Nageshwar!*
*Shiva's first jyotirlinga/temple (the radiant sign of the almighty).
Is this the reward for
being kind?
If we had opposed
the partition
then they would be compelled
to coronate brother Yudhisthira
as the king of Hastinapur.
After a war, Nakul.
War is not a better choice
than partition.
Are you scared of battles,
brother Arjun?
A distinguished warrior is
always scared of war.
He doesn't fear
his death
but the loss
of other's lives.
If you're so concerned
for the lives of others
then make arrangements
for my meals.
I'm dying out of hunger.
Let me first pay my obeisance
to Mother Earth
then I'll arrange for
the meals.
Mother Earth
accept the prayer of the ones
who wish to dwell in your
propinquity.
Bless us so that we perform
the veneration
with all our heart
and our hard work.
And we don't want
anything beyond our necessities.
We will always respect
the other living beings
who dwell in your shelter.
Bless our subjects with
peace and prosperity.
Run! Run! Run!
It's Takshak and his army.
Run! Run!
Oh God!
Brother we'll have to make use
of our weapons.
We'll have to protect
everyone.
Draupadi, you be
with the subjects.
Bhima, you and I will
protect the subjects.
Nakul, Sahdev, stay with Arjun.
Come on!
Vrushali!
V-Vrushali.
V-Vrushali.
Vrushali!
Vrushali.
Come on, run!
Wait, Takshaka!
There's no need for
you to attack.
We're not here to fight
a battle with you.
We all are the children
of Mother Earth.
All of us can live
here peacefully.
Father...
Father!
Why?
Why did all this happen,
Your Highness?
So many innocent people died.
They have been punished
for having chosen
the path of religion.
Why have they been punished
for having faith
in your potential,
Your Highness?
What enmity does
Takshaka have with us?
Calm down, Draupadi.
How can I calm down,
Your Highness?
Vrushali had said
that it's always the subjects
who have to sacrifice
for the welfare
of their king.
But, I had told her, then
that no
that will not happen
here on.
But, look
she's been proven right.
How can a kingdom nurtured
by so many deceased bodies
bring us welfare?
Have patience, Draupadi.
They aren't dead yet.
If the poison of the snakes is
removed at the earliest
then they all can be saved.
So...
So then get rid of
the poison, Prince.
What are we waiting for?
They are miraculous snakes,
Draupadi.
Only those snakes
who have bitten them
can remove this poison.
We will have to find
those snakes
before they succumb to it.
Where will we
find those snakes?
That evil Takshaka and his army
disappeared long ago.
To go and find each one...
We don't have
that much time.
Don't call them evil, Bhima.
This land was theirs.
Those snakes tried
to survive with the humans.
But they were not
benefitted at all.
They had to lose their land
and move to the forests.
That is the reason behind
Takshaka's enmity with humans.
When the rights of
the children of Mother Earth
are snatched from them
that's when rebellions like
Takshaka take birth.
You mean, Takshaka who
murdered so many humans
is not a sinner?
No.
Takshaka is not a sinner.
He has just lost
his path.
He is increasing the discord
between humans and snakes
which is benefitting no one.
And the entire snake clan
that is following him
are victims
and not criminals.
If we have decided
to establish a kingdom here
then along with
the humans
welfare of the snakes
too is our responsibility.
And if we do that
then the entire
clan of snakes
will love
and respect us.
All the snakes are hiding
in that forest, brother.
But the forest too
is filled with illusions.
You're right, Sahdeva.
A demon by the name
of Maya lives there
who is friends
with Takshaka.
He has created that illusion.
In front of brother
Arjun's weapons
all illusions fail, brother.
For that, we have to
fight a battle, Nakul.
With Lord Indra Himself.
Lord Indra!
Lord Indra
come and fulfill
your promise.
You had promised
that on this land
other than snakes
no one else shall dwell.
Today...
Today
on this land of snakes
the humans have come
to claim their rights.
Lord Indra!
Please, appear.
Please, appear before me.
You forgot
your promise
Lord Indra.
I haven't forgotten,
Takshaka.
I have kept this land void
of water for such a long period
so that no one
other than you
can reside here.
But the humans who have
come here now
are divine.
The person who attacked
you with arrows
has taken birth because
of my blessings.
I consider him my son, Takshaka.
The essence of
five Gods
have given birth
to these five Pandavas.
Remember
no matter what
the circumstances be
you cannot defeat them.
But you can, Lord Indra.
Or is it
that after
seeing your son
you have become
blind in love.
Don't be foolish, Takshaka.
Realise the truth.
When water falls
at a certain place
it makes the place wet.
In the same manner
when there's competence
it finds a place
of its own.
I bind you
with your promise,
Lord.
Even if you have to
kill your own son
you can't break this promise.
You will have to
stop them.
Okay, Takshaka.
I cannot break my promise.
But remember
there are powers
in this world
that can defeat me.
I have been defeated
many a times.
King Nahusha
was a human.
He had defeated me.
If I am defeated
by the Pandavas
then you can be in
a much worse state.
You cannot be defeated, Lord.
I am
an illusive snake
and Mayasur has
made this forest
illusive too.
You just support us
by being the secret force.
We will shatter
all their dreams.
Yes
the snakes are blessed
with Lord Indra's protection.
And you're Lord Indra's Godson
an incarnation
and were born out of his traces.
You are his Godson.
Lord Indra is like
your father.
Will you be able to
fight a battle against him?
Who is that fool
who is blocking
the path this way?
Remove your cart!
What is the problem?!
Do you not have the strength
to remove the cart?
Eating a lot has given you
only a big exterior
but no intelligence.
You 5 brothers will touch
the feet of us 100 brothers.
Right now!
And forever after.
You need not worry
one bit for Hastinapur.
Very soon, the reason
of your worry
will come to an end,
brother Bheem.
Poisoning all of us first
and then torching this place
were all part of a scheme!
This way, everyone will think
that we died in an accident.
Duryodhan has schemed
to burn you, our mother!
Charioteer, remove that fool
and his cart from the path.
Crown Prince, the wheel
of the cart is probably stuck.
All of you are frail and infirm!
You cannot even remove a cart!
For such a base task
I will have to get down
from the chariot now!
Friend Duryodhan...
Stop, friend.
I shall go help him, friend.
The Crown Prince of Hastinapur
to push a cart in
the city of Kampilya
does not seem correct.
Stop, friend.
Revered 'Brahmin
it is important for us
to reach the palace promptly.
Let me help you lift the cart.
Allow me, revered 'Brahmin.
Stop!
You resemble...
You seem familiar.
Who are you?
What is your name?!
I...
- Brother Someshwar!*
*It means "Lord Krishna".
Brother Someshwar.
Friend, you should go back.
I shall remove this right away.
Allow me, revered 'Brahmins.
Accept our heartfelt gratitude.
Be it a cart or life
when the wheel
gets stuck in the earth
it cannot be lifted
without the aid of someone.
Be it life or a cart
when the weight
exceeds the limits
only then does the wheel
get stuck in the earth.
Brahmins
here you go.
Here is some money as charity
from Hastinapur.
Pardon me, Prince.
We earn with labour
and renounce with love.
Neither do we accept charity
nor engage in it.
Charioteer, proceed!
Had you not come today
he would have certainly
died at my hands.
But brother Bheem
we have pardoned him.
- No!
I did not pardon him.
I have merely decided
not to punish him.
Then what is the point
in pardoning him, brother Bheem?
When the enemy
is right before you
forgetting the wounds
given by him
is not that easy.
Even when a mongoose
has been raised on milk
it will still attack a serpent
upon seeing it
because they are arch enemies.
You are correct, brother Bheem.
Let's go now.
But why has he come here?
To take part in the 'swayamvar
of Princess Draupadi.
Will King Drupad have his
daughter married to him?
It is a 'swayamvar.
A woman decides
her husband in this.
Who knows
who resides in her heart.
Handmaiden...
Handmaiden.
Where is that painting?
- What painting, Princess?
The one that Malini had brought.
The painting of Prince Arjun.
Go and bring it at once.
Draupadi
why do you require
that painting?
When Prince Arjun will arrive
at the 'swayamvar' tomorrow
you will certainly know.
I too wish to determine, sister
whether I will be able to
recognize Prince Arjun or not.
The truth is,
I wish to determine
whether the person I came across
was Prince Arjun
or not.
What do you mean?
Upon going to
the Shiva temple today
I had a strange encounter,
sister.
Upon seeing a 'Brahmin
I felt as though
Lord Shiva was giving me
a sign.
The Almighty can never
give such a sign, Draupadi.
As to who you are to be married
will be decided at
the 'swayamvar' tomorrow.
And even if the Almighty
had given such a sign
He would have alluded
to some King or Prince
and not a 'Brahmin,' Draupadi.
Is the Almighty also bound
by the plans of man, sister?
No
but a Princess is bound
by her oath, Draupadi.
Whoever wins
the 'swayamvar' tomorrow
shall be married to you.
This is your oath.
What if
in the guise of a 'Brahmin
it was Prince Arjun himself?
What if
upon seeing that painting,
I get the same sign
I had got in the Shiva temple?
Princess
where do we place this painting?
So, Draupadi...
Did you get any sign?
No.
I did not get any sign.
No one can recognize us
in this disguise, mother.
But had brother Bheem's
anger exceeded its limit today
the whole of Kampilya
would have found out.
This disguise can
camouflage our look
but not our temperament
and disposition.
If our cover is blown,
we will be in deep water, Bheem.
Grandsire will certainly
look for us
and take us back to Hastinapur.
The situation
we have been dreading
will come into being
right before our eyes.
We must leave Kampilya
soon, son.
Many Kings will be present
at the'swayamvar.
Nakul and Sahadev's uncle
the King of Madra,
will recognize them.
And if Krishna and Balaram
are also present there
then they will certainly
recognize Arjun.
But mother
I have heard
people of the city say
that the King of Panchal is
hosting a difficult competition.
A competition that can be won
only by the best archer
of the world.
In other words
by brother Arjun.
The King of Panchal
must certainly
be awaiting brother Arjun,
mother.
The Arjun who had captured
the King of Panchal
was burnt to ashes
in Varnavrat, Nakul.
No one is awaiting this Arjun.
As you are going
to the Shiva temple now
you should ask
Lord Shiva himself.
He is the Lord of Death
and Salvation.
That is why, He always
gives a definite answer.
If you are to get your answer
then you shall get it
only from Him.
And even if the Almighty
had given such a sign
He would have alluded
to some King or Prince
and not a 'Brahmin.
Prince Arjun.
O storyteller
tell us something more about
Dwarka's regent, Krishna.
So be it, Prince Uttar.
Along with brother Balram
the frolics of Lord Krishna, in Vrindavan.*
*A town 10 km from Mathura, an ancient forest, where Krishna spent his childhood days.
The son of Yashoda,
had mesmerised the world.
Capers of the naughty
and cute Lord Krishna.
He stole butter, played pranks
and annoyed men and women alike.
Make haste! Why are you looking
back, Koumudi?
I am afraid, the boys of Nand
might be hidden here.
That day, when I went to deliver
butter to the palace of Pathua
those wicked boys
broke my pitcher.
Yashoda's son loves butter,
Shubhangi.
But little do those boys know
that if this butter doesn't
reach King Kans' palace
his soldiers would punish us.
They are unaware of
King Kans' fury.
Don't worry. Yashoda kept
Krishna hungry, all day.
Moreover, she punished him
by tying him to a tree.
He will not dare to break
your pitcher, now.
She doesn't know what
all can Krishna do.
Balram, had Krishna been here
he would've given them
a befitting reply.
But where is he?
Let's search for him.
- Where?
Come on, let's search for him.
Krishna!
- Krishna... - Krishna!
Krishna...
- Krishna! - Krishna...
Krishna...
Krishna...
Krishna...
Krishna...
Krishna...
There you go, again he is
playing the flute!
Why does he play a flute while
herding cows?
Aren't we here to listen
to this music?
Oh, yes... Krishna!
Krishna, those maidens are
taking butter to Mathura.
Butter!
Krishna, we'll be punished
severely, if we get caught.
Two days back, my father
spanked me so badly
that even now, I can't sit.
Eat some butter and apply
some on your wounds.
Everything will be fine.
Do mix turmeric* in it.
*A perennial plant of the ginger family.
Come on, Krishna.
Take out your catapult.
Look at that!
One by one, Krishna broke
all their pitchers
and is stealing butter and milk,
as always.
He'll be punished.
Last time, he stole clothes.
- Come on.
Wicked! Wait...
Run!
Yashoda!
Yashoda!
Yashoda, look what your
Krishna has done.
He ate away three day's butter!
If you can't control that monkey
of yours
you should tie him up, at home.
- Your kids may be monkeys!
My Krishna's beauty
is captivating.
Then keep admiring him, all day.
Why is he making our lives
miserable?
Better if you punish him,
else we'll have to do something.
Let me see.
But if he hasn't eaten
the butter, remember
I'll give you a punishment that
you'll remember all your life.
Come on.
- Yes, surely.
Smacking the butter on his lips,
Krishna was relishing it!
People of Mathura were satiated
when he burped!
Krishna, you are again
being mischievous!
Because of you, these women
reprimand me.
Don't you care for your mother?
Tell me, you wicked.
Mother, it hurts.
It hurts me too.
When they complain to me.
Did you steal butter again?
- No, mother. I didn't steal it.
Liar! Look at the traces
of butter on his lips.
This butter?
Actually, when I got the butter
after breaking your pitcher
he told me to eat some!
I said, 'I don't eat
stolen butter'.
All of you can have it'.
Then Madhumangal, forcibly,
fed me this butter.
Saw that? My son disregards
stolen items.
Now, go away!
Hey, but he broke the pitcher!
- But I didn't eat the butter!
But your mother had
to face all this.
Come on, time for some
punishment from your father.
Come on. come on...
Mother! I didn't eat the butter!
- I know, come on.
Come on!
Come...
Come.
We have to give half
of the harvest to Kans.
In the entire empire
farmers give one-fourth of the
harvest, as tax.
But, Kans...
Kans demands half the share!
He keeps half of it and gives
the other half to Magadha.
In turn, Magadha offers him
protection.
Magadha's greed and
Kans' hunger for power
will annihilate all the Yadavs,
Respected Nand.
We'll not bear this injustice
for long.
Kans will be killed, soon.
- Who will kill him?
Somebody will surely come.
Surely...
Have faith.
Dear!
Kans will be killed.
But before that he will
kill all of us.
What makes you say that,
Yashoda?
Why will he kill us?
When all these maidens
go to give milk, butter and ghee,* as tax
*A class of clarified butter.
Krishna and his friends
break their pitchers.
They also sneak into their
houses and eat all the butter.
Krishna! Come here.
There you go, ask your son.
Now, what will they do?
Where will they get
so much butter from?
How will they pay
their tax to Kans?
Don't you know
what Kansa can do?
But you do know
what us children can do, mother.
You can do anything.
The cereals meant for the
people of the kingdom
is fed to the cows by you.
And you feed the fruits
to the monkeys.
Why do you want
to make Kansa our foe?
Father
it's our land, our effort,
our cattle
and products obtained
from their milk.
They are the cereals, fruits
and flower that we grow.
Why should Kansa relish them?
That's not ethical.
You are right, my son.
But we are helpless.
Kansa possesses the strength
of Jarasandh from Magadh.
A cattle gives up on food
when unwell
which makes
its condition worse.
So, rather than
being helpless here
it would be better
if we relocate
to a different place
for some time.
We can move to Vrindavan.
My friend Vrishbhan
can shelter us there.
But to move to Vrindavan,
we'll have to cross river Yamuna.
How are we going to do that?
The river is
the abode of serpent Kaliya
and he has established
its right over the Yamuna river.
He doesn't allow anyone
to cross the river.
He is the son of Kali.
How are we going to defeat
this seven headed serpent?
On one hand there's Kansa,
and on the other, serpent Kaliya.
How are we going
to get any relief?
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Krishna, don't be audacious.
Serpent Kaliya has spared
no one alive.
But we can't be as evil
as the serpent Kaliya.
I will surely spare him alive.
Don't you worry, Madhumangal.
Krishna!
Krishna...
Krishna...
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Krishna...
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
Foolish boy...
Who are you?
How dare you come
to this river
which is the abode
of serpent Kaliya!
Everyone has a right on
the water of this river, Kaliya.
You have turned
this water body poisonous.
Leave this river
as soon as possible
else, you will be punished.
Foolish boy!
Look at my size
and that of yours.
How are you going to
punish me?
Leave this place.
I warn you for the last time.
Krishna...
- Krishna!
Krishna!
- Krishna!
My King, please do something.
Forgive me, Krishna.
Don't kill me.
I will follow your order
but I am safe in the waters
of Yamuna.
Your forehead
now bears my footmarks.
That will keep you safe,
wherever you are
as long as you don't
harm a living being.
My King, please do something.
Save my son.
Krishna!
Krishna...
- Krishna! - Krishna!
Krishna!
You displayed such courage,
Vasudev!
Were you aware that you
are going to defeat Kaliya?
Of course I was aware of it.
God has blessed me
with special powers.
Hence, he was meant
to be defeated by me.
What kind of special powers?
God has blessed me
with a great power.
Do you what to know,
what it is?
The power to put my effort.
I am definite
that if with my effort,
courage and devotion
nothing is impossible.
But, uncle, all of us
make an effort.
You are right, Satsom.
Everyone puts an effort
and that's
the only thing necessary
to emerge victorious.
The fact is,
there's no special power
that God has only
blessed me with.
God never differentiates
between his children.
Everyone is born with
powers that are necessary.
But reasons such as
fear, attachment and greed
stop a person from trying.
And one who doesn't try
can never be successful,
my dear.
There is just one punishment
for this mistake.
Banish him
from the Kuru kingdom!
But Arjun is my beloved
brother Pandu's son.
Hence, I won't be able
to punish him.
Minister!
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Now, you shall decide
on a punishment.
Why are you quiet, uncle?
It is the King's order.
Decide on a punishment.
Prince Arjun has made
a mistake, Duryodhan.
But I am certain that
his intentions were not wrong.
No one can predict
one's intentions, Minister.
But judgment should be based
on what is evidently seen.
I believe
that if His Highness Karna
forgives Prince Arjun
then he needn't be punished.
Friend Karna shall
definitely forgive him.
But Arjun must
first wash his feet
and ask for forgiveness.
Minister
order Arjun to do so.
Prince Arjun
you must wash the feet
of His Highness Karna
and ask him for forgiveness.
Only if King of Anga,
Karna, agrees to it.
I agree to it.
Pardon me, King of Anga.
Let's proceed, Sanjay!
The occasion of the banquet
has been destroyed.
But, Your Majesty...
I won't be a part
of this banquet, Minister!
But yes...
This banquet was organized
to announce something.
Let me make that announcement.
Tomorrow
in the morning
at the court,
the Prince of Hastinapur
will be crowned by me!
I am certain that
tomorrow, Duryodhan
will be crowned as the Prince.
Brother Arjun was insulted
for the same reason.
When he couldn't defeat him
with his intellect
he took to insult
so that we are unable to reason
at the court tomorrow.
What will we
reason about, Nakul?
That you are the right person
to be crowned the Prince.
No.
Only Lord Indra gets to decide
as to how much rainfall
a place deserves.
Every mortal has to
abide by that decision.
A King too possesses
a similar right.
But if one is declared a ruler
then it certainly does not mean
that he can own
that kingdom forever.
Lord Indra is immortal.
He is not a common man.
No one gets to rule
a kingdom forever.
That is why, it is tradition
that whoever is bestowed
with the throne
gets to be the rightful King.
What if one conquers that
very kingdom with his might?
Isn't he the rightful King then?
We will attain our rights
with our might, brother!
We shall battle it out,
if the need be!
Brother, we cannot forget
how Arjun was insulted.
With whom will you fight, Bheem?
With your own family?
With grandfather Bhishma?
With uncle Dhritarashtra?
With uncle Vidur
or with your cousins?
No, Bheem.
You must not
even think of a war.
We have to abide
by what the King says.
Enough, Princess.
Thinking of unhappy things
only magnifies sadness.
Do not cry anymore.
Today, one of my sons
was insulted
by another son of mine.
When a brother insults
another brother
the bitterness remains
for life, Priyamvada.
But they don't know how they
are related in the first place.
Princess, they consider
themselves as enemies.
And enemies insult each other.
When the time comes,
even Prince Arjun will have
his revenge for being insulted
and will be contented.
What kind of a consolation
is this, Priyamvada?
How can I...
How can I
see them as enemies?
Arjun's heart must be
writhing in agony.
He might find a way
to fight with Karna.
Before that, I must pacify him.
Mother.
Arjun.
What are you doing, son?
The fire bath, mother.
Your tears of sadness
make me do the fire bath.
By doing so, I am repenting.
Mother, you are crying
because of me.
No, son.
You are not at fault.
It is my fault, mother.
You have taught me
that the other name
for strength is patience.
A person who loses his patience
also loses his strength.
That is why...
That is why, I lost my patience.
And this is my mistake, mother.
This is my mistake.
And this is the reason...
This is the reason why
you have tears in your eyes.
When a mother cries
because of her son
a strange agony pervades
her emotions and even her laugh
gets tainted by it, mother.
Look.
I am smiling now.
Now, quit feeling sad.
Stop!
Enemies are not premitted
to go near his Excellency!
Go and tell grandsire
that his grandsons
wish to meet him.
We have no weapons on us.
Go
and seek his permision.
His Excellency,
the sons of Pandu are here.
They have no weapons on them
and they seek your permission to meet you.
No,
they do not have my permission.
If they meet me today
then tomorrow in the battlefield
they will not be able to strike at me.
Go and tell the sons of Pandu
that His Excellency Bhishma
cannot meet the enemies.
Stop!
Go and tell them
that they do have my
permission to meet me.
Grandsire,
all of us...
Before you say anything,
you must listen to me.
As long as I am alive
I have no intention of
forsaking my duties.
In other words
neither will I
give up my weapons
nor give up protecting
the sons of Dhristarashtra
It is the duty of all of you
that you must
battle with all your might.
If you need
to make a sacrifice
then you must do so gladly
and obtain victory.
In other words
slaying me is your duty.
If...
If any of you
forsakes this duty
then
it will break my heart.
My death
will become excruciatingly agonizing.
Even after listening to all this
if you still have a question
then go ahead and ask.
- But, grandsire...
- I know, dear.
The very thought of my death
makes your heart shudder.
However
it is a moment of good fortune for me
because the journey of a very
long and unsuccessful life
is drawing to an end.
In my life
I have seen nothing but misery
and now
it is time for my miseries to end.
And
I can have
that good fortune from
all of you.
Until now
you have obeyed all my orders.
Today
you must obey one last order
of your grandsire.
While slaying me
even if your heart shudders
your hands must not tremble!
[MUSIC]
I have only one question
for you, grandsire.
You are illuminating to us
the path to have the kingdom.
But who will dispense sound advice to us
to govern it?
Grandsire.
It was your oath.
That until you help
the throne of Hastinapur
get a king who is both
righteous and competent
you will not leave this world.
With this oath as our basis.
Did we begin this war.
However, after our victory.
If you are not there,
then who will test us?
Who will test us, grandsire?
Grandsire.
Until a judge gives the permission.
No deed can truly be called just.
When the son of Dhritarashtra get slain 
by me over here.
Who will assure us
that this is not murder.
But justice?
If you leave, then this battlefield
will be robbed of rightnousness
forever, grandsire.
Forever...
All of you are correct.
A few of my duties have
not been fulfilled yet.
I give you my word.
That before I leave this world.
I shall discharge all my duties.
You must expunge yourselves
of all your suspicions.
And discharge your duties.
Now, this judge shall
award himself a punisment!
He allowed the wife of his grandsons,
and his daughter-in-law
to be humilliated before everyone.
Hence the son of Shantanu.
Devavrat Bhishma is awarded death!
Before sundown tomorrow,
this punishment shall be imposed!
Now, all of you...
All of you should leave.
[MUSIC]
May you live long!
May you be victorious!
Draupadi.
Dear, could you wait for a while?
You may remember this, dear.
You had said during the game of dice...
"Duryodhan will indeed be punished for his sins."
"But before that every person
present in this court"
"will be punished for his silence."
"This is the curse of Yajnaseni Draupadi!"
That curse of yours
is about to yield its results now.
I...
Accept this punishment
of yours, dear.
A culprit...
attains liberation
only after being pardoned.
Will you...
be able to pardon this culprit of yours, dear?
No, Grandsire.
Please do not plead with me.
Dear...
Determining man's age...
in terms of years
is not correct.
His age...
is determined by the number
of sacrifices he makes.
You...
For this dynasty of mine, you...
have made way more sacrifices than me.
You truly are worthy of reverence, dear.
Will you...
be able to pardon me and
grant me liberation, dear?
Your highness.
Is it true?
Will Shikandini, the daughter of Drupad
enter the battlefield tommorow as a man?
She will enter not only as a man but
also as uncle's doom, Vidur!
She will enter not only as uncle's doom...
But also as that of my sons!
N-No...
T-That cannot be.
My sons cannot die.
M-My sons cannot die, Vidur.
Vidur!
Do something, Vidur.
Send a message.
Do something but under any circumstance, 
we must stop uncle from entering the battlefield.
We must stop him, Vidur.
In his safety lies
t-that of my sons, Vidur.
Go and send a message at once to
the battlefield, Vidur.
Send a message, that is my order...
That uncle is barred from
entering the battlefield!
That's impossible, your highness.
It is too late to send a message now.
The sun is about to rise, Your highness.
In just a few moments,
the war will begin.
Your excellency
allow me to be of service to you
for one last time.
You are a guru
and a guru
ought not serve others, Guru Drona.
A guru is one who does not
get bound to any tie in life.
The day I coveted the kingdom
I ceased to be a guru.
I merely become
a teacher who educates people.
Your excellency
I am not worthy of reverence.
In this battlefield
you shall attain liberation.
Similarly
after a while
I shall attain liberation too.
That day
it is possible
for me to regain
the title of a guru.
Today,
I am only a teacher.
Only a teacher.
So allow me to be
of service to you today.
Your excellency.
This is an honor to me.
So, do not keep it from me.
Goodbye!
I shall meet you again
in heaven, guru Drona.
May you be victorious sister!
May the Almighty helps you
get the revenge today that
you have seeked
in all your births.
May your heart
finally attains peace.
Uttar!
Except your five husbands, the whole dynasty 
will be wiped out in this war.
Master, today in the battlefield, I will raise 
the flag of victory.
Uttar!
Uttara
your brother is the first martyr.
A new foundation of the nation 
is being build,
and the first flag raised on it,
will be Uttar's, son of 
King of Virat.
Until the end of time,
Pandu's dynasty will be indebted 
to Uttar, Uttara.
Prince Uttar's sacrifice
will not go in vain, 
King of Virat.
Our enemies will definitely have 
our vengeance for this.
Water...
Yudhistira should've been 
died today, Grandsire.
If only King of Virat's son didn't 
display courage!
- Don't worry, my dear.
Tomorrow, his excellency Bhisma would certainly 
captured Yudhistira with his own hands.
Today we've shown destruction to 
our enemies' soldiers.
Tomorrow in the battlefield, no soldiers 
will protect him.
They all will be in fear,
after seeing our might!
Fear?
Foolish Duryodhana!
A widow's wailing will not make even 
her youngest child frightful.
So why do they have to fear?
Moreover what courage had you displayed, except for 
killing a 15 years old youth?
Even it was not with your own hands, 
but by forcing me to do it!
King of Madra,
from common soldier to the general,
the value of one's courage is 
devoted to the king.
Both victory or defeat, the value is still 
devoted to the king.
When the opening dish is served, there's no difference between 'laddoo' and 'kheer' because both of them are sweet, King of Madra.
We have victory today,
and in this battle, the other name of 
winning is courage.
Uncle's right.
Today's victory
will add strength to face 
tomorrow's battle.
I want to know,
winning can lift spirit in war.
Until you experience defeat,
how can be any lift in potency?
Prince Uttar not just saved 
Brother Yudhistira's life.
But saved us from defeat as well. 
He has become a guardian.
From now on, he won't let defeat 
to fall on us.
Righteousness is destined to achieve victory!
Crown Prince Duryodhana,
don't forget,
that in a war without the King's presence,
all responsibilites are imposed 
on the crown prince.
And in this war,
the king's not present, but you are.
That's why, think like a king.
And,
other than thinking about victory, 
think about your ability.
What if
today's win
becomes loss tomorrow?
Sons of Pandu will certainly 
make a plan
which effect's will demolish 
everyone's morals here.
Today, grandsire had broken 
our battle formation.
But tomorrow, it won't happen again.
Tomorrow, before the sun sets, 
we will capture Duryodhana.
The first day of war,
from 7 'akshauhini' army,
one had been destroyed 
by King Yudhistira.
And Vasudev
there's one question in our soldiers' mind.
If this is a righteous war, then why did we 
experience defeat today?
A righteous was is also a war, 
General Dhristadyumna.
In war, one can't escape neither 
from winning nor losing.
General Dhristadyumna,
a soldier's duty is to strife 
with his weapon.
Winning or losing is in the Almighty's hand.
But Prince Arjuna after Prince Uttar's death, 
fear has gripped each soldier's heart.
How can our soldiers retaliate Grandsire Bhisma 
and Master Drona attacks?
It is right.
As long as his excellency Bhisma 
has a role in this war,
victory is impossible for us.
Defeating Master Drona becomes 
impossible as well.
If grandsire still takes part in this war,
he will destroy all our armies.
Tomorrow, I will challenge grandsire, 
one on one.
These five Brahmans are
none other than
the princes of Hastinapur
the sons of Emperor Pandu.
And he's Arjun.
The one you dreamt of getting
Draupadi married to.
They are the Pandavas?
Disguised as Brahmans?
Impossible!
That's impossible!
- Your Highness
I assure you
welcoming them is your duty.
This is how I welcome them.
If they really are the Pandavas
they should be punished
for sure, Vasudev!
I'm sure these princes
of Hastinapur
hadn't come to Panchal
to get married.
They had come with a plan
to humiliate Panchal.
My daughter put the garland
around Arjun's neck
in full faith.
And in exchange he gave
Draupadi a reason
to shed tears all her life.
I believed, Vasudev
that they understand the
meaning of righteousness
and this is what they did.
God has made them do this,
King Drupad.
It's doesn't matter whether or
not they are innocent.
Because of them my daughter's
life has become miserable.
Whether she marries all five
of them or remains unmarried
she will face humiliation
all her life.
Because of them, Vasudev.
All because of them!
Not because of them,
Your Highness.
Because of you.
What future had you wanted
for Draupadi when she was born?
Try to recollect, Your Highness.
I ask that my daughter suffer
all her life.
May she be bestowed with
all the impurities of the world
but still be considered pure.
Can you give me such
a daughter?
May that girl endure injustice
time and again.
The consequences of the
deeds of parents
has to be borne by
their children.
Now, Draupadi too will get
all the sorrow
you had asked for her.
As you sow so shall you reap
King Drupad.
But, it's reassuring
that Draupadi will overcome
all her sorrow
and find a place among the
great women of the Aryans.
In the future, Draupadi will
be worshipped, Your Highness.
Now you should welcome
your five sons-in-law.
Vasudev Krishna is here,
princess.
Draupadi...
Are you happy with your
decision, dear?
Calm down, Draupadi.
Govind, what have I done?
How could I make such
a decision?
How could I have even thought
of this abomination?
How can a woman marry
five men?
This is immoral, Govind.
Absolutely immoral.
Why did you take such
an immoral decision, Draupadi?
What else could I have done?
How could I have allowed
mother Kunti's four sons
to become ascetics?
The mere thought would have
broken her heart.
But for my happiness
she didn't shed even a tear.
How could I be selfish
and think only about myself?
And Prince Arjun...
I have seen the disappointment
on his face.
How could I have
any desires, then?
How could I have let the four
princes make such a sacrifice
for my happiness?
And the whole community has
expectations from their princes.
How could I have disappointed
the whole community?
That's why I was forced to
be unrighteous.
I couldn't find any other way.
After considering the happiness
of so many people
you arrived at this decision,
Draupadi.
How could it be immoral?
After considering the happiness
of so many people
you arrived at this decision,
Draupadi.
How could it be immoral?
When a tiny pebble enters
a shell in the ocean
the shell turns it
into a pearl.
You, too, have turned
this immorality
into righteousness.
I am proud of you, Draupadi.
Govind...
The gift you gave me.
The five stones.
The five pillars of
righteousness.
When I saw them
I felt as if
you were ordering me to
marry the five Pandavas.
Govind...
Do you really consider
this to be moral?
No...
Never.
I cannot call this righteous
and fill the hearts of all
the women in the world
with sorrow.
It is immoral.
And it will always be immoral.
But...
Your compassion has made
you do this.
And compassion is the basis
of righteousness.
I don't understand, Govind.
The gift of five stones
that I gave you
was advice about righteousness.
Righteousness cannot
be demanded.
But you gave the five pillars
of righteousness
a place in your heart.
Knowledge calms the intellect.
Patience calms the mind.
Love soothes the heart.
And devotion
calms physical needs
and soothes the body.
And justice...
Justice calms the soul.
The mind, intellect, the heart,
the body and the soul
when these five pillars of
righteousness
are calm and steady
a human being is full
of compassion.
That is called righteousness.
And on the basis of
this righteousness
you have made this decision,
Draupadi.
And thus for you
and only you
it isn't a sin.
How will I live
with five husbands, Govind?
How will I live
with five husbands, Govind?
How will I be able to be
fair to all of them?
How will I fulfill my duties?
And the society...
How will I bear the taunts
of society?
The kind of thoughts people
would have about me, Govind!
Those who are righteous
are worshipped by God Himself.
You were born from fire.
And fire is also known
as the purifier.
It purifies everyone.
It destroys bad elements.
I believe
all those who come close
to you will be purified.
Don't worry, dear.
Whenever you need
any kind of help in life
then I
your friend
Vasudev Krishna
will come to you.
I promise you.
You only have to carry
the five pillars of
righteousness.
The throne of Hastinapur
awaits you.
Mother, Vasuki told me
to crush the heads of my enemies
in a similar way on
the battlefield.
Nakul, I hope you
understand crushing.
Powder!
Which on being consumed
cleanses the stomach.
Brother Bheem...
How can you laugh in such
an alarming situation?
Doesn't your blood boil
with anger?
Anger?
I am so angry that my
palms may emit fire
that is why I was
laughing, brother.
The sinners aren't aware
that Bheem has become stronger than Hanuman* himself.
*A central character in the epic Ramayana. Vayu is the spiritual father of Hanuman.
I have taken an oath.
I would be the one
to kill the hundred brothers.
Quiet, Bheem.
It isn't appropriate for us to
talk about killing our brothers.
Have you forgotten
father's words?
Bravery lies in being merciful
and not in seeking vengeance.
Yudhistir, don't tell him
to be quiet today.
One can forgive his enemies
but not his family members.
Plants come to life from water.
That's why wood
doesn't submerge in water.
The day wood
submerges in water
it will be doomsday.
And when a family deceives
there arises a calamity
in the family.
There's no longer any place
for us in Hastinapur.
We will now got to your
grandfather's place
to Kuntibhoj.
Kunti, don't punish the
Kuru dynasty so severely.
The daughter-in-law who at
her husband's house
doesn't get happiness, comfort
and respect
not only the family
but the entire dynasty
is disgraced.
The ancestors in heaven
feel humiliated.
But, sire...
I have collected all
the information
from my spies.
The way when a part of
a body is wounded
the brain feels the pain.
I'm enduring the pain
of this incident.
I have decided to find a
solution to this dilemma.
Dear, I request you
please stay back.
Believe me, Kunti.
Don't you trust me, dear?
Yes, sire.
Your majesty, couldn't you hear
my footsteps today?
I...
Greetings, sire.
You shouldn't greet me
sitting on the throne!
Aren't you conscious
about that today?
Your majesty, what were you
listening to with such
concentration that you didn't
hear my footsteps today?
I...
- You were probably listening to
the thundering sound of the
anarchy previaling in Hastinapur
Or were you hearing the
cries of our august
ancestors in heaven,
your majesty!
Why are your words so harsh?
- Because I had become tough
and taken an oath to protect
this throne and its glory.
What is the problem
that makes you... - Problem?
Your majesty, the problem
is that you haven't
called the justice committee.
Justice?
For what?
My son is innocent.
If you were confident
that he is innocent
then that could be heard
in your voice, your majesty.
Duryodhana is just a kid.
When you had decided to
make him the crown prince
hadn't you realized then
that he is a kid.
King, you have to do justice!
Pardon me, sire.
What judgment shall I rule out?
The love for my son
weakens me.
I was born blind.
Distrust is my sole asset.
So apart from my son
I am unable to trust
anyone else.
Dear, several people in
this world are blind.
You are not the first.
But they lead their life
respectfully and independently.
The don't plead for mercy.
They have made trust
the basis of their life
and not discontent
like you have.
Please forgive my son.
Let me assure you
I take an oath that
when the time comes
whoever you think is eligible
I will declare him as
the crown prince.
I will not argue.
But please pardon my
son for now.
If an innocent child kicks, no
one considers it a humiliation.
I will be agonized to
punish him.
I will be heartbroken.
If you tell me,
I will touch Kunti's feet
and apologise to her.
But do not order me
to judge Duryodhana.
Do not order me
to judge my Duryodhan.
Do not order me
to judge my Duryodhan.
Alright.
I have one adequate verdict
for the both of you.
You have to distance
yourself from him.
That would mean
the way Pandu's son
don't have the protection
of their father
in the same way
you have to stop
protecting your sons.
At Guru Drona's academic
institution
all your sons would study
for twelve years.
And in the twelve years
you will not try to contact
your sons in anyway.
Dear, you will be the one to
take the decision
today itself.
Kripi! Ashwathama!
I have taken my first step
towards my dream.
The burden of my past that
I carry within
I will soon be relieved of it.
Ashwathama!
Ashwathama.
Son, till now you were
destined to be impoverished.
Now...
I will see to it that you
become the king of a state.
With the help of these princes.
That's surprising!
The soldiers from
Gandhar are here.
With so many things
What has father sent
from Gandhar?
These are my belongings.
Who has loaded them
on the chariots?
These are arrangements
made for your journey
King Shakuni.
Greetings, Sir Bheeshma.
King Shakuni!
Why are you mocking me?
I am not mocking you.
Your father
the king of Gandhar, king
Subala has decided that
he will renounce his throne
and become an ascetic.
Thus, I addressed
you as the king.
Is father embracing anchorite?
Who gave you this information?
No one did.
Actually, I was the one
to send him a message
that it's time for him
to be an ascetic.
Thus...
He will declare his son
which means you,
as the king.
And Gandhar cannot dare
to disobey my orders.
Thus, you have finally
become a king.
And
do you have any reason
for being
so kind to me, Sir Bheeshma?
King of Gandhar,
the reason is
that it's right for a king
to stay at his capital.
Your team of bodyguards
are ready
to take you to Gandhar.
Please proceed.
Let me seek king
Dhritarashtra's permission...
That isn't needed.
I have taken the
king's permission.
Let me seek Gandhari's
permission...
I have taken the queen's
permission
on your behalf.
Please come.
Are you
throwing me
out of Hastinapur, Sire?
That there's no opportunity
to expel you
and you don't lose respect
that's what I'm trying to do.
Proceed.
Proceed!
Proceed!
A father always prays for
the well being of his child.
He worries about
the future of his progeny.
Due to this
he always tries to decide
their future endeavours himself.
The path which the father
has tread himself...
The path whose pitfalls he
is familiar with...
He knows where lies shade and
sunshine of the path
That should be the path
his son should take too.
This is the desire
of every father.
Indeed, it is
a noble intention.
But
we always forget to reflect
upon three questions.
Which questions?
The first question.
Doesn't every path
change with time?
Doesn't time always bring forth
newer challenges?
So, how can experiences from
a time gone by
benefit the new generation?
The second question.
Is every child
an image of his parents?
Yes.
Morals are always taught to
the children by the parents.
But, inner capability.
Inner capability is something
that's God gifted.
So do you believe the path where
the father has found success
is the path where the son shall
find success and bliss too?
Third question.
Aren't the challenges and
strife of life beneficial?
Doesn't every new question
open a portal to a new answer?
So does the act of
depriving children from
new questions, strife
and challenges
qualify as benefiting them
or harming them?
Therefore, just as
it would be best
to develop a child's character
rather than develop his future
similarly, instead of deciding
the path in a child's life
wouldn't empowering them
to face new conflicts
with confidence and knowledge
be more beneficial?
Think about it.
As long as this thread
is tied across your wrist
you must not reveal your past
to your husband.
No.
What devotion is it,
that nurses a secret within?
And what matrimony is it,
that has no devotion?
I must tell my lord the truth.
Kunti.
For a woman, this broach
symbolises her husband
By wearing this in her mane,
she assigns her husband
the highest position
in her life.
But I do not approve
of that tradition.
I shall adorn your hair
with this broach myself
as a symbol of our love
and trust.
Handling a woman's mane
seems harder
than handling a nation.
When it's about
handling a nation
one takes the help of ministers
and the court, your majesty.
But when it's about
arranging my hair
you shall have to
do it yourself.
May I say something, Kunti?
I wished to say something at
your 'Swayamvar'.
But I never got
the opportunity.
I was spellbound by
the question
you put forth at the
Swayamvar'.
That very moment
I prayed inwardly
that my answer be the right one.
Your question was very witty.
Even I began praying the moment
I glanced upon you, my lord
that by god's grace, you answer
my question from your heart.
Were you testing my heart
or my intelligence?
Your heart, my lord.
A human tests
what he wishes to acquire.
You are amazing, Kunti.
You tested my heart
with just one question
and acquired it too.
For a king to surrender himself
to one's will so easily
isn't appropriate, my lord.
It is imperative that one
examines the virtues of
the person wanting to acquire
such a special heart.
Do you not trust my choice?
Or are you just flaunting
your caliber again?
No, my lord.
I...
I just want to
tell you something.
You have to pass the verdict.
A man who tests his wife,
is tested himself in turn.
My married friends tell me so.
That means, I have to
undergo another test.
Tell me.
What is the matter?
My lord...
I wanted to say...
My lord...
I wanted to say...
What is this?
Whose message has arrived
at this hour?
What happened, my lord?
The beat of the drums
conveys a message.
I'm sure, the matter is grave.
I must head to the royal court.
You cannot go to the battle,
Pandu.
You have just been married.
Forgive me, Queen Mother.
My personal pleasure cannot
hinder my sense of duty.
If the need for battle
has arisen
It is my duty to answer it.
I shall command the charges
during the battle, your majesty.
You shall have plenty of battle
opportunities, your majesty.
For a king,
no war is a final one.
But the first battle is
always the first one.
The subjects always have doubts
about a new king's potential,
grandfather.
Pandu must display his strength
at the earliest opportunity.
I beg your pardon, grandfather
but that is my opinion.
I may be blind.
But I know how to wage war.
I shall go instead.
Brother is right, grandfather.
It is our duty to help
the kingdom of Madra.
Whoever has attacked Madra
has done so under the assumption
that I'm a new king
and I'm just married.
I would have neither
the courage, nor the inclination
to help Madra.
The enemy wishes to gauge me.
And I shall undergo the test
put forth by him.
Have you even thought
about Kunti?
She shall be heartbroken.
What will you tell her?
What happened, my lord?
Is it distressing news?
A news that is pleasurable
to one
is perceived to be distressing
by the other.
A husband and a wife
aren't separate, my lord.
They are one.
What is pleasurable to you,
shall be pleasurable to me too.
Tell me, what is the news?
Someone has attacked
our ally nation.
I must go to battle.
This very moment.
Mother and grandfather insisted
that someone else will
proceed with our army.
But I said that this was
the king's duty.
Hence, I shall go to the battle
myself.
I should have consulted you
before coming to this decision.
But...
- No, my lord.
You have taken a decision
that truly befits a king.
If the ruler of Hastinapur
took any other decision
I would be disappointed.
I am aware that a queen would
be gratified.
But I wish to know what
a wife's heart feels.
If you are angry upon me
you have every right
to do so, Kunti.
The first night of our wedding
has brought us separation.
An eclipse always obscures
a full moon.
But after the eclipse,
that very moon
appears more bright and radiant.
I shall wait for you, my lord.
When shall you commence?
Now.
This very moment.
I could have spent the first
night with you and left by dawn.
But that would be my
weakness, Kunti.
And once a person surrenders
to his weakness
he is weakened forever.
I am here to be your strength,
my lord.
I shall not be your weakness.
I am a queen as well.
You shall be victorious
and return soon.
I am confident.
Do you wish to say
something, Kunti?
If something ails your heart,
you may tell me.
No, my lord.
All that my heart possesses
are prayers for you.
May you be victorious.
May you return with a token
of victory from Madrapur.
I shall be waiting for you.
Soldiers...
Har Har Mahadev!*
Hail Lord Shiva!
Har Har Mahadev!
Har Har Mahadev!
Har Har Mahadev!
Proceed.
A few months later...
Waiting is something every queen
is destined for, Kunti.
Turn your wait into
penance.
Not a lament.
Forgive me, sister-in-law.
I do not wish to cause all of
you anguish with my behaviour.
So why have you ceased eating?
What else can I do,
sister-in-law?
Earlier, we would get messages
through the beating of drums.
But now we are not getting any
messages from the battlefield.
No messages being conveyed
mean only one thing, Kunti.
That they have no good news
to convey yet.
But at least there
is an assurance
that there is no bad news too.
But my ears
are craving to hear
the drums, sister-in-law.
We will get a message.
And it shall surely be
good news.
I have complete faith
in Pandu.

Princess of Panchal
what is the meaning
of coming here?
I wanted to ask you a question.
I am not obligated
to answer any of your questions.
Is resolving the issues
of sinners
by showing them
how to purify themselves
not the duty of great men?
You...
The sin committed
by all of you...
What path do I show
all of you to atone for it?
Now, even
the water I give as an offering
is not being accepted
by Surya Dev.
After slipping
through my fingers
the water does not mix
with that of mother Ganga.
Princess
all of you
have committed a grave sin
and Hastinapur is being
punished for it.
Now
what path should I
show all of you?
I can only
show you the path to
the God of Death, Yama.
We are ready to follow
any path you show us
but I have a doubt.
What will Lord Yama
be able to do?
Yama will be able
to purify your tainted souls.
In other words
even after committing
such a grave sin
it is possible for us
to be pure once again?
Do I have the permission
to ask another question?
Is the other name of Lord Yama
not Dharmaraj?*
*Lord of righteousness.
Then is the righteous path
not that of Lord Yama?
You are arguing
with me, Princess.
Had you known righteousness
you would never have
resorted to unrighteousness.
When one does not know
what righteousness is
how can he follow the path
of righteousness then?
That is the solution
I wish to seek from you.
If a soul gets purified
after death
then what is the point?
There must be a way
to follow Lord Yama's path
when one is still alive.
The way Savitri had...
She had brought back
her husband from Lord Yama.
The way Sage Udalak's son
Nachiketa had been
offered to Death
but had returned from
the abode of Lord Yama.
There must be a solution.
The principles followed by Yama
are rules on this earth.
A lotus is born in the mud
but there are
no branches on its stem.
Hence, it does not move sideward
but grows straight up
towards the sky.
This is what rules mean.
One must abide by rules
all his life.
One must deem it sacred.
And how could you believe
that we chose not to
abide by certain rules?
That we did not take an oath
to make our lives sacred?
You may not have faith
in the values imparted to me
and I accept that.
But you could have had faith
in that of the Kuru dynasty.
It is easy for a tree
to grow on a river bank.
However, a desert
is devoid of water
and has the blazing sun.
For a tree to grow there
is its true test.
And my husbands and me
have followed the righteous path
even in such a grave situation.
You say
that because of our
unrighteous deed
your offering is being rejected.
But what if
by doubting the purity
of the sons of Pandu
you have committed
an unrighteous deed?
If my husbands and me
are entirely guiltless,
oh Lord Surya
then do accept this offering.
I have a request, grandsire.
Do not keep the sons of Pandu
deprived of your blessings.
Hear all!
Hear all!
The sons of Pandu
are making their entrance!
Greetings, His Highness.
Greetings, His Highness.
Greetings, grandsire.
May you live long.
Greetings, uncle.
Bless you!
Your Highness
a while ago, as the palace
in Varnavrat had caught fire
we had to flee from there.
That is why, we had decided
to stay away from Hastinapur.
And deeming us dead
you decided to coronate
brother Duryodhan as Prince.
But now, I am here
to serve you
and the entire kingdom.
Uncle
when an old building
is still standing
a new building cannot be
constructed in its place.
Until one harvests
the current crops
one cannot sow
news crops in the field.
That is why, uncle
when the former Crown Prince
is still present
a new Crown Prince
cannot take his place.
I request you
to declare brother Duryodhan's
coronation as Prince
null and void.
I... - Certainly,
brother Yudhishthir.
The truth is,
the moment you returned
my coronation as Prince
became null and void on its own.
For you, I shall give up
this throne of mine.
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir.
Be seated, brother Yudhishthir.
But
answer a question of mine,
Crown Prince.
Despite having a husband
when a woman has
relationships with other men
she is called amoral.
In the other kingdoms
of the Arya region
such a woman gets imprisoned.
If you face this question
in the future
then how will you
uphold justice, Crown Prince?
I have another question.
In our kingdom
no matter how gallant
the General is
if he is proved to be amoral
then he gets punished!
If the judge is amoral
then the King punishes him too!
If the Crown Prince
or his wife is amoral
then would punishing them
be correct
or not?
No amoral person is ever given a
position in the state politics!
The position of a Crown Prince
is a sacred
and stately one.
So, would letting
an amoral person
preside over it be correct?
Answer my questions,
Crown Prince.
And Your Highness
you must then
let justice prevail.
I can answer your questions,
brother Duryodhan.
No need to do that, Yudhishthir!
I banish you and your family
from the kingdom this instant!
A message from
the King of Gandhar?
Purandiri, the King of Gandhar
has sent a message.
We must set the palace
on fire tonight itself.
Then...
Yes, we will have to poison
their meal tonight itself.
If they are alive
they might escape easily when
they see the palace on fire.
Bring the vessel of poison
I gave to you at once.
Certainly, My Lord.
Purochan!
What...
What is it, Prince?
What are all of you doing?
W- We are...
We are preparing tonight's meal.
Y- Yes.
It is way past dinner time.
Are you not done with it yet?
Indeed, Prince. We shall
serve the meal right away.
Do proceed to
the dining chamber.
You do not follow any order
given to you, Purochan.
W- What, Prince?
We had told you to construct a
dining chamber inside the palace
but you have not yet
paid heed to it.
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake, Prince.
I shall have one made
tomorrow without fail.
Brother Bheem, wait.
Let us take some 'kheer
for Nakul's mouse
otherwise he will bring it
with him to the dining chamber
and mother will be unable
to have her meal.
That's a splendid idea.
Bring a small bowl, Purochan.
Purochan!
Bring a small bowl!
We want some 'kheer...
T- That...
What is that substance
on the 'kheer?
Herbs. - Potion...
- Syrup.
In other words
it is a syrup made
from selected flowers.
It has an odd smell.
It is excellent
for digestion, Prince.
That is why, it is used
in preparing 'kheer.
The meal shall not
have an odd smell, Prince.
Not one bit.
Alright. Make sure the taste
is not compromised.
Certainly.
Brother Bheem
you forgot to take the 'kheer.
- Oh yes.
Purochan, bring some 'kheer
in a small bowl.
Certainly, Prince.
Purandiri.
- What?
Certainly.
Here you go.
But father, what if the Pandavas
don't eat the 'kheer' themselves
but feed it to
the mouse instead?
It will die.
What happened?
Why do you seem so tense?
Are you famished like me?
No, brother Bheem.
No other person can ever
have an appetite like yours.
But... But something
ominous is going to happen.
I have such a premonition.
Purochan's wife
prepares the meals.
It is bound to be ominous.
Who knows what she adds
to the meals.
I feel, Purochan's entire
family is ominous.
He has constructed
such a strange palace.
It looks stunning
but the entire palace
reeks of something.
We should ask Purochan about it.
But only after having our meal.
Once I see food,
I cannot control myself.
Go on. Go and call brother
Yudhishthir, Arjun and Nakul.
And if you do not reach on time,
I shall begin eating.
Certainly, brother.
You may begin eating.
Besides, you eat
for three hours.
And we end up
just sitting there with you.
Go on.
Purochan.
What is it, Prince? - If you
keep standing at the door
you will turn into a festoon
hung over doorways.
Come on. Make haste.
Serve the meal.
But Prince, the Crown Prince and
Her Highness are not yet here.
They will be here.
Just serve the meal.
Prince, do pardon me.
How can you begin eating
without Her Highness?
She has ordered me
to begin eating without her.
But Prince, we have prepared
quite a feast today.
If you eat with your family,
it will give us great joy.
Give me that.
I will eat not only with her
but also after she is done.
Place the other vessels
over there. - Certainly, Prince.
Let's go.
Mother!
Brother Yudhishthir!
I am awaiting for all of you!
They ought to begin
eating together, My Lord.
If he begins eating
before the others arrive
the poison will start
showing its effect on him
and our plan will be foiled.
Stop him from eating, My Lord.
But how do I stop him?
How odd!
Every animal feels calm
in my presence
but why is it so restless?
Nakul
maybe your mouse is hungry.
Here is some 'kheer' for it.
Brother Arjun, mother is
awaiting us for the meal.
Why? Will brother Bheem
not wait for us?
Nakul
do come for dinner
after feeding your mouse.
But it refuses to eat.
- How odd!
Where do you wish to go, mouse?
Maybe it is anxious to fulfill
the task it came here for.
Then we will know why
uncle Vidur sent us a mouse.
Nakul, let it go.
Let's see where it goes.
What is it, brother Arjun?
Lac has been used instead
of bricks in the palace.
Lac has been used instead
of bricks in the palace.
Why has this palace been
constructed this way, brother?
You may not know this, Nakul
but lac is extremely flammable.
Along with lac,
this palace is made
with dried grass,
clarified butter and cotton.
If this palace catches fire
everything will get burnt
within six hours.
But why?
This is a conspiracy.
Greetings, Her Highness.
Bless you.
Greetings, mother.
- Bless you, Bheem.
Where is Yudhishthir
and the rest of your brothers?
Mother, instead of
having a meal with me
my brothers find feeding
a mouse more interesting.
Bheem, you may begin eating.
I shall await for the rest.
Alright, mother.
Father
the remaining Pandavas
have figured out
that the entire palace
is made of lac.
This is a scheme to burn
us alive in the palace.
Aiming at a higher goal
when you wish
the death of Bhishma
you will certainly become
the reason of his demise.
Then I do not wish to live but
I shall return in my next life.
And when even your soul
is fatigued and aged
I shall come to you
as your doom.
I shall hear the footsteps
of death approaching you
Bhishma!
Even when a woman takes
to arms in the battlefield
can any man
ever strike at her?
Women will not be able
to participate in this war.
None of these pyres
belong to you.
Numerous young soldiers
will die on these in exchange
for a handful of coins.
Widowed women
will try to gather what is left
of their husbands from these.
Countless mothers will be seen
trying to safeguard
the severed heads of their sons
from hungry swine and foxes
while crying bitterly.
When a crow or vulture
will pluck out the eyes
of a nearly dead soldier
the screams of wounded soldiers
will drive a stake
through everyone's heart.
This land will consume the
future of countless children.
Robbed of their fathers
children will cry silently
for the rest of their lives.
However,
one aged man
will mock their misery
and stand right here
bearing the sins of his life.
In this very Kurukshetra!
Because he deems
his life quite lovely.
In order to stay alive
at this age
is this the web of treachery
you are weaving Bhishma?
The Almighty is my witness,
Lady Amba.
I have never engaged
in any treachery in my life.
Neither for power nor property.
Neither for affection nor life.
It was not my proposal
to bar women
from taking part in the war.
And this was not
my decision either.
That is a lie!
You are deceitful.
You are wily and treacherous!
Did you forget the promise
you made to Lord Shiva, Bhishma?
I burnt myself in a pyre as Amba
and that fire is still burning
within Shikhandini
because of you, Devavrat.
Because of you!
My life
my wishes
my happiness and my dreams
were destroyed by you, Bhishma!
Just take a look around you.
Look, Bhishma!
Take a look around you!
This war was born
from the dejection of the woman
who has spent her entire life by
covering her eyes with a cloth
whether she says so
explicitly or not.
This war was born from
the anger of her brother
whether you believe it or not!
And you are responsible
for all this, Bhishma.
Yet you have such greed to live!
How do you gather the courage
to even look at your reflection
in the mirror,
Bhishma?!
Does it not kill you with shame?
That too is your misfortune,
Bhishma.
Until I confront you
you cannot die.
Lady Amba
you had said
that when fatigue will
weigh down even my soul
you will come to me.
I am experiencing
that fatigue today.
These crutches
these herbs
these pyres...
All this is a celebration
of death amidst life.
My soul is dying
to have liberation
but I am helpless,
Lady Amba.
Until you return as a man
you will not be able
to enter this battlefield.
I will indeed enter
this battlefield.
I will indeed have
my revenge, Bhishma!
In this very life!
In this very battlefield.
But before that, you must
experience your misfortune.
You will have to annihilate your
dynasty with your own hands.
Upon seeing the Kurus bleed
you will cry tears of blood.
Your misery is not yet over,
Bhishma.
Your heart will plead
to the Almighty for liberation.
Your weak soul will not be able
to bear the weight of your body.
Neither will your arms move
to greet someone
nor will your feet
allow you to march.
You will be rooted to the ground
and will be anxious to hear
the footsteps of death!
Await your liberation!
Await your death!
Await me!
Two Days Before the War.
Greetings, father.
Bless you.
In the darkness of life
thinking of you has always
illuminated the path to me.
But today...
Today, in order to dispel
the darkness within me
I require your light, father.
Only your duties can dispel
the darkness within you, dear.
While discharging your duties
if someone tries
to obstruct your path
then be cautious.
Do not fall for his deception.
With this hope, I have come
to seek charity from you, son.
That is not called charity,
My Lord.
That is the right
of every parent.
When someone has
the right to bless others
how can he ask
for something from me?
I ask for just one thing
as charity.
Henceforth, do not engage
in any more charity, son.
I have taken an oath,
father
that after offering you water
early in the morning
if one asks me for something
over which I have a right
then I indeed give it away.
A river that descends a mountain
never ascends it.
I too cannot break my oath,
father.
Besides, when you yourself
are protecting someone
how can anyone
ever deceive that person?
Do not forget that your enemies
are the blessings of other Gods.
And these Gods are hoping
for the victory
and success of their sons.
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra
will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra
will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.
My armour and ear-rings!
- Yes, son.
These make you immortal
and denote
your divinity as well.
Without them,
the weapons of Arjun
will be able
to pierce your body.
But will the weapons of Arjun
be able to reach my body,
father?
If the statue of God
is sculpted from a rock
then it denotes
the divinity of the rock
and not its toughness.
My competence lies in my arms!
It lies in my archery, father!
For being concerned for my life
I shall always
be indebted to you.
However, to me
my oath is more important
than my life.
By slaying Arjun,
I will show the entire world
that competence is not born in a
specific dynasty, clan or sect.
Competence is born
in the soul of a human being.
If Lord Indra does not know this
and even his son
is more scared of my armour
than my archery
then I shall take my armour
and give it away willingly,
father.
I, Susharma,
King of Trigartha
pledge my weapons to you,
General Bhishma.
In this war,
my army and I
shall deem every order
of yours our duty.
If any of us
disobeys your orders
then may we meet with our doom.
Duryodhan
King Karna of Anga has not yet
pledged his loyalty to me.
Grandsire
all these warriors
are independent.
That is why,
they can
pledge their loyalty
to anyone they like.
Friend Karna says
that his loyalty lies with me.
That is why,
his loyalty
cannot lie with anyone else.
In the battlefield
the orders of a General
are paramount.
And every soldier
will have to pledge his loyalty
to the General.
Do not forget
that along with you
the responsibility of security
of all the Kings present here
is on me.
Tell your friend Karna
that before the war begins
he must pledge
his loyalty to me.
King Karna of Anga.
Greetings,
King of Gandhar.
Greetings.
You have to pledge your loyalty
to His Excellency Bhishma
tomorrow at dawn.
Is that
an order of the Crown Prince?
No.
It is the intransigence
of His Excellency Bhishma.
But for this war
the contentment of
His Excellency Bhishma
is quite important.
The freedom of my friend
and him fighting according
to my wishes
is more important to me,
uncle.
My darling
even an ordinary soldier knows
that a mightier warrior
than His Excellency Bhishma
does not exist
in the entire world.
Only because he is on our side
is our victory certain.
I have conquered numerous
regions, King of Gandhar.
When the time comes,
I will prove
that my competence
is not less than that of
His Excellency Bhishma.
In his conquests
friend Karna has defeated
numerous Kings, uncle.
Their soldiers have seen
how the armour of my friend
renders their weapons powerless.
More than the competence
of His Excellency Bhishma
I have
faith in the armour
of my friend, uncle.
Friend
the Pandavas and their army
can be defeated by me
even without my armour.
I know,
friend Karna
that your competence
does not lie in your armour
but in your armour
lies my protection.
Your armour has the power
to withstand even a Brahmastra.
If the Pandavas
attack me with a weapon
then this holy armour of yours
will protect me like a fort,
friend Karna.
Friend Karna
As long as you bear your armour
and stand before me
it is impossible to kill me.
This armour of yours makes
you invincible, friend.
However,
it makes me immortal.
Your holy armour is
undoubtedly important to you.
However,
it is
more important to me,
friend.
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra
will come to you to ask for
your ear-rings and armour.
Sons of Pandu, my blessings 
are with you!
Establish justice.
Slay me!
May you be victorious!
Liberate your Grandsire, Arjun!
Put an end to his troubles!
"It is your duty that you all
engage in the battle with honesty!"
"If you have to make
any sacrifice"
"do so, with a smile on your faces."
"Therefore, slaying me
is your duty."
"If any of you step back
from this duty of yours"
"it shall break my heart!"
"You must abide this order 
of your Grandsire!"
"Even though your hearts quiver"
"while slaying me"
"your hands should not,
my lads!"
Grant me redemption, Arjun!
Redemption!
"Your family shall punish you!"
"All the sins committed by you"
"shall pierce your body like arrows,
Bheeshma!"
"You shall writhe in agony
lying in an array of arrows!"
"And at that moment I shall
be present there!"
What have we done, Grandsire Bheeshma?
What sin have I committed?
What twist of fate is this?
What twist of fate is this?
That I...
...That I was compelled to raise 
my arms against you?
Grandsire!
Today... Today I have opened
the gates of hell for myself!
I have betrayed my ancestors!
I have tainted my race!
And...
And I have strangled 
my morals, Grandsire!
Why... Why didn't my arms break
before doing this?
Why didn't my arms break?
Why didn't my eyes lose 
their sight, Grandsire?
Arjun, my lad!
I am alright!
You have only abided
by my orders!
The lamp that burns
after sunrise...
does not generate illumination.
That lamp...
only creates soot.
The burning of such a lamp
is futile!
No, Grandsire!
It is better to extinguish
that lamp!
No, Grandsire!
Arjun, my lad!
That lamp...
cannot extinguish itself.
And this favour which seems harsh,
has to be committed by someone else.
Even my life...
is futile now, my lad!
It is futile.
No, grandsire.
Your life is not futile.
I am in need of your guidance,
grandsire!
We all are in need of your guidance!
Justice is the path for everyone.
And one's mind is his guide.
Anyone can give you advice...
my lad. But...
No one can offer you guidance.
You all are capable of knowing
the path of truth.
Now do not mourn, my lads!
Do not mourn!
But, Grandsire.
As long as you are alive...
Our childhood shall be alive in our hearts!
After your demise
our laughter shall fade.
Worldly worries shall torment
our hearts, grandsire!
It is our selfishness
That we cannot let you die!
That we cannot let you die, Grandsire!
Our divine medicines,
can heal all of grandsire's
wound before dawn, borther!
Let's take grandsire
to our encampment!
Nakul, my lad!
Do not bind me now!
But, Grandsire. All your oaths
are fulfilled now!
You even laid down your weapons yourself!
Now there are no restraints upon you!
Then why are you adamant,
upon giving up your life?
Because you are adamant upon saving me, Arjun.
Your adamancy shall become
my restraint.
Lord Shri Krishna.
Opened my eyes in a moment!
Seek his guidance, Arjun!
All your restraints shall be undone.
This isn't desire,
Grandsire!
This is love.
Desire tries to restrain others!
And love...
Love binds itself to others.
Even saints have the
right to love, Grandsire!
All your life you have suffered.
The agony of restraints!
Now you have the chance.
To stay alive and enjoy liberty!
No, Krishna!
As long as I was alive I
never let injustice happen.
And justice as well.
I had hindered justice.
And injustice too!
In reality,
I had stubbornly,
halted the progress of time.
Therefore,
I never let time performs its function.
So you killed him!
You killed my Grandsire,
woeful Arjun!
Is this your justice?
Even the one who cuts a
tree is called a criminal!
But you severed the very roots 
of my family.
Yudhishtir, you are brute!
Are you so greedy to 
acquire the throne?
Brother Duryodhan!
This is time to bid
Grandsire a final farewell.
I can bid my Grandsire
a final farewell in just one way!
I shall lay your severed
head at my Grandsire's feet!
Duryodhan!
The sun has set! 
You cannot attack now!
Yes!
The sun has set!
The sun has set upon the 
Kuru clan, Bheem!
And this has happened due
to this vile Arjun!
I shall end your life right now, Arjun!
If there is even an inkling
of justice left in your heart.
Then accept the punishment for this crime!
Arjun!
Guru Drona!
Who are you?
- Eklavya.
Are you a tribal?
Do you come from the forest?
Have you come from
a different state?
And from whom did you learn
such extraordinary archery?
The one who has been
teaching you, prince.
Guru Drona!
That's a lie!
Child, I never accepted
you as my student.
Who are you?
Greetings, Sire.
I am the son of Nishaad, the
king of the forests of Magadha
Eklavya.
I secretly listen to your
teachings throughout the day
and practice the same
during the night
in front of your statue here.
How is that possible?
No one can call his ordinary
skills as a gift from me
and insult me.
Before calling me
your Guru
one has to prove his eligibility
to become my student.
Sire...
Whatever I have learnt till now
with your blessings
will prove my eligibility.
What have you learnt?
Ashwathama, my friend
two stones of the same
size and strength
what happens when they
collide with each other?
Both would break.
Have you understood anything?
He is the answer to Arjun.
Knowledge can be acquired
only by dedication.
All of us know that.
But what is the actual
importance of dedication?
Have we ever thought about it?
A human mind
always faces obstacles in the
process of acquiring knowledge.
Sometimes a student is jealous
of another student.
Sometimes one doubts
the teachings.
And sometimes the punishment
given by a teacher
fills the mind with fury.
No? Doesn't that happen?
Several thoughts
distract the mind.
And due to such an
unstable state of mind
we are unable to
acquire knowledge.
A mind become stable
only with dedication.
Dedication destroys the
arrogance of a human being.
It eliminates feelings like
jealousy, ambition
it calms the heart and helps
the mind concentrate.
In reality
there is no limit for knowledge
in the creation of God
nor that of knowledgeable
people.
Guru Dattatray*
*A Hindu deity encompassing the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, collectively known as Trimurti. Teacher of Parashurama.
derived knowledge
from a cow and a dog.
In other words
whether it's about
spiritual knowledge
or knowledge about life
or the knowledge derived
at a hermitage
to acquire it
more than the teacher
our dedication towards
the teacher is more important.
Isn't that true?
Think about it.
I am the son of Nishaad, the
king of the forests of Magadha
Eklavya.
And from whom did you learn
such extraordinary archery?
The one who has been
teaching you, prince.
Witnessing Eklavya's
archery skills
Arjun's self confidence
has shattered.
Look at his state.
If the boy has become
so magnificent
in spite of watching
from a distance
then think
if he stays at the hermitage
and learns
what a great archer
he would become.
My Lord.
I have been observing
that after meeting
the boy from the forest
you seem to be in a dilemma.
You stopped eating and
sleeping altogether.
What is bothering you?
Right now, for me, justice
is injustice.
I am unable to
understand my duties.
Arjun, for the past two days
and two nights
you have been practicing
without rest.
Now stop it.
- No, brother.
Eklavya, just by sitting near
Guru Drona's statue
could learn everything
and I couldn't learn
anything in spite of staying
with Guru Drona.
Brother, I am sure there is
something lacking in my efforts.
Unless I do not acquire
knowledge like Eklavya
until then I will not
stop practicing.
Come on.
Come.
If Eklavya becomes our friend
we wouldn't need to
be scared of Arjun.
Dushasan is right.
He can become the commander
of our army.
Ashwathama, even if
Arjun practices all his life
the sons of Pandu
won't be stronger than us.
I will personally
speak to Eklavya.
But how can I stay
at Hastinapur?
My knowledge is for Magadha.
Sure. But to help your
friend for some time
I am sure you can
stay at Hastinapur.
Once I get the kingdom
you can go back to Magadha.
Sire!
Sire!
Where is Guru Drona?
And if you promise
I'll request my father to give
you a place at the hermitage
My father always listens to
me, Eklavya.
Of course.
I agree to everything
my son says.
You have established me
as your Guru
so now, I have to accept
you as my student.
But dear, I have a question.
Would you be able to give
an offering to your teacher?
Absolutely, Sire.
I will give you
whatever you desire.
Until I do not make
an offering to you
I will not use the skills
I learned from you.
Right now...
You will have to give it
immediately.
Command me, Sire.
As an offering you will give me
the thumb of your right hand.
As an offering you will give me
the thumb of your right hand.
Would you be able to do that?
Your dedication
pleases me, dear.
Hereafter, you are my student.
Now you should leave
the land of Hastinapur
and return to Magadha.
Right now.
Your teacher commands you.
I'm sure Shakuni is
concocting a plot
on the pretext of celebrations.
I suggest that
we go to Hastinapur.
The one who is plotting
would get a hard blow
of my fist.
He would tremble in fear then.
Dices can be an answer
in the game of gambling.
We won't be able to resort
to a fight there.
But when uncle has
suggested us
not to accept the invitation
why should we go to Hastinapur
and fight with them.
A King can never refuse
for a fight and its initiation.
A ruling King can always express
his helplessness, Yudhisthir.
Tell them,
that you don't have time.
No, uncle.
Uncle Dhritarashtra
is a father figure for me.
His invitation
is an order for me.
But, My King
the way to an unknown domain
is all the more difficult.
When we don't know about
the plans of King of Gandhar
how are we going
to counter it?
Plans?
What can be his plan, Panchali?
Maybe, his eyes are
set on our property.
Maybe, he wants to
reign our kingdom.
He can take it all
if that's what he wants.
Do we give up on our rights
just because someone's
plotting against us?
Do we give up on our kingdom
which we have built after
much hard work?
This isn't just, brother.
Bheem, no one has
actual rights on this land
and we are no exception.
Just the way
a fish inhales water
and then exhales it.
Neither does it accepts
water into its system
nor does it reject it.
In the same way, human beings
own a piece of land while alive
but eventually,
have to leave it behind.
We were born in the jungle
and are now,
ruling this kingdom.
Maybe, in future,
we go back to the jungle.
This kingdom isn't ours
for a lifetime
but our pride is
and so is our self-confidence.
We can't let go of our pride
and self-confidence
in the wake of a battle.
It's not just about
the kingdom, My King.
I fear
that if in this game
we play to protect our honour
we will lose our piousness.
And if we protect our piousness
we will lose everything
that we have.
If we protect our piousness,
Panchali
we will be able to get back
all that we lose.
Even if we lose this kingdom
we will build a new kingdom
somewhere else.
But I can't refuse
uncle Dhritarashtra's order.
Uncle
I will definitely go
to Hastinapur.
And if uncle Dhritashtra
orders me
I will surely gamble.
They have entered this place
just the way a fawn
enters the mouth of a python.
They have come with their pride
just to have it
squashed by us.
Their arrival was inevitable,
my child.
When you make the right move
you can compel others
to give
in to your wish.
Let's go and welcome them.
While welcoming the
sovereign king, Yudhisthir
don't forget
to be humble
to him.
For the last time.
May you be happy always.
It's a tradition
that wherever
a sovereign king goes
his wish should be asked for,
firstly.
So tell me,
what your wish is.
King"
I just have one wish, uncle.
For a moment, forget that
I'm a sovereign king
and let me take
your blessings.
No, dear.
A sovereign king
never seeks anyone's blessings.
A coconut tree,
though, is important
it's the coconut
that comes to use
and used in prayers.
In the same way,
neither a father
nor an uncle
is as important as
a sovereign king.
In more than 500 years,
none of the kings from
Kuru dynasty could get
the title of a sovereign king.
I'm really proud of you, dear.
But, today just let me be a
happy and a proud uncle.
I seek your blessings, King.
May you be happy,
brother Duryodhan.
Order brother-in-law Duryodhan
to drop his weapons.
To take away weapons
from a warrior
is deemed
a fitting punishment.
Confiscate brother Duryodhan,
brother Dushyashan
and King of Anga's weapons.
I seek your blessings, Queen.
May God bless you,
Prince Duryodhan.
The court of Hastinapur
may be inferior
when compared to your
pride and rights.
Do we need to spruce up
Hastinapur's court for you or...
Do we need to spruce up
Hastinapur's court for you or...
Or?
Or
do we need to apologise
to you
if something lacks
in our hospitality?
King!
Please come in,
if you wish to.
We have arranged a grand
welcome for you
at the court of Hastinapur.
Shall we, dear?
Let's go, uncle.
Welcome.
Queen...
If you wish, we can first
visit the family deity's temple.
After which, you can
enter the court.
As you say,
Queen mother.
Is the snake letting go
of its venom
or is it the venom that's
forsaking the snake?
Why are we being given
so much respect?
A sacrificial lamb is fed well
before it could be sacrificed.
We should stay alert, brother.
Don't worry, Nakul.
As long as Grand Sire
Bhishma is with us
he won't let any harm
befall us.
Let's proceed.
What happened, Sahdev?
I'm getting
a sense of foreboding.
Today, this court is going
to witness an injustice
that has never taken place
in the history of mankind.
Don't worry, Sahdev.
Grand Sire, Sir Drona,
uncle Dhritarashtra
and uncle Vidur are here.
Queen mother's here
and so is our mother.
On seeing an injustice
taking place
they won't remain silent.
Brother Arjun
adversity is when
the rope you hold
for your support
actually turns out
to be a snake.
I fear
that everyone's going
to be a silent spectator today.
Brother Arjun
adversity is when
the rope you hold
for your support
actually turns out
to be a snake.
I fear
that everyone's going
to be a silent spectator today.
Grand Sire, you look worried.
Yes, Vidur.
I'm worried about the fact
that in this game of gambling
Shakuni is surely
going to cheat.
Looking at the splendour
of Indraprastha
Duryodhan is envious.
He wants
the kingdom of Pandavas
by hook or crook.
The reason for my worry
is the same, Grand Sire.
Grand Sire
please try and stop this game
of gambling from taking place.
My rights and my powers
have been subdued, Vidur.
A throne made of sand
remains intact
until someone sits on it.
But Pandavas
with their hard work
have built Indraprastha.
And I...
I won't let anyone deprive
them of their rights.
I must speak to Duryodhan.
The final say should
be ours today, uncle.
I'm sure it will be, my child.
The Pandavas would
be defeated so badly
that they would never be able
to come to terms with it.
Their kingdom, their army
their property...
Take it all
away from them, uncle.
Is that it?
My children
I'm going to
crush their pride.
Those who don't
have a reason
to be proud of themselves
are actually
the ones who are defeated.
How are we going
to do that, uncle?
We will make them
your servants.
That won't suffice, uncle.
We will make their wife
our handmaiden.
She made us part with our
weapons in their court
we are going to unclothe her
in our court, before all.
Uncle.
Greetings!
Bless you, Kunti!
You seem worried.
Come.
I come here
to put a burden on your 
shoulder, uncle.
No one is more capable than you
whose shoulder can withstand 
the weight of this world.
For a youth, the world's burden
brings honor.
And to have such burden
brings about joy.
After a while,
that burden becomes duty.
And assuming such duty 
becomes one's pride.
After that the world's burden
becomes responsibility.
And assuming that responsibility
brings one's satisfaction.
However at my age now
the world's burden
is punishment.
My shoulder can lift
a mountain.
However my heart,
my heart has no strength to lift
the burden of responsibility anymore.
But this is my last request, uncle.
I...
I have Ganges water,
on the one hand,
and 'Panchamrit'* on the other...
*A mixture of five foods used in Hindu worship and puja, usually honey, sugar, milk, yogurt, and ghee.
Which one should I throw away
and which one should I keep, uncle?
You are greedy to hold both of them,
but how was it came to be, Kunti?
Both Arjun and Karna
bound by their oath.
I know about your secret, Kunti.
Please forgive me, uncle.
I made a mistake during my youth
and I repent for this.
Then why are you telling 
me now, Kunti?
Because
Karna and Arjun had taken oath 
to slay each other.
And just thinking about it,
is like pushing a stake 
through my heart.
Karna fights for the unrighteous people,
but there is still truth in his heart, uncle.
Please protect them both, uncle.
Protecting Karna is not 
my responsibility
and Arjun do not need protection.
But
Karna is also your grandchild, uncle.
Only children with the consent of 
your husband
are my grandchildren.
But before you got married
any child you have
do not belong to Kuru dynasty.
I understand what's in your mind, Kunti.
Suffering is also part of my destiny
but
I'll try to sefeguard you from it.
Bless you, Kunti.
Dusshasan
regardless of gransire's battle formation
tomorrow on the battlefield
you have to stay in the middle 
of the formation.
with the rest of our brothers.
Protection from grandsire
will provide security
for me.
No, friend.
Protecting you is my responsibility, friend.
All weapons directed at you
will have to go through me first.
Of course, King of Anga,
certainly.
Previously, weapons will only bouncing 
off of your armour
but now they will go through you.
King of Gandhar!
Do you doubt my competence?
- No, King of Anga!
Now we only have faith on 
your competence
because you gave away your 
divinity as charity.
Is this what you call dedication?!
The truth is
if you really concern with the safety 
of your friend
then you will not risk the life 
of your friend
just to uphold your righteousness
and end up at a loss like this.
My dear.
My dear.
Karna, King of Anga
should be relieved from the task
of protecting you.
When one can not even protect one's 
own life from enemy's arrows
how can he protect you?
I... 
- Karna, King of Anga
if you like you may leave
this war.
And we hope
that the first arrow of Arjuna
will not end your life.
King of Gandhar!
Now Arjuna's arrows
will be able to hurt the King of Anga.
Because of that
he is prohibited to enter the battlefield.
What do you mean, grandsire?!
A warrior who has not
pledged his loyalty to his general
can not be
allowed to enter the battlefield.
All my life
I have dreamt to prove my competence 
in the battlefield.
I have gone through difficult trials 
to join this war.
I have taken an oath
to protect my friend.
And it is the purpose of my life.
You do not have the right
to smash my dream
cause this is the only way to prove it.
It's not my responsibilty to let you
proof yourself to the khsatriyas, 
Karna, King of Anga.
Uncle!
No one can stop my friend
to enter the battlefield!
If that's the case
then give
the responsibility to protect you
and the other princes
to the King of Anga
because if he goes to war
then I'm not going to fight.
My dear
Karna, King of Anga
can not even protect himself  
from enemy's arrows,
then how can he protect 
your army?
Uncle!
Do not insult my friend.
Strength lies in attack and how 
to counter it.
Sincerity and protection have no 
strength at all.
My friend's competence
do not require a suit of armor, uncle.
When the time comes
sunlight can change all the water
on the earth to steam, uncle.
Just like my friend's bow
can wipe out the whole enemy, uncle.
Dear
I do not wish to doubt your faith
but if one's beaten on the battlefield
then one's loses one's life!
We can't gamble on the battlefield.
Uncle, I've made my decision!
My friend
will combat on the battlefield tomorrow.
Then listen carefully to my final decision, 
Crown Prince Duryodhana,
Until I lead the army
your friend will not enter 
the battlefield.
If that's your decision, uncle
then listen to mine as well.
You should resign your position.
My friend
will be made the next general.
Friend
to show me such respect
you have made me owe you.
However, in my opinion
you don't have to argue with 
his excellency.
You need him, friend.
I need you more, Karna, my friend.
This is what grandsire wants
to protect the Pandavas.
The truth is
that grandsire and Guru Drona
never want to kill the Pandavas!
It is possible
the Pandavas will only be taken 
captive by them!
And imprisoning those five 
in this war
is not my intention, 
friend Karna.
The very purpose of 
this war is to
kill my enemies, 
friend Karna!
And they will only be killed...
only be killed by you, 
my friend.
The truth is the only one who will strive for 
the sake of my success
is only you.
Let's go friend, before 
making a decision
there's something important 
for you to see.
Listen to them, friend.
There is only one name
in their hearts, friend.
Their dedication until death
and unwavering faith
stem neither because you nor I.
They have come here to 
put their life at stake
simply because His Excellency 
Bhisma is here.
The war will begin when the sun rise 
tomorrow, friend.
And the power of an ordinary soldier
lies not only in his ability
or his courage.
His power rooted in his faith.
A soldier goes forward in the battlefield 
with a faith
that his general would 
protect his life.
And all their faith
rest in His Excellency Bhisma.
I'm afraid
that if His Excellency Bhishma resigns
then none of them will 
take part in this war.
Not only that, friend.
After His Excellency Bhisma,
you must elect Guru Drona 
as general.
Only after their death
will you to appoint me as general.
But Grandsire Bhisma has a boon 
to die at his will, friend.
How can he be killed?
To protect Hastinapura
and its crown prince
is an oath he took.
Until he dies
the hundred Kauravas will not die.
And you will always be safe, friend.
Let this war proceeds
as His Excellency Bhisma 
wants it to be.
The enemies are bound to 
get hurt in the process.
If he imprisons Pandavas
then you can give them 
a death sentence.
However if he dies
then I will be there
to help you and realize 
your dreams.
But Karna my friend,
killing Arjuna is also your dream.
This has always happened 
to me, friend.
Whenever I get a chance to prove 
my competence,
fate snatches it away from me.
Sometimes, Surya Dev has set it up 
in heaven.
In other times, fate just left me.
To fulfill your dream
I'm willing to sacrifice millions 
of my dreams, friend.
I will stand outside the battlefield
and waiting for your order.
Obey His Excellency Bhisma's firm order.
Arjun.
Uncle
that is Arjun.
My dear
those four young 'Brahmins...
They are his brothers.
My dear
h-how are those
five people alive?
Today, your fate
stands at a very
dangerous point.
Bheem
if the five of us
are seen together
then everyone will know
who we are.
But brother Yudhishthir
is it not the time
to reveal ourselves?
That decision can be taken
only by mother, Sahadev
and not us.
Bheem.
- Yes.
You must stay with Arjun.
The rest of us shall leave.
We shall wait for you
outside the city.
On my behalf,
you must bless Arjun
and the Princess.
- Do wait for a while, brother.
Just look at how excited
the 'Brahmins' are.
And Nakul might just get married
to one of their daughters.
Yes, Bheem.
That too is one of the fears.
And Nakul might just
not be able to refuse
a marriage proposal like you.
Bless you.
Father
allow your daughter
to leave with her good fortune.
My dear, if a swan enters
the territory of crows
then all the crows
peck that swan to death.
What do you mean?
With the help of all the Kings
and 'Kshatriyas' present here
we need to have
Arjun killed today.
What kind of
a mockery is this?!
What kind of
an insult is it, Kings?
Can the might of the
Kshatriyas' of the Aryan region
be insulted in this manner
in the city of Panchal?!
We are 'Kshatriyas!
We are protectors of the land.
We are nourishers
of the subjects!
The maiden who was
gifted to us by the Gods
will be taken by that
destitute 'Brahmin?
Destitute 'Brahmin.
If a mouse steals a gem
from an elephant's crown
then that does not denote
the greatness of the rodent!
The elephant...
The elephant!
It is the elephant's insult!
Today, as the Princess
got married
to that destitute 'Brahmin
all the Princesses
of the Aryan region
and the 'Kshatriya' maidens
will henceforth,
renounce all the Kings
and marry such
destitute 'Brahmins.
How many times
should we be insulted?!
Pick them up!
Pick up your weapons!
And put an end to this 'Brahmin
and his family.
And punish
the impudent Princess!
Kill that 'Brahmin!
And throw the maiden
into the fire!
Friend.
Do not fight with
Arjun today, friend.
What are you saying,
King of Anga?
The enemy is standing
right before us!
And the enemy has displayed
great valour today, friend.
When lightning strikes
even Chandra Dev hides behind
the clouds momentarily
to honour it.
If we do not honour
someone's competence
then how will we
take pride in ours, friend?
If you ask me to
then I shall take to arms
but I will not be able
to kill Arjun today, friend.
Kshatriyas
we must kill this
Brahmin' today!
If so many 'Kshatriya' Kings
kill us 'Brahmins
then they will commit
the sin of killing 'Brahmins.
You have taken to arms!
To fight you and kill you...
...is our right!
Quit talking, Kings! Attack!
- Attack!
Patukeshwar
why do you not challenge
the King of Gandhar to a fight?
King of Gandhar, where are you?!
Show yourself! I will
behead him this instant!
King of Gandhar!
Patukeshwar, this way.
This way...
King of Gandhar!
You want to fight, correct?
Come here!
You must fight me first.
Come here!
Come here!
Make haste!
My dear
go and kill Arjun and Bheem.
The rest of them
will perish on their own.
Do not ponder, my dear.
This is your opportunity.
Pick up your weapon.
Not today...
Today, you may
savour your victory.
You will certainly get to meet
Lord Yama someday.
Let that
Brahmin' know this.
Crown Prince Dhrishtadyumna
when one invites people
to a ceremony
one must never draw
a weapon on them.
Calm down
Crown Prince.
Kings, Crown Princes
and 'Kshatriyas
I request all of you
to bless this young man
and the Princess
and leave for your
respective kingdoms.
Now, you too should leave,
young 'Brahmin.
The Crown Prince
will arrange for a chariot
and a palanquin for you two.
Indeed! Arrange for
a palanquin for me as well.
I am from the groom's side.
Pardon us, sire
but we will not
take the chariot.
We have taken an oath to walk.
Goodbye.
Stop...
I will complete the rituals
of your marriage.
And you have got that maiden
only because of me.
Do not forget that.
But before the marriage
I must seek the blessings
of my mother.
Then let's proceed.
I shall accompany you.
After all, I was the first
to stand up to protect you.
In other words,
I took the initiative.
Someshwar
carry me now.
Turn around, Someshwar.
Turn around.
Now, all the 'Brahmins
may leave.
This right belongs solely to me.
Bless you.
Allow me to leave, father.
You are allowed to leave,
daughter.
After seeking the blessings
of the 'Brahmin's' mother
you must return soon.
We shall conduct
your marriage here.
Bless you, friend.
The look of joy on your face
gives me great contentment.
I would
like to gift you something.
These five stones.
The gems of
knowledge and patience
are to the right of the stone.
Those of love and dedication
are to the left.
And justice...
Justice is right in the center.
These are the fives bases
of righteousness, Draupadi.
What
do I do with them, Govind?
There are many instances
in one's life, Draupadi
when one is unable
to see the path.
In order to remind oneself
of righteousness
one requires an object.
The decision will always
be yours, Draupadi.
But taking a decision bearing
righteousness in mind
will be easier.
Gather your weapons and courage
and be prepared to fight a war.
We must improve the security
in Virat for this purpose.
In order to harm
Panchali, Subhadra
or Uttara,
what if that wicked
and evil Duryodhan
sends someone to Virat?
That is not necessary,
My Lord.
We women of the Kuru dynasty
will reside
near the battlefield.
Taking care of the supplies
and tending to the injured
will be the responsibility
of us women.
And when you slay
Duryodhan and his brothers
my presence
will make him realize
that he is being punished
and that he is
not dying as a martyr.
This is how
I shall slay you,
Vasudev!
Friend Duryodhan.
What are you doing here?
Is this what you call
friendship?
When that Vasudev was
insulting me in the court
you had taken his side!
You were scared
at the thought of a war!
You, uncle,
that old geyser
and everyone present there
were left terror-stricken!
Calm down,
friend.
I am not scared,
friend
and neither have I forsaken you.
I shall die before you
and that is an oath of mine.
And I
shall indeed fulfil this oath.
A message has been sent.
We need to proceed
towards the battlefield.
Lets go, friend.
Victory awaits you.
My darling
we must head westward towards Samanta Panchaka.*
A vast water reservoir in Kurukshetra (region "kshetra", now in Haryana state).
Have faith.
You have unparalleled might
fighting from your side.
Victory
awaits you.
I, son of Ganga
swear on the purity
of my mother
that I shall never become
the King of Hastinapur
but spend the rest of my life
as its servant!
I shall ensure that your sons
are made the Kings!
I want you to promise me
that under no circumstance
will you quit being on the side
of my sons and me.
As long as you are
the King of Hastinapur
I shall serve you
and Hastinapur as a servant
and deem every word
of yours an order.
While fulfilling the promise
I made to my father
I have given rise to internal
conflicts within my family
Vidur.
In order to maintain
the sanctity of that throne
I have strived endlessly.
However, it got tainted
right before my eyes.
I know
that if this throne
did not have my protection
then Duryodhan would never
have dared to wage a war.
Uncle, you have merely
discharged your duties.
When a strong current
pushes a boat
towards the waterfall
the oarsman has
no fault in it, uncle.
You have always
tried to steer
the boat of Hastinapur
in the right direction.
That was not adequate,
Vidur.
I have seen my father
preside over that throne
and govern this kingdom.
I have seen the effects
of his righteous governance.
During his governance
his subjects were happy
and the Gods were pleased.
Righteousness,
knowledge
and justice
were the bases
of the Kuru kingdom.
And I have firm faith
that even Yudhishthir
will govern the Kuru kingdom
in a similar manner.
And righteousness,
justice and knowledge
will merge into one
on that throne.
However...
However what
saddens me is that I
shall not be able to witness it.
Today...
Today, I am standing before
this throne for the last time.
Uncle
why will you die?
You have been blessed with
the boon to die at will, uncle.
Dear Vidur
as long as I have
a weapon in my hands
the sons of Pandu
cannot win this war.
And I must fight in this war
until the reason of my death
appears before my eyes.
I have the boon to die at will
and now
I also wish to die.
I am contented,
dear Vidur
that the power which can end me
lies in the hands
of the Pandavas.
The army is ready
to march now, uncle.
We brothers and Uttar
are awaiting the next order
with our respective troops.
The General will make
the inspection soon, dear.
Only after that will the army
be ordered to march forth.
I hope you have appointed
Crown Prince Bheem
as the General,
Emperor.
No,
Your Highness
Grandsire Bhishma is
the General of Hastinapur.
Our General has to be someone
who can strip grandsire
of his weapons.
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
Greetings, father!
Give us your blessings,
father.
I am going to pull out
the thorns
from my heart forever.
What blessing
should I give my sons?
It is said that
where there is hope
there is no fear.
However,
the hope of your victory
and the fear of your defeat
have morphed into such an odd
entity in my heart today, son.
that I do not know myself
what blessing
I should give my sons.
In the battlefield
may your valour be unparalleled.
This is my blessing to you.
It will indeed be so,
father.
Not only will our valour
be unparalleled
but also our victory.
Give us your blessings,
mother.
I turned my back to light
in this life of mine.
I never knew the value of lamps.
That is why
I do not know any way to protect
the hundred lamps of mine.
Vindhan.
Vikarna.
Dusshasan...
My sons!
You must ensure
to protect each other!
Dear Duryodhan
please pardon me.
I took an oath without
thinking about the future.
But today,
I have known
that knowledge and solutions
give rise to contentment in life
and joy in the future.
Intransigence and oaths
are merely the paths to sorrow.
My blessing to you is
that may all of you be blessed!
Goodbye, mother.
Goodbye, father.
Greetings,
Guru Drona.
Greetings,
Your Excellency.
Greetings,
Supreme Emperor Yudhishthir.
I asked all of you
to gather here
so that everyone gets to know
that this place
is an exceedingly sacred one.
When Lord Parashuram had
put an end to sinners here
five lakes of blood were formed.
Hence, this place came to be
known as Samanta Panchaka.
To the north of this place
is the River Saraswati
and to its south
is the River Drishadvati.
The place that lies
between these two rivers
has been blessed by the
ancestors of Lord Parashuram.
This is where righteousness
shall be established.
Lord Indra had
blessed Emperor Kuru
saying that anyone who dies
in a battle in this place
shall get a place in heaven.
For your war of righteousness,
this region of righteousness
is most suitable.
Vasudev
Kurukshetra is a region
of righteousness.
Do tell us what the
appropriate day to gather here
with the intent
of a war will be.
My friend Draupadi has
already decided upon that day.
The day the stars
Kritika and Rohini align
during the ninth lunar month on
the 14th day of the waxing moon
is when the war will begin.
In other words, in three days
from now will begin
the Mahabharat.
This peace and satisfaction.
I get it only when I am
with you, Satyavati.
The responsibilities
of the kingdom, war
struggle, schemes,
strategies.
The debate about
justice and injustice.
Everything is just lost
to me.
What more could anyone
wish for, Satyavati?
The desire to live,
Your Highness.
During the time of struggles
we realise
that we are alive.
This means you like struggles
and not peace.
The ones who have
all the pleasures
value peace.
The ones with only peace
would desire
for pleasures first.
And peace is attained
only after struggle
isn't it, King Shantanu?
Satyavati!
What are you doing, Satyavati?
Trying to attain pleasure.
Let it go, Satyavati.
That's a very powerful fish.
You wouldn't able to catch it.
Really?
I'm the daughter of Matysaraj.
Stop, Your Highness!
I place you under an oath.
You shouldn't try to help me.
Leave it, Satyavati.
I will order the fishermen.
They will catch
the fish for you.
I cannot wait until then,
Your Highness!
A fish and an opportunity
should be grabbed
once spotted.
Satyavati!
I wasn't aware that these
delicate hands were so powerful.
King Shantanu, you
are a warrior.
You are the king of a great
kingdom like Hastinapur.
You must be aware that
power doesn't lie in our hands
but instead in our hearts.
A desire is the strength
of the heart.
As much as can be gathered
in the cusp of one's palms
desires stay good only in
that measure, Satyavati.
Your Highness,
God has given us such tiny eyes.
But the same eyes
have the power to see
the limitless skies.
Am I not right, Your Highness?
How can I then humiliate God
by having such humble desires?
Desires, hopes
expectations, ambitions
are the driving forces
of a human society.
Aren't they?
If someone asks you
of your identity
what would be your answer?
Think about it.
You will immediately
realise that your desires
define your life.
The success after
achieving something
and the failure after not
achieving something
describes your identity.
Many people live a life
dying to achieve
many things
but their desires
never do really die.
Desires make them
run around
akin mirages of oasis make
cervids chase them.
But in the very womb
of these desires
lies the light of knowledge.
How?
When the desires are unfulfilled
and they shatter
from the same,
rays of knowledge enter into
the human heart.
No.
This isn't a story about
the battle of desires.
It isn't a story of any horrific
battue born of ambitions.
This story is about
the knowledge which arises
from the womb of desires.
I
Vasudev Krishna
invite all of you join
this journey
which would teach
you the meaning of life.
It will teach you the duty
of a human being.
It would teach you the deeds
to rise and shine from the dirt.
The name of this journey is
Mahabharata.
A village in Hastinapur.
Where are you,
King Shantanu!
Protect your subjects!
Hastinapur has been cursed!
The king has no wife.
The king cannot conduct
a 'yajna'* without a wife.
* Sacrificial ritual.
A kingdom which doesn't
conduct 'yajna
is cursed by the Gods.
Who will now save the
kingdom of Hastinapur?
Pushpak!
Who are you, who has dared
to challenge demon Hida?!
Challenges are thrown
at warriors.
Dacoits are warned, Hida!
Demons like you must
stay at Rakshashvarth.
You are restricted from entering
the realm of the Bharat lineage.
People of the Bharat lineage
chop down forests of our realm.
They attack on our lands.
If that is true
I promise you
hereafter the people of the
Bharat lineage and the demons
wouldn't enter into
each other's lands.
You should free the villagers.
Stop!
How dare you enter into
Shantanu's kingdom, demon?
No demon will be spared now.
Attack!
Stop!
These demons have accepted
our refuge.
Hereafter, they wouldn't
attack the land of Bharat.
And now
no one would attack them.
Who are you to order?
What's the power that
grants you such audacity?
The proof of power
should always be any combat
is not deemed a mandate.
Not with words
but you should prove your
power by your deeds.
How will you protect
the demons?
My army is standing
before them.
There is no way
they could escape.
The river Ganga would
stop flowing.
And the pathway of river Ganga
will become their way.
No one can stop
river Ganga from flowing.
Who are you?
How could Ganga answer
your prayers and stop flowing?
Because not even Lord Shiva
can decline His child's pleas.
Greetings, mother.
Is he your son?
Nof mine but ours, King.
25 years ago when I was taking
our child along with me
I had promised you
that I will make Devarath
capable of becoming your heir.
Devarath, my son.
No, son.
Your place is in my heart.
Son, you do not know
I was waiting for you
day and night.
Your son has been trained by Parashuram* himself, King.
*Rama with the Axe (parashu). The sixth incarnation of Vishnu.
I have fulfilled my promise.
Ganga never falters
from her promises.
I was the unfortunate one
to break the promise
that I had given you.
Else
today you would have been
my wife
and the Queen of Hastinapur.
I has asked for such a promise
that you had to
break sometime.
And about being the queen
then a river is the queen of all
the places that are her shores.
Mother.
I am not distancing from you.
Whenever you call me
I will appear before you.
Leave. Now you should
go with your father.
The purpose of your
life is to serve him.
As you command, mother.
Look, King Shantanu
is coming this way!
Your Highness?
King Shantanu
what is Hastinapur
celebrating today?
Satyavati, my son has
returned today.
25 years ago
Ganga had married me in
the form of a woman.
After our son Devarath was born
she took him away.
But she had promised me
that once our son is
capable enough
she would bring him to me.
And today
she has fulfilled the promise,
Satyavati.
Today he will be enthroned
as the crown prince.
Sa...
Satyavati?
Let's go, Satyavati.
I am here to take you.
Why are you staring
at me, Satyavati?
Your Highness, I was looking
at your face.
Every day, you are happy
when you meet me.
But today
you have brought happiness
along with you.
You are right.
I am very happy today.
I will announce Devarath
as the king very soon.
After that
I relieve myself of all
the responsibilities
to spend the rest of
my life happily with you.
Will you keep me happy,
by being my wife?
Sure, Your Highness.
To love someone makes
a woman the most happy.
To achieve someone's love
is her biggest fortune.
I am blessed to have achieved
your love, Your Highness.
I
have no other desires,
Your Highness.
We would have a home
by this riverbank.
You will hunt fishes.
I will go and sell them
in the city.
What makes you laugh,
Your Highness?
I wonder if,
the Queen of Hastinapur
sells fishes on the roads
of Hastinapur
what would the countrymen think?
King, isn't a queen someone
whose son is entitled
to the throne?
Others are considered
as mere maids.
Rather than surviving as a maid
in the palace of Hastinapur
it's better I choose
fishing as my occupation, like
my father and spend our lives.
Your Highness, I hadn't loved
you having any expectations.
But my self-respect
is very dear to me.
Because after becoming your wife
my dignity would be
your dignity, Your Highness.
I tremble by the thought
of our future, Your Highness.
When Devarath's wife
comes to Hastinapur
what would be my plight,
Your Highness?
Here, I am the daughter
of the king of fishermen.
But at Hastinapur
I will be a stepmother
to the King of Hastinapur.
And when a stepson
is given the ruling authority
the state of a stepmother
is worse than a maid.
What would be
the plight of my sons?
They would only be serving
the king of Hastinapur.
Your Highness, let alone
saplings in the shade of trees
even grass is absent.
I cannot seize Devarath's rights
and hand it over to you sons.
But, Your Highness
Devarath has arrived recently.
I had not known about
his existence until now.
But when you promised to make
me the Queen of Hastinapur
my sons were already awarded
the rights to become the prince.
What are you rambling about,
Satyavati?!
Devarath will become
the prince of Hastinapur!
In that case, I would
be helpless, Your Highness.
You should coronate your son
and then you can come here.
But I would stay at Hastinapur
only as the Queen.
The greed for a golden fish
eventually led your hands
to bleed, Satyavati.
This greed
would make your heart bleed.
Hail the King!
- Hail!
Father.
Aren't you keeping well?
I am fine, son.
But your face...
- It's nothing.
Subjects!
Courtiers!
Today, I, Shantanu
announce my son, Devarath
as the prince of Hastinapur!
Hail the Prince!
- Hail him!
King, isn't a queen someone
whose son is entitled
to the throne?
Others are considered
as mere maids.
Here, I am the daughter
of the king of fishermen.
At Hastinapur, I will be a
stepmother to the king.
But I would stay at Hastinapur
only as the Queen.
Father.
If a son cannot perceive the
sorrow on his father's face
then he ought to be blind.
What is the cause
of your anguish?
After all...
Father, what is the sorrow that
your son cannot do away with?
Everyone says that
Devarath is very powerful.
But I have surrendered
before your grief.
Everyone says that Devarath
is very knowledgeable.
But, I am unable to find a way
to make my father happy.
Then...
Of what use is then the
power and the knowledge?
Father
until I do not find a
way to make you happy
I would abstain
from food.
No, son.
You shouldn't take such an oath.
Son, my heart is the
reason of my agony.
Your son can fulfil all your
wishes, father.
You should tell me
the worries that have
you so bogged down.
I will free you of
all the worries.
Son, I do not wish
to get rid of this agony.
I just want to learn to
live with this agony.
No, father.
My father be fraught
with worries all his life
is something completely
unacceptable to me.
I will surely find the reason
of your grief
and also find a solution
for the same.
Devarath!
Son...
Where can I find lady Satyavati?
Greetings, lady.
Why have you come here?
I have come to you for alms.
My father's happiness as alms.
My father loves you immensely.
He is unhappy and bereaved
by staying away from you.
Seeing your father unhappy
you shouldn't be unjust
to me, Prince.
I too am unhappy by staying
away from him.
If the separation is
bothering both of you
then what is the cause
for the separation?
If I marry your father
after smothering my desires
then my heart will
grieve forever.
I will never be at peace.
The one who isn't at peace
can never make others happy.
The shadow of a burning tree
does fall on the earth.
But no one can sit
under the shade that is cast.
What does Hastinapur lack
that would cause you unrest?
My happiness comes with respect.
How would I be
respected there?
What place would I be
given at Hastinapur?
What will be my position?
You will be the
Queen of Hastinapur.
You will be the Royal Mother.
Prince, a Royal Mother is
the mother of a prince.
I would accept you as my mother.
I'll honour you and bestow upon
you the rights of a mother.
The one you accept
isn't the truth
but a feeling.
Just like a shadow.
And a shadow
is always on the opposite
side of the light, Prince.
No, Prince.
I would become unfortunate
if I marry your father.
The ones who are looked at
by King Shantanu
become fortunate.
How can you be unfortunate
by attaining the king's love?
No, that will not happen.
It would, Prince.
Not only I
but my children would be
unfortunate also.
Your son will become
the king after you.
What would be the future
of my children?
They wouldn't even posses
the fishing skills.
They have to accept a
lowly position in the army
and be satisfied.
For you and the sake of your son
they would be destined to die
in the war and nothing else.
Are you trying to say, I am the
reason of my father's agony?
For 25 years
I have dreamed about my
father's love for me.
I have yearned for his
love and blessings.
And you...
Are you saying that
I am a misfortune to him?
No, Prince.
You are his fortune.
But, King Shantanu
can get only one
among two joys.
Either to stay with his
son at the palace
or to live with his wife
in this humble home.
Both of the joys together
are impossible for him.
No, lady-
My father will have
both the joys
and together.
The way
this court has been
drowned in darkness
similarly,
King Dhritarashtra
we will fill
your life with darkness!
We will fill it with darkness!
What kind of nefariousness
is this, Duryodhan?!
Brother Yudhishthir,
just give us the order.
Let us resort to arms,
brother Yudhishthir!
Duryodhan!
I will annihilate
every bit of this palace!
Brother Yudhishthir,
either kill all of us
or give us the order
to kill this Duryodhan!
Duryodhan!
The court of Hastinapur
has never witnessed
such misbehaviour!
Think of the propriety
of the Kuru dynasty
just this once.
Just this once...
King Dhritarashtra!
Open the eyes of your heart!
Do not allow unrighteousness
of this gravity in your court.
Crown Prince Duryodhan!
No such thing can happen
in the court of the Kurus!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!
Be quiet!
Quiet!
Ask Yudhishthir!
Can a master not punish
his servants and maids?!
Are you, your brothers
and Draupadi
not my servants and maid?!
Answer me,
Yudhishthir!
We are.
We are your servants and maid
but what kind
of a punishment is this?
I am not a maid!
A kingdom is conquered
with might, Duryodhan!
Not with treachery!
Look at that,
grandsire!
Just look at the behaviour
of that maid!
Is punishing her
not the correct thing to do?!
It is incorrect!
Enough of this,
Duryodhan!
Enough of this!
This is reprehensible!
And upon seeing such
reprehensible behaviour
I cannot stay in this court
even a moment longer!
Stop, Your Excellency Bhishma!
Uncle, you had promised me
that my sons and I
will never be abandoned by you.
I, the son of Ganga
swear on the purity
of my mother
that I will not be
the King of Hastinapur
but spend my entire life
as its servant!
Until you are
the King of Hastinapur
I shall serve you and
Hastinapur as its servant
and deem every word
of yours an order.
Be seated now
Your Excellency.
Say it,
grandsire.
Dear Draupadi
it has been proved
that you...
You are
a maid.
Crown Prince Duryodhan
the correct mode of punishing
servants and maids
has been specified
in our judicial system.
But a maid
being stripped of her clothes
is not something that is
present in any judicial system.
What's the punishment for taking
to arms in the court, Minister?
In the court of Indraprastha
were we punished according
to the judicial system?
No, Minister.
Only to insult us warriors
our weapons
were snatched from us.
Even you were present there.
Why were you quiet then?!
Warrior?
Had you been a warrior
you would have been
in a battlefield.
You would not have been
a part of this treachery.
There are many monkeys who have
long hair on their heads
but no one calls them
a lion because of it!
Draupadi!
Do not argue,
King of Anga.
Do not argue.
Duryodhan
this court cannot allow a woman
to get insulted in this manner.
My darling
give up the idea
of disrobing Draupadi.
Uncle!
I am correct,
my darling.
The environment of the court
is not favourable.
The correct thing to do would be
to utilize this time
effectively.
The great guru Drona
and His Excellency Bhishma
are 'Maharathis
and you must
bring them to your side
so that in the future
they draw their weapons
only at your command.
Alright.
Alright.
If everyone present in the court
gives up their weapons to me
and pleads with me
only then will I think
of letting maid Draupadi
go off the hook.
Plead with me,
guru Drona!
Your Excellency Bhishma
Minister
plead with me!
And you...
You five servants
must also plead with me!
All of you must plead with me!
Duryodhan
all of us will give up
our weapons
but all of us
plead with you
to pardon
Draupadi now.
Grandsire
I had promised to think about it
and I have made up my mind.
Maid Draupadi
cannot be pardoned by me.
I cannot!
Dusshasan!
Dusshasan,
go on
and strip maid Draupadi
of her clothes!
Stop, brother Dusshasan.
Brother Duryodhan,
listen to me.
Without the knowledge
of right and wrong
no person can ever become King
but you are the Emperor now!
If you let
such injustice prevail
the subjects of the Aryan region
will revolt against you.
Vikarna, whose side are you on?
Have you forgotten your father
and deemed Pandu
to be your father now?!
Brother Dusshasan, giving sound
advice to one's elder brother
does not imply
revolting against him.
Brother Duryodhan,
when a King loses in a battle
he is bound to give up
his weapons
but no woman should be
disrobed in this manner!
A warrior being
robbed of his weapons
and a woman being disrobed
are two different things.
The daughter of Drupad
is the honour
of the Kuru dynasty
and that is the truth.
Honour of the dynasty!
What are you saying,
Vikarna?
If having long hair on his head
does not make a monkey a lion
then wearing a married
woman's head ornament
does not make a woman pure.
The fruits of the Cannabis plant
are fruits as well, Vikarna
but they are not
at par with mangoes.
How can you call such a woman
to be honourable?
A woman
who has relationships
with five men!
Such women are harlots!
Whether such women
are clothed are not
makes absolutely no difference!
Dusshasan
strip that maid of her clothes!
Duryodhan
please do not commit
such a misdeed!
Stop, Dusshasan!
Be quiet!
Be quiet,
guru Drona.
Please be quiet,
His Excellency.
And you as well
sons of Pandu.
You should also be quiet now.
Protecting me
is out of your league now.
The courage to stop
this unrighteousness
in the name of righteousness
resides with none of you!
What good is righteousness
if it turns one's strength
into one's weakness?
What good is the truth
if it does not incinerate
the deeds of wicked people
but the courage
of the person speaking it?
What good is the truth
if it does not incinerate
the deeds of wicked people
but the courage
of the person speaking it?
None of you have understood
the true form of righteousness.
An earthen lamp
does provide luminance
but when the flame gets
extinguished, the same lamp
blackens the hands as well!
And the righteousness
residing within all of you
has lost its luminance now.
That is why,
protecting me
is out of your league now.
If I am
to be protected now
then the Almighty himself
will do so.
Come, Dusshasan.
Come and test your might.
Govind.
Let me take your leave,
Highness.
Wait, Shakuni.
Wait!
Actually I'd need you
to give the right advise
to Duryodhan
at the right time, Shakuni.
I hereby revoke my order
for asking you to leave
Gandhar right now. Shakuni!
I'd send my confidante,
Sanjay with a peace treaty
to Pandavas.
- No, Highness.
No.
In fact Pandavas need to propose
the peace treaty.
That will make Duryodhan happy.
Hastinapur's throne
and you shall redeem
your lost respect.
I hope you don't have a problem
with this proposal.
- I don't.
I am for peace.
No matter which way
it comes from.
Perfect!
Absolutely perfect!
Then
their uncle
that is the Chief Minister,
Vidhur too could aptly
escort Sanjay.
He shall talk to Pandavas
about compassion.
Sanjay on the other hand
would talk to them
about politics.
Then
Vasudev Krishna shall be invited
to Hastinapur
with Pandava's proposal.
Greetings!
I greet the warrior
a thousand times.
He feeds me.
Thanks to him, there's
abundance everywhere.
I greet the Pandavas
a thousand times.
He's mighty, magnanimous...
I greet you a thousand times.
A warfare wizard.
I greet all you citizens.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Tomorrow Princess Uttara shall
Arjun's son Abhimanyu.
It will be all happy
an festive.
Singing and dancing.
A lavish feast shall
be organised.
There'll be charity.
How about we welcome
these happy times
with the tale
of an ideal personality?
On this evening,
prior to the wedding
in order to entertain you all
I've been invited to recite
one such tale.
So, people, which tale would
you like to listen to?
Shiva's wedding!
- Ram's wedding.
Parashuram's tale.
- 'Calm down!
Why are you screaming?
Tell me, Yudhishtir. Which tale
would you like to listen to?
Not me.
Today Vasudev himself is here.
Vasudev, which tale would
you like to listen to?
This lady here
would decide that.
Tell me. Which tale would
help you calm down?
I am fine now, Govind.
- No.
You seem fine but you
aren't at peace.
Brother, may I suggest?
Go aboard.
Dhundhumali
I would like to listen
to a tale
that I've heard
during childhood.
I haven't been
able to understand
it's importance until now.
Neither has my son, Abhmanyu's
been able to understand this
nor my sister's sons.
Yes, people!
There's just one such tale
that I can think of.
People close to him
have never understood
his importance
and his sensibilities.
But an ordinary man like me
has not just observed him
but understood him as well.
No matter how much
I praise him
I never think it's enough.
The entire Aryan clan
is indebted to him.
He has helped
people get rid of agony.
He looks like a common man
but he's an ascetic.
He looks like a King
but he's a hermit.
He looks like a warrior
but is magnanimous.
He's knowledgeable,
a philosopher and generous
yet he is not proud!
People, there's just one
such man
It isn't a story of Lord Shiva
or Rama.
It's a tale of Lord Krishna.
It's not a warrior tale
of Kailash.
Not a tale of land of gold.
A tale about the banks
of the River Yamuna.
A tale about the village
Gokul.
Ugrasena, the King of Mathura* was held captive
*Now a city in the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
by his own son, Kans
and he took over his throne.
Kans was the son-in-law of
Magadh King Jarasandha.
He possessed a dark demeanour.
Stop!
He was monstrous,
loathsome and sinful.
He gave Yadavas a tough time.
He troubled his subjects.
He had surpassed
all the limits.
Be it the art deceit,
treachery or betrayal!
He had mastered it all.
You can't cross Mathura gate.
What's the trouble,
brother Kans?
The trouble is Devki.
The lady you're married
to, Vasudev.
Haven't you heard the prophecy
that Devki's eighth son shall
be responsible for my death?
And I shall kill Devki.
Comrade, pull Devki
down the chariot.
Wait.
Kans,
will you kill Devki
for a prophecy?
Vasudev!
Divine prophecies
never go wrong.
Prophecies are God sent
and they always come true.
That's a myth.
How can my son kill his uncle?
It's a myth.
I know everything, Devki.
Devak*, Sakroor...
*Devaka was Devaki's father, the younger brother of King Ugrasena of Mathura.
the old Somdutt...
They're all eager to see me die.
Before accusing us
take a good look
at yourself first.
Yadavas aren't your enemy.
You torment your clan
all the time.
You harass your subjects.
You've held your
own father captive.
An arrogant man
is hated by everyone.
Kans, you'll suffer for sure.
I!
I'll suffer!
I'll suffer!
I'll suffer.
Who'll make me suffer?
Who?
Him!
Him!
Or him!
Remember this!
I am your God.
If anyone goes against me
he shall be beheaded.
Kans, don't be foolish.
Don't forget who I am.
I am Shurasena's son
from Yadava clan.
My sister Briha
is King Kuntibhoj's
adopted daughter.
She's been married to
Hastinapur's ruler, Pandu.
If you harm me
then Pandu, King Shurasena
and Kuntibhoj's army
shall attack you.
You may die today.
Send for everyone.
I'll be killed
by Devki's eighth son
as per the divine prophecy.
No one else
can cause me any harm.
You can't harm me too.
No one can harm me.
Do you see my soldiers?
They can kill all
the Yadava men right here.
No brother.
Listen to me. It's a myth.
Brother, listen to me.
You'll not be harmed.
Brother, trust me.
Brother!
- Kans, wait!
If the prophecy's right
how will you stop it.
If it's true
what will killing
Devki fetch you.
I am Shurasena's son Vasudev.
If I want I can
kill you right away.
That would bring a stir
among Yadavas.
It won't do good to anyone.
Devki and me are ready
to sacrifice our lives.
We surrender, Kansa.
I promise, Kans
that neither Hastinapur,
nor Kuntibhoj
will make an effort
to rescue us.
I pardon you
and Devki.
My soldiers, arrive now
and put them behind the bars.
Vasudev!
Vasudev!
Here's the infant.
It's time to sacrifice
your child, Devki.
If marrying Karna
is not what Draupadi wants
then she can
certainly say no to it.
The Crown Prince
of Hastinapur, Duryodhan
is making his entrance
for the competition!
Greetings, King Drupad.
To take part in this competition
instead of me,
I call upon my friend
the King of Anga, Karna
who has dedicated his competence
to our friendship.
This way, King Karna of Anga.
Where are you, Prince Arjun?
Where are you headed,
Brahmins'?
Greetings, revered one.
Greetings.
All of us are on our way
to seek alms.
To seek alms here?
Kampilya is like Lord Kuber's* treasury at the moment
*The Lord of Wealth.
and you have come here
to seek alms?
It is just like,
despite having a river nearby
a rodent is licking
the dry earth.
We do not wish to go
to Kampilya, revered one.
We need to proceed towards
Naimisharanya shortly.
If you can offer us some alms
we would be grateful
to you, revered one.
What can I give you?
I am sitting here with the hope
of reaching Kampilya myself.
But I am a cripple.
If I could walk then I would
have certainly gone there.
One would get to have
novel dishes there
and would get gold coins.
And I suggest that you
should go there as well
and take me there
on your shoulders.
Pardon us, revered one
but we do not wish to go there.
Listen
you need not worry
about how I return.
I shall arrange for it.
But just take me there.
I would be grateful for it.
Why would all of you serve me
when my own sons
have forsaken me?
A cripple has no one
in this world.
No one...
This way.
Pardon us, King of Anga!
But you cannot be allowed
to do that.
The person who marries my sister
will have to demonstrate
his competence himself.
But this is not a fair
competition, Prince.
Competence cannot be judged
solely by one's archery skills.
Crown Prince Duryodhan
is a competent warrior.
When it comes to
fighting with a mace
he is superior than all
the Princes present here.
Had this competition
involved fighting with a mace
Crown Prince Duryodhan
would certainly
have emerged
as the superior one.
But to have my sister married
to the most superior
archer of the world
is our decision.
Nevertheless
on behalf of Crown
Prince Duryodhan
I have the right to take part
in this competition.
The competence of
a King's trusted soldier
is deemed that of the King.
And I
have dedicated myself
to Crown Prince Duryodhan.
That is why,
when I achieve the goal
my victory will be deemed
that of Crown Prince Duryodhan.
This is the prevalent tradition
of the Aryan region.
This may be a tradition
of Hastinapur, King of Anga
but not of Panchal!
I do not give you
the permission.
Please go back to your place.
This time,
you have been defeated
in the name of tradition,
my dear.
What will you do now?
In the name of tradition,
you have insulted
the competence of a person,
King Drupad!
I, the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur
ask you
what you intend to do.
If you wanted to insult
so many King and Princes
then for the Ashvamedha 'Yajna,'* you could have let the horses
*Releasing a horse to roam for a year, and if it wanders into neighbouring provinces hostile to the sacrificer, they must be subjugated.
run freely in the
entire Aryan region!
That way, your competence would
have been proved before all.
Your Highness.
Crown Prince Duryodhan
to worry for
his daughter's future
is not only
the right of a father
but also his responsibility.
That is why, a 'swayamvar
is deemed a noble deed.
And to deem the defeat
in a 'swayamvar' an insult
is not correct.
King Karna of Anga
has no fear of defeat.
Snatching the right to
take part in the competition
is what I deem an insult,
Vasudev Krishna.
A tree can be nourished
only by water.
Milk cannot do what water can.
Similarly
the proof of your competence
cannot be given
by another person, Prince.
But my friend certainly can
prove his competence.
Friend Karna
pick up that bow
and achieve the goal.
Friend Karna pick
up that bow
and achieve the goal.
That is a splendid decision,
my dear!
A splendid decision!
Listen, King Drupad.
My friend is the King of Anga.
He has every right to take part
in this competition.
He shall marry your daughter.
Draupadi
King Karna of Anga
may win the competition.
In the entire Aryan region,
this competition can be won
by two people, Your Highness.
The son of Pandu, Arjun
and
the King of Anga, Karna.
If marrying Karna
is not what Draupadi wants
then she can certainly
say no to it.
Stop!
I will not marry the
son of a charioteer.
Soldiers!
Take the cavalry and fortify
the entrance gates.
Archers, assume
your posts at the
top of the gates
with fire arrows.
All infantry units, keep vigil
within the fort.
And the cavalry, outside
the fort, behind the hillock.
Close the fort's gate.
What is the news, Madan?
- It's a vast army, commander.
It flows like the tides
of the river Sindhu.
Infantry, cavalry and chariots
are endless in numbers.
Their heavy marching is
kicking up the dirt, sky high.
They have rations and water for
the soldiers too, your majesty.
They seem to have prepared
for a lengthy conquest.
Whose army is it, soldier?
I couldn't see their banner,
your majesty.
But I could see the chariot
at their forefront.
It's a chariot of white horses
like that of the
Sun-God himself.
There's a white flag on the
chariot too, your majesty.
And on the flag is a golden
emblem of a Banyan tree.
That great man resembled
the blazing Sun-God himself.
He had an ornate armour
upon his body.
His arms are like
pillars of iron.
Eyes, intense as two fireballs.
And the seal of the moon
adorns his forehead.
Your highness, this warrior is
none else but the very son
of the great King Shantanu
and mother Ganga.
Bheeshma.
Mother, what is happening
around here?
Did you not hear?
Hastinapur has attacked.
What shall happen now,
mother?
Gandhar's army stands no chance
before Hastinapur's forces.
Streams of blood shall flow.
Within a matter of days
the fort of Gandhar shall
be reduced to rubble.
Accepting defeat even before
the battle isn't wise, Aarshi.
I beg your pardon,
your highness.
But Gandhar hasn't waged war
since many years.
So you aren't aware.
Demolishing defeated cities,
burning the homeless.
Killing the innocent and
violating the honor of women.
All these are unavoidable
in a war, Gandhari.
What shall we do now,
sister-in-law?
What all the other women
do during battle.
Wait here for our
ultimate doom.
And then..
Sister-in-law.
Pick up a weapon.
I shall participate in the
battle alongside father.
Gandhari!
- Yes, mother.
This war terrifies me
as much as darkness does.
Sister-in-law, the great
teacher had taught us
that there is just one way
to overcome your fears.
Embrace that fear.
If death is inevitable
then I shall die
in the battlefield.
Fear always roots itself
within the human heart.
Sometimes, the fear
of losing wealth.
Sometimes, the fear
of humiliation.
Sometimes, the fear of being
separated from your loved ones.
Hence
presence of fear
seems normal to all.
Have you ever thought?
Is it that the situation
or the object that causes fear
is also the origin
of grief?
No.
There is no rule as such.
And everyone's experience
in fact tells
that being scared does not
solve problems in the future.
Fear is only the imagination
of the grief to come.
It has no relationship
with reality whatsoever.
Despite knowing that
fear is nothing but imagination
is it difficult to be free from
it and live fearlessly?
Think about it.
What are the orders,
your majesty?
It is time to respond to
the siege, your majesty.
The white banner of surrender
or the red banner of war!
Humiliation or death..
Never did these two colours
seem so dark, Shatasva.
But, your majesty.
We have to wave
one of these two banners.
The army has stopped
marching, your majesty.
Surprising indeed.
They're waving the yellow banner
of friendship, your majesty.
Open the gates of the fort.
If he wanted a dialogue,
why did he bring his army along?
Must be, to flaunt his power
before us.
But why?
Gandhar has done nothing
to cause insult to Hastinapur.
Hastinapur's throne has been
vacant for so long now.
After the death of
Emperor Vichitravirya
the kingdom has no king
for the past 25 years.
Yet, we never tried to
attack them.
We never allied with
any of their enemies.
Then, what was the need to
flaunt power before an ally?
Your majesty, Power is flaunted
before an ally
when one has some
demands to make.
What could a veteran such as
Bheeshma want from me?
A king should join hands
only before the Gods.
To embrace his allies and
to punish his foes
is what truly befits him,
king Subal.
Your heroic deeds aren't lesser
than that of a God,
Son of Ganges.
But I'm not a king. l'm just
a royal servant of Hastinapur.
My status isn't higher
than yours, your majesty.
Although you may
not be a king
your calibre is greater than
any emperor, son of Ganges.
Calibre comes into picture
only during a siege.
And I'm here,
to visit my friend's home.
To strengthen our friendship.
And to play host
to a friend like you
is the good fortune of
Gandhar, son of Ganges.
All hail Bheeshma,
the son of Ganges.
All hail Bheeshma,
the son of Ganges.
All hail Bheeshma,
the son of Ganges.
Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law, Bheeshma
has arrived only to befriend us.
I heard so, princess.
A great calamity in Gandhar
has been averted.
What is your opinion,
sister-in-law?
Could he be masking
his intentions of war
behind the facade
of an alliance?
I've heard that Bheeshma
never lies, princess.
I've heard there is none
more powerful than him
among the Aryas.
Yes, Sugdha.
Even Parshuram
couldn't defeat him.
A powerful man is always calm
and composed.
Let's see for ourselves.
It shall be proved whether he is
truly powerful
or is it all just tall tales.
- I can't help but wonder
what the powerful Bheeshma could
possibly demand from Gandhar.
Retire.
Looking at such a grand welcome
and vast affection
my heart is truly
overwhelmed.
I hope you have imbued
the same elegance and discipline
into your daughter
and daughter-in law too
Son of ganges, What could our
miniscule Gandhar offer
to the glorious and powerful
Kuru empire?
A future.
And the prospect of
happiness in that future.
Your majesty, you are aware that
no king has attacked you so far.
Because you have the protection
of the Kuru empire.
If the subjects of the
Kuru empire and Gandhar unite
then both the kingdoms shall
become incredibly powerful.
Think about it,
your majesty.
An alliance is formed between
two equally powerful kings.
Gandhar is a mere servant
to Hastinapur, son of Ganges.
Your majesty. Hence, l put forth
not an alliance, but a proposal.
A wedding proposal.
The whole Arya clan talks highly
of the beauty and virtues
of your daughter,
princess Gandhari.
I put forth a wedding proposal
for princess Gandhari.
Do not disappoint me.
But haven't you sworn yourself
to celibacy, son of ganges?
Princess Gandhari's proposal
is for a Kuru prince.
Not myself.
I consider Gandhari to
be my daughter.
I am in agreement
to this.
Who can be a better groom
than prince Pandu?
Prince Pandu's competence
and prowess are known to all.
Dhritarashtra.
Prince Dhritarashtra.
From where did prince Pandu
crop into the picture?
He is the younger son.
Prince Dhritarashtra
is the elder son.
Your majesty.
I am talking about
Prince Dhritarashtra.
Think it over, your majesty.
A hundred sons can be borne
even by a sculptor's wife.
They may build
a colossal house too.
But, not an entire kingdom.
The number of offsprings
is not important.
What matters
is the clan whose virtues and
upbringing they imbibe within.
Not every woman has the
good fortune to
bear a hundred sons
of the Kuru dynasty.
Oh, great one.
Gandhari is the most beautiful
princess in the world.
She is well versed
in many disciplines
and well trained
in combat too.
But prince Dhritarashtra
you know about him.
Prince Dhritarashtra
is capable in every aspect.
And there's no denying it.
You are not aware of
Dhritarashtra's brilliance
Queen Sudarbha.
Dhritarashtra's arms are so
powerful that with a single blow
he can knock down
many elephants at once.
Being crowned as Dhritarashtra's
queen, princess Gandhari
shall be the most fortunate
woman of the Arya race.
Where are you off to, princess?
It isn't the time
to leave us all, yet.
Let her go, Sugdha.
lt's expected of her
to be arrogant now.
There's a proposal for her from
such a huge kingdom, after all.
It's not so, sister-in-law.
Even if it's so, it's
understandable Gandhari.
There's no kingdom
in the entire world
that's more powerful
and wealthy than Hastinapur.
I too have heard great tales
about Hastinapur, princess.
I keep trying to imagine
how would Hastinapur be.
Hastinapur.
Tying this bond with Hastinapur,
you shall turn from king Subal
to emperor Subal.
That means, flaunting your power
you are here for a gain.
Isn't it, o great Bheeshma?
I'm here to induct the royal
family of Gandhar
into our family,
queen Sudarbha.
And within a family,
there is no question of gain.
There's only co-operation.
Gandhar cannot help Hastinapur
profit in any way.
Instead, Gandhar can only gain
from Hastinapur.
It may be a great kingdom
for all I know.
Even our Gandhar isn't
so weak either.
Anyway, a marriage takes place
with a prince, not the kingdom.
Oh!
So our princess is already
dreaming of her husband.
Sister-in-law.
In my opinion, the marriage
of princess Gandhari
and Prince Dhritarashtra is
ordained by the Gods.
Resolutions and options are
games a mind plays, king Subal.
But, I do not mean to
pressurize you in any way.
Only after clearing all your
doubts should you
arrive at a decision,
your majesty.
So, what have you decided,
your majesty?
The prince of Hastinapur seems
like Lord lndra among humans.
The subjects of the Kuru empire
consider their princes as Gods
and worship them
with all their heart.
Sister-in-law,
what is his name?
Why do you want to know
his name, princess?
Anyway, a wife never utters
her husband's name.
Sister-in-law, please tell me.
What is his name?
His name is Dhritarashtra.
Prince Dhritarashtra.
So, Your Highness
which of your brothers
are you going to put at stake?
Impossible!
Prince Duryodhan,
in the game of dice
you can only wager property.
You cannot put humans at stake.
But this game
is not for property,
Prime Minister.
He has himself said
that humans play
for their pride.
And one always puts
his pride at stake
when playing-
Humans are proud of
many things, prince.
Knowledge acquired.
A father's dutifulness.
Mother's purity.
And one's lineage.
But these cannot be
put at stake.
Because humans have no
right over it, grandsire.
Father, mother, teacher and heir
are all God's blessings,
grandsire.
Anything that you have
a right on and you are proud of
can be put at stake
you have said it, grandsire.
This is a pointless
discussion, Duryodhan.
Parents have rights
on their children
but I haven't heard of anyone
having a right on his siblings.
Prime Minister Vidur
you had acceded to
King Pandu's authority
and you also accept
King Dhritarashtra's authority.
Don't you?
Excellent.
Absolutely excellent.
So it's clear
that my dear Duryodhan
has the right on his
younger brother Vikarna
and he is also proud of
him, Your Highness.
So, Prince Duryodhan,
can put his brother Vikarna
at stake.
If His Highness deems it fit
he can abide by the rules.
So tell me,
Your Highness
which of your brothers
will you put at stake?
He will put me at stake.
No, Nakul.
No...
- Nakul
not you.
No, Nakul.
Long live the Empress.
What happened?
Hastinapur's Prince has put
his younger brother Vikarna
at stake.
And Prince Nakul has volunteered
from the emperor's side.
What kind of a game is this?
Are humans and relationships
meant to be put at stake?
Demons and serpents perform
the 'Narmedh Yajna
where humans are sacrificed.
Is Hastinapur too inculcating
this tradition, Your Highness?
Had Krishna been here
he would have definitely stopped
this game of dice.
But King Shaka has
attacked Dwarka.
Krishna is fighting a battle
to protect Dwarka.
Queen Gandhari...
Queen Gandhari
we have to stop this game,
immediately.
Kunti
when grandsire and Vidur
are unable to stop it
then there must be
an ethical dilemma involved.
How will I be able
to resolve this?
I will resolve this.
Maid
go tell the Emperor
that the five petals of hibiscus
are connected to its stem
not to each other.
He doesn't have the right
to put my husband at stake.
Go right away and tell him.
- As you command, Your Highness.
No, Nakul.
I cannot put you at stake.
Brother, it will be appropriate
for you to put me at stake.
If you lose,
then Arjun's competency
and the strength of
brother Bheem will be with you.
Brother Bheem and brother Arjun
will be able to get me released
but I won't be able
to get them released.
If you are in a dilemma then put
brother Bheem at stake, Emperor!
If you are defeated
then serving me as a slave
will be quite easy for him.
Nakul may die
toiling as a slave.
Pick up your weapon, Dushasana!
Let's decide right away
as to who will die!
Dear Bheem!
This is the game of dice,
not a battlefield.
Challenging a kingdom that has
surrendered to you, for war
is unrighteousness, son.
Calm down.
Calm down, Bheem.
I will put my...
I'll put my younger brother
Nakul... - Greetings, Emperor!
I have a message
from the Empress.
I can't put my younger
brother Nakul at stake.
I am definitely proud of him
but I have no rights over him.
I don't have any rights over
any of my brothers!
We brothers are interconnected
like the petals of hibiscus
but through the medium
of our wife Draupadi.
She has the right over us.
That's why...
This game is over now.
Emperor...
I have a question.
Will you please answer?
Does a branch grow on the
tree, first
or a flower petal?
Emperor...
Empress came much
later into your life.
All five of you
got married to her.
Were you not brothers
before that?
Didn't you share
any relationship?
Prince Nakul, answer me.
Didn't the Emperor
have any rights on you
before marriage?
After getting married
did you give that right
to your wife?
Didn't the Emperor
have any rights on you
before marriage?
After getting married
did you give that right
to your wife?
It means
if the Emperor, upon
seeing a hibiscus flower
quits the game
then it will be violation
of the rules.
And unrighteousness, as well.
I put my younger brother Nakul
at stake.
Emperor, if you get six points
then you shall
win over Duryodhan.
Emperor, Duryodhan's
first pawn has won.
You just need
four points to reach the fort.
Emperor, it is unfortunate.
You just needed four points
but you got five points.
You got one extra point.
Now if Duryodhan's pawn
beats yours
then he will win the bet.
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven.
In order to beat Emperor's pawn
I just need seven points.
Then, Nakul will be my slave.
Come on.
Emperor, rejoice.
You lost your younger brother
Nakul.
The place of a slave
and the footwear
lies at the master's feet.
Nakul
come here.
Come and kneel among
these slaves.
Come here!
My brother is as pious
as Lord Ram's impressions.
I will make sure he dominates
you, brother Duryodhan!
The kind of behaviour I dispense
to my slaves, is none of
Prince Arjun's concern, Emperor!
It is only mine.
Calm down, Arjun.
Calm down.
Slave Nakul, come here!
Come and sit among these slaves.
Come!
Sit down, slave Nakul.
When one's pride
is wounded
it reflects on the face first.
Show me
this imperious woman's face.
Your Highness
what kind of practice
is being conducted
at Hastinapur's
royal court?
I am the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru lineage.
I am the prestige
of the Kuru dynasty.
I had entered this city
as the pride of Hastinapur
Your Highness.
And I am being brought here
like some animal!
Why!
Grandsire
you're the most glorious one
in the whole of this kingdom.
You're Lady Ganga's son.
How can you remain silent
on seeing this kind of behaviour
being conducted
right in front of your eyes?
Guru Drona
you're a father figure to me.
Why am I being
treated like this?
Your Highness
your sons are defiling
and this is bringing
dishonour to you!
Why don't you stop them?
A maid
has to carry out
her master's orders.
Maid?
Am I a maid?
What makes me a maid?
My question has still not
been answered by Yudhisthira.
By losing himself in the game
he had lost his rights
on me.
Then how could he put
me at stake?
I question everyone
at this court...
What kind of
righteousness is this?
Why are you questioning
the court?
Ask your husband!
Slave Yudhisthira
answer her.
Answer me.
The rights with which
you put your brothers at stake
did you exercise the same rights
to put me at stake?
Yes, Draupadi.
Family members have a right
on each other.
A wife is not
a mere family member!
Wife is the better half.
On a man's death
his family definitely
feels sad.
But it's only his wife
who becomes a widow.
Do pearls kept in a bowl
share the same relationship
as two pearls woven together
in an ornament?
Then how could you exercise
such rights on me
that you have
on your brothers?
Answer!
Don't be silent!
Minister Vidura
your kingdom is ruled
by justice.
You answer me.
Does your kingdom
give one's brothers
the right on his property?
If the person gives the right
to his brothers...
Then, yes.
Then the right
of the brother
is accepted.
It's the society that gives
a wife the right
on her husband's property.
The kingdom's law
gives her that right.
She receives those rights
as soon as she's married.
So, tell me, Minister.
When Yudhisthira
put his property at stake
I too had a right on it.
Then, why didn't he take
my permission?
Answer me!
- Maid Draupadi
when all of you came to
Hastinapur to play this game
had you bound your five husbands
with any kind of restrictions?
No?
Then you have yourself
given your husbands the right
to lose all the property.
Now, stop rambling
for no reason.
This means
since I didn't bind my husbands
with any restrictions
it was my fault?
I trusted my husbands.
Was that a crime?
Answer me, Pandavas!
All of you have to answer
to all my questions
in this court
of unrighteousness.
Arjun
You answer me.
Had Yudhisthira taken
your permission
before losing me
in this gamble?
Did all of you
give the permission?
Have all of you together
made me a maid from an empress?
Answer!
You had taken the seven vows
of marriage from me
and in return
you had vowed
to protect me.
Did you forget all about that,
Pandavas?
For the sake
of your family's happiness...
So that four of you don't
have to lead an ascetic life
I have converted
my whole life into a penance.
And in return
why am I receiving
such a disgusting reward?
Why?
Forgive us, Draupadi.
Forgive us.
We
never go against our
elder brother's orders.
And brother Yudhisthira had to
give in to Duryodhan's orders.
Forgive us.
This means
you were being righteous.
Yudhisthira
was not unrighteous either.
Every person present
in this court
has abided by
righteousness.
So does righteousness means
dishonouring a woman?
Does righteousness give you men
the right to exploit a woman?
What was my fault
that I was brought here
in this manner?
Everybody did think about
being righteous in their own way
but no one thought
about my honour
My right
and my emotions.
No, they didn't
because your husbands
are not man enough.
Why are you relying
on such righteousness,
maid Draupadi
which makes these warriors
incompetent?
Come
and establish a relationship
with me.
Come
and establish a relationship
with me.
It will give me happiness
and you...
Protection.
Come, maid Draupadi
be seated on my lap.
Come on!
Duryodhan
I will give you a death,
looking at which
the whole of earth
will tremble.
I will break your thighs
and take your life!
It's a promise!
It's a promise.
It's my promise!
And until I don't
destroy all of you
I will add mud
to the food I have.
So that it keeps reminding me
that I'm not a human
but an earthworm.
An earthworm!
Don't ramble.
Come, maid Draupadi
and obey the orders
of your master.
Foolish Duryodhan!
I have taken birth from
the holy fire of Yajna.
And fire can
never be bound by anything.
You cannot make
me your slave
because that is not
acceptable to me.
I detest it!
Your Highness
in your court, a maid
is leaving
by dishonouring
her master's orders.
Wait, Draupadi!
Obey your master's orders.
Let her go, Your Highness.
Let her go.
For the sake of peace
we have tolerated
many an injustice.
Ignore this one too,
Your Highness.
Let her go.
Your Highness
a soldier who dares to stop
the wind forgets
that if the wind
forgot its limits
then the weapons
will be compelled to break.
It was decided to keep
unrighteousness in its limits.
Now, don't let unrighteousness
gain prominence.
Has it not been proved
in this court
that now, only Duryodhan
has the rights on Draupadi?
It was, Your Highness, but...
- There's no question
of an argument, Prime Minister.
If I give credibility to a
maid dishonouring her master
then all the maids and slaves
of this kingdom
will begin to insult
their masters.
On the mere basis
of a washer man's allegations
Lord Ram had asked Lady Sita
to take up an ordeal.
While here, there are many maids
and slaves who will protest.
It will upset the administration
of Hastinapur, Minister.
No.
Maid Draupadi will have
to obey
all of Duryodhan's orders.
Maid Draupadi will have
to obey
all of Duryodhan's
orders.
Maid
I order you
to come back.
Independence lies
within oneself, Duryodhan.
It's not a piece of clothing
that one can snatch.
You're so arrogant,
maid Draupadi
that you won't obey
your master's orders!
Independence cannot
be snatched
but clothes can certainly be.
Dushasana
The way she had us disarmed
at the court in Indrapastha
in front of the entire
Aryan lineage...
In the same manner
in this court
disrobe her!
Duryodhan!
Stay in your limits!
The way
this court has immersed
in darkness
similarly
Emperor Dhritarashtra
we will fill your life
with darkness!
We will fill it
with darkness!
Just like how the dark clouds
pour forth the rains
and cleanse themselves.
Just like how the water in the
rivers cleanses itself
by leaving the dirt aside
as it flows.
In the same manner,
it is the duty of the king
to punish himself in order to
purify himself.
How can I get rid of
my responsibilities?
Atonement
is greater than justice
and punishment, Pandu.
True atonement is one
in which
anything else in life
seems trivial in front of it.
I understand
but I become frail thinking
of Hastinapur's future.
Will this throne be
vacant again?
Even while shouldering the
responsibilities of the kingdom
you can live the life
of an ascetic.
No, grandsire.
If one builds his house
on a slope
he is bound to fall
into the ditch.
If I live amidst this leisure
sooner or later I will forget
about my atonement
and get caught in the
worldly pleasures.
How would you feel then,
grandsire?
When after 25 years
of struggle
you gave Hastinapur
a king
who is invariably
incapable?
I am the testimony to
your capability.
I know there isn't anyone
more capable than you.
While in his last moments,
sage Kindam asked me a question
as to what kind
of a king was I.
I couldn't distinguish between
a mystical deer and a human!
This question of his is
haunting me, grandsire.
We kept brother away
from the throne
stating that he's
incomplete.
But as a king
what sort of completeness
have I established?
I supplicate before you
let me go live in
the forest.
Let me fulfil my punishment
and improve my karma.
May God bless you.
To improve karma
is important for a human being,
Your Highness.
When one's soul
burns in hell
the pain is just unbearable.
Hence
to atone for one's sins,
during one's lifetime
is a good deed.
- Stop rambling, Shakuni.
I am not rambling,
Your Highness.
I am not rambling.
If I was in the place of
King Pandu
then I too would have
done the same.
I would have taken
the Lord's name
and spent the rest of my
life doing penance.
And I would have
permitted you too.
But I cannot permit Pandu to
go live in the forest.
He is my brother.
The very thought of him
living a difficult life
makes me shiver.
Difficult!
Difficult!
You, in true sense, are
generous, Your Highness.
You're generous.
For real, my sister
is blessed to have you.
She is very lucky.
Just like how
on a lotus leaf
a drop of water
cannot hold on.
In the same manner
sin
crime
temptation
greed
cannot hold on to
your pure heart.
Why are you changing
the topic, Shakuni?
What does my heart
have to do with this?
For me this is what is
important, Your Highness.
The brother
who deceitfully
dethroned you...
The one who
amidst the entire
royal assembly
had you humiliated...
But yet towards
the very same person
you have so much affection
within you.
You instead of
being worried of the future
of your unborn son
are worried about the
pain of your
deceitful brother.
You are great, Your Highness.
You are great.
Brother Shakuni!
Sister Gandhari!
The use of words
should be used as
a medication
so it can heal the pain
of one's heart.
But to use those words
to trigger the pain
is not right.
Wonderful, Gandhari.
Wonderful!
After marriage,
a girl turns into a woman
and becomes capable of giving
advice to her brother
is what I had always heard.
But I'm seeing it for the
first time today.
I'm not giving you
any advice.
I'm requesting, brother Shakuni.
Don't do anything to
divide my family.
I'm not trying to divide,
sister Gandhari.
I'm not trying to divide.
May Lord Yama claim
my life, if I'm doing so.
I'm showing His Highness
the right path.
You have blindfolded yourself.
Your marital commitment
is unbelievable.
But
to inform His Highness about
the ditches in the path
has to be done by
someone after all.
Brother Shakuni...
- Hear me out!
His Highness
will be the one to decide
as to what's right
and what's wrong.
After King Pandu
Hastinapur's throne
shall see your son
as the king.
This is the least hope
His Highness
might be having.
So when the time comes
will King Pandu,
for the sake of your son
abdicate his authority?
Will he do a deed
as great?
Greatness! No!
No.
Had he such greatness
in his heart
would he have
been deceitful towards
his elder brother?
When destiny has played its game
and King Pandu,
of his own will
is abdicating
the throne of Hastinapur
then who are we,
mere humans
to disrupt the plot of destiny?
I just had to say this.
The rest has to be thought over
by His Highness.
Good bye, Your Highness.
Lord
please tell Pandu to give up his
decision of going to exile.
Remain silent
and let me gauge the situation,
Gandhari.
What's the situation indeed for
us to accept a life in exile?
The sin of killing the sage
was unintentional, wasn't it?
This is not the punishment of
the sin, Madri
but of being unaware.
If a king starts committing
crimes unintentionally
justice and peace can
never prevail in the kingdom.
When you had asked me
to get the deer skin
I should have given that
a thought then.
That means the fault is mine
and I accept that.
Punish me for that
but how is it necessary for you
to bear the harshness of exile?
No, Madri. It's not your fault.
Asking something to a husband
can't be a fault. - Then who's
the one to be blamed for?
His Highness'?
The attempt of trying to fulfil
my wish
is a mistake, isn't it, sister?
I understand.
All too well.
Henceforth, His Highness will
always listen to you
and not me.
I promise you.
I didn't mean that, Madri.
- Don't find faults, Madri.
Try to accept that the mistake
has been made. - I do accept.
I have made a mistake
but the consequences will have
to be borne by our sons
who have not yet come
into this world.
If they take birth in the forest
they will be left wanting of
their right over the throne.
Madri, the ones who haven't
been born as of yet
why to plan for their future?
Whatever they will be
destined to
will be their fate.
I am a princess.
That my progeny would
be enthroned as ruler
is what I have been
taught since I was a mere child.
So I have the right to ponder
about their future.
In the Kuru lineage,
it's not right
but competence that has
the upper hand, Madri.
Will only your sons have that
competency
and not mine, sister? - You both
can never bear sons.
What do you mean by that, Lord?
I curse you
if you ever try to establish
marital relations with a woman
or try any conjugal acts
with her then you shall die.
This is the reason
why I have decided
to go into exile.
I'll also come along with you,
Lord.
No, Kunti. The harshness
of exile are not meant for you.
You both will stay here
in the palace.
- Without a husband
the palace seems
to be like a forest
but if the husband is beside one
then even the hut in a forest
equates a palace.
I still can't understand
the meaning of your decision
but if you've already taken
a decision
and sister is going with you
then I too shall come with you.
If sister's place
is by your side
then I share the same fate too.
I have come to Hastinapur
along with you
and I shall go along
wherever you take me.
It will be a place
devoid of amenities.
Only hard work would be
in your destiny.
The crime was done by
the three of us
so is the predicament
we are in
and thus will be the atonement
done by us.
Lord, please go ahead with the
arrangements for the journey.
Madri
you must get ready
for the journey.
Sorrow, anguish, planning
and projection...
My consciousness is far away
from every such thing.
Everything seems
befuddled to me.
Bhishma, I'm unable
to find a way out.
You are being hopeless
but in vain.
There's a reason behind
being dejected, Bhishma.
Do you see that boat?
Even the intense flow
of this river
can't drown this boat.
But even if a small hole
appears in this very boat
then the same boat will drown.
A similar hole
now gapes at us
whilst being in
the empire of Hastinapur.
If Pandu abdicates
then Hastinapur
will again become weak.
Weaker than before
because now
subjects will talk about it.
The rumours will be spread.
The subjects will be upset
see the king leaving.
And the kingdom where the
subjects are upset and disturbed
becomes very weak.
You are aware of it, Bhishma.
I will
not let the throne
of Hastinapur stay vacant.
We shall declare Dhritarashtra
as the king.
But it's against
righteousness and tradition.
Dhritarashtra shall
not be coronated.
He will be a de facto king.
He won't be able to carry out the Rajsuya 'yajna'.*
*The king's inauguration sacrifice performed by the ancient kings who considered themselves powerful enough to be an emperor.
But he'll be able to mete out
justice and righteousness.
You are quite apt,
Bhishma.
In the future, any child
being born in the Kuru lineage
shall be coronated.
But, Bhishma, will
Dhritarashtra accede to this?
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Your Highness, forgive me.
I have made a big mistake,
Your Highness.
What happened, Shakuni?
Your Highness!
Your Highness
I told Bhishma
that the throne
offered up just as alms
won't be acceptable
to you.
I have made a big mistake,
Your Highness.
You are quite apt, Shakuni.
I don't consume
food partaken by others.
I don't accept
anything in charity.
Charity!
In know it, Your Highness.
Now I have started
to understand you
that's why, before anyone
could even think about
enthroning you
I diverted the topic.
But I thought about it,
Your Highness.
The king of Panchal may not
belong to the Bharat lineage
he at least hails from
the Chandra lineage.
Then why don't we invite him
to manage our
kingdom of Hastinapur?
What are you
rambling about, Shakuni?
I can get you beheaded
for this thought.
But, Your Highness, someone has
to be the ruler, after all.
And your son is
still being nurtured
in my dearest
sister's womb.
He can't be coronated
until you become a king.
But you consider
your own kingdom
as a charity.
Pandu will have a son.
He will become the king.
Until then, the responsibilities
of the kingdom
shall be handled by Queen Mother
and grandsire, okay?
King Pandu can't have children,
Your Highness.
What?
- I have learnt
that sage Kindam has
cursed your brother.
If taken in this manner
this is not charity,
Your Highness.
If you are considering
it to be charity
then there's no other way out.
Attention!
His Excellency Bhishma
is arriving.
Greetings, grandsire.
May you have a long life.
Greetings, grandsire.
Greetings.
Dhritarashtra,
after Pandu's exile
the throne of Hastinapur
has become vacant.
It needs a king.
Dear, the council of ministers
has decided
that in Pandu's stead
you should be announced
the de facto king.
For the sake of
Hastinapur's welfare
you will have to shoulder
this responsibility
Dhritarashtra.
My life is more precious.
Dear Prince. Why are we
at such a desolate place?
You will know
soon enough, Ullok.
Fireflies.
They twinkle like my beloved
sister's eyes.
Now Gandhari shall never have to
fear darkness, Ullok.
Catch them all.
Shukra.
Shukra.
My friend.
So you've brought news
from the capital.
Dhritarashtra?
Dhritarashtra!
Dhritarashtra!
Dhritarashtra!
I heard that Bheeshma,
the son of Ganga
had been to lay siege
on Vidarbha.
Not Vidarbha,
he'd been to Gandhar instead.
Have the Kuru's ever
attacked anyone?
Bheeshma had been there
with a marriage proposal.
Greetings, grandfather. - May
you live long, Dhritarashtra.
Greetings, grandfather.
- Vidur.
Greetings, grandfather.
- Pandu.
Greetings, mother.
What do I even bless you,
my prodigal son?
A blessing for a long life
is futile
for you have a boon,
to choose your death at will.
A mother always
blesses for happiness.
As long as the throne of
Hastinapur lies vacant
how can I ever
be truly happy?
An orchard
full of fruit laden trees
And a derelict throne,
without a king
suffer the same
ill fate, Bheeshma.
The one who bears the duty
of guarding either of these two
shall forever be sleepless.
I'd sent you to find the path
to our happiness, Bheeshma.
Has the king of Gandhar arrived
with Gandhari? - Mother.
They couldn't come along.
King Subal pleaded with me,
that he wishes to conduct
Gandhari's wedding with great
pomp and splendour.
He shall bring his entire family
along with Gandhari
and arrive in Hastinapur, before
the eve of 'Akshaytritiya
Besides, after so many years
this would be the first wedding
in our clan too.
Even we shall have to invite
Kings from other kingdoms.
If you'd brought them along,
I'd be even happier.
But I hope you did
what you felt was right.
Ambika.
Commence with the
preparations for the wedding
of your eldest son,
Dhritarashtra.
Daughter-in-law, before
king Subal arrives here
have a token of ornaments and
other gifts sent to Gandhar.
As you say,
mother-in-law.
I'm feeling very glad today,
elder brother.
Even I am very glad,
Bheeshma.
Now the throne of Hastinapur
shall forever be secured.
The promise I had made to your
father, shall be fulfilled now.
Gandhari's hundred sons
shall brighten the Kuru clan's
future for eternity.
Pandu. Convey the good news to
the royal teacher Kripacharya.
Also command the announcer Uttam
to announce across the kingdom.
On the eve of 'Akshaytritiya
prince Dhritarashtra's wedding
to princess Gandhari,
shall be solemnised.
Soon thereafter
Dhritarashtra
shall be crowned and enthroned
as the king of
Hastinapur.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Pandu.
- Greetings, elder brother.
Do you know how many steps
you need to take
to reach the throne
from where you're standing?
No, brother.
Fifty-one.
One, two, three..
four, five.
I have measured the distance
to the throne
from every door
within this room.
Six, seven, eight..
Nine, ten.
Do you know why?
Because right since birth, I had
been heading to this throne.
But how far is it now?
Tell me.
Fifty-one steps?
- No. lt's one.
Just one.
And the name of that one step
is wedding.
Then I shall be seated there,
upon my throne.
The biggest dream of my life
shall come true, Pandu.
And then, she shall sit there
as my eyes.
My Queen.
A token of ornaments and drapes
have arrived from Hastinapur
for you, princess.
Look at them, princess. They're
such beautiful ornaments.
Yes, they're very beautiful
indeed.
They truly befit the status
of the queen of Hastinapur.
When you shall wear this and sit
upon the throne of Hastinapur
your beauty shall be celestial,
princess.
I'm a royal princess.
Someday I had to be a queen.
But you have no experience
with ruling, princess.
Then how shall you rule?
It's very simple.
Where there's no experience,
affection comes in handy.
With my devout affection
I shall win the hearts of
the subjects of Hastinapur.
Right now, l'm not concerned for
Hastinapur's subjects.
I wish to rule the heart
of my beloved husband.
Winning the subjects' heart
is easier, princess.
But winning the heart
of your husband
especially when
he's a king himself
is a little difficult.
All the beautiful damsels
in the world
must be flocking
around him.
I'm not afraid
of that competition.
If that were the case,
Hastinapur wouldn't travel here
all the way to Gandhar,
to choose me.
I shall get him so spell bound
with my beauty
that the Kuru prince's eyes
shall only look at me.
Then through her eyes,
l shall look at the royal court.
Even when a person
is quiet
he says a lot through the
expressions on his face, Pandu.
My wife shall be my eyes,
and read the expressions
on the faces of the courtiers.
I'm glad, elder brother, that
you shall soon get your eyes.
Anyway, you do not trust
your younger brother.
No, brother.
lt's not so.
I trust you completely.
But, you shall not be
with me always.
Sometimes you shall be at war,
as the commander-in-chief.
And sometimes, you shall
be off for leisurely travel.
And l need eyes that shall
stay with me always, brother.
Incessantly.
A husband needs a wife
at every step, elder brother.
A wife heeds her husband
in transactional matters.
She stands by him
during religious deeds.
And shows him the path
to redemption.
A wife's arrival fulfils
a husband's life, elder brother.
These are all useless talks,
Pandu.
Power.
Power is supreme
in transactional matters.
That is the foundation
for religion.
And the path to redemption.
That's all.
There is no need
for a wife, for that.
For me, the significance
of my wife is just that
she shall fulfill this
one thing l lack.
That's all.
There shall be nothing
more precious than me
for my husband,
Sugdha.
The way father consults mother
regarding every matter
my husband too shall consult me
regarding every decision.
We shall teach our sons about
good values and happiness.
My husband shall show me
around his entire kingdom.
He shall hold my hand
and walk ahead.
And I shall lay my every step
upon his shadow.
As the eldest brother and
his beloved wife
the journey of our lives
shall be truly successful.
The foundation of all human
relationships
is expectation.
A husband, who could fill
life with joy and prosperity.
A wife, who is always
dedicated and loyal.
Children, who shall always serve
and obey.
Human being.
An individual usually
loves the person
who meets his expectations.
But expectations are destined
to be broken.
How?
Because expectations
originate from the human mind.
No one else ever learns
of those expectations.
In spite of all intentions
to fulfill them
one can never fulfill
another's expectations.
And that is the root
of conflict.
All relationships
turn into conflict.
If humans stop building
their relationships
based on expectations
and accept relationships
solely for what they are
won't this life be full of
peace and happiness?
Think about it.
Shukra.
Look, Sugdha. We just spoke
about brother Shakuni.
And he's already sent
a message.
So many fireflies?
You see, Sugdha?
Brother Shakuni went through
so much of trouble for me.
Just so that my chamber
shouldn't get dark.
Even brother Shakuni must
have surely arrived.
Shakuni. Son, we were
waiting for you.
What is the use of waiting now,
mother?
Son, control your anger.
A huge army had arrived from
Hastinapur, with the proposal.
And Bheeshma himself
was supervising them.
We had no other choice
than to accept the proposal.
Son, your father shall
explain the situation.
Who shall explain?
A father or a king?
Shakuni. A king cannot ignore
his royal obligations.
You said it right, father.
lt was your royal obligation.
To marry beloved Gandhari
to Dhritarashtra.
It was only your
royal obligation.
She's a daughter who gave you
so much of love and respect.
And you are being
unjust to her..
It's only your
royal obligation.
You are darkening the future
of my beloved sister.
It's only your
royal obligation.
What use is
a royal obligation
where you need to sacrifice
the royal family?
Where is your
greatness now?
Where is your strength,
king Subal?
Or are you consumed by the greed
to expand your kingdom
with the aid of
Hastinapur?
And has that greed overpowered
your love for your daughter?
Answer me.
I love my daughter Gandhari
too, son.
And I had to come to that
decision with a heavy heart.
Because emotions
make you blind.
You must give up emotions and
think about the circumstances.
Tomorrow you shall be
the king of Gandhar.
And as the king of Gandhar
you cannot be blind
to Gandhar's future.
I do not fear Bheeshma.
Father, when might fails
one must use deception.
I shall attack the kingdom
of Hastinapur so cleverly
that the entire kingdom
shall be reduced to a rubble.
I do not respect
any such obligation
that is a hindrance in
my beloved sister's future.
Even if I have to do the
most disgusting deeds
for the sake of Gandhari,
I'm willing to do it.
I will gladly accept hell.
But I shall not let my beloved
sister's future be darkened.
I will never allow Gandhari
to marry a man who is
blind since birth.
Never.
Gandhari
Grandfather used to worship
Lord Indra every year, Uncle.
But why did you decide against
worshipping him for once?
Abhimanyu, my lad.
All injustice that prevails
in the world is one.
Because all injustice
arise out of one or the other
form of fear.
I did not mean to oppose
the veneration for Lord Indra.
But he was being venerated
solely out of fear.
In fact, no one was
venerating Lord Indra, lad.
Everyone was just venerating
the fear in their hearts.
But isn't the prevalence of fear
obvious, uncle?
No, lad.
In fact, there is no greater
foe in the world than fear.
You better know
the consequences of fear.
In order to be free of fear
a human accepts injustice.
That is where evil is born.
Ought to fear, a human mind
is filled with worry
and conflict.
He loses his ability to think.
The mind or the soul
is destroyed.
Due to fear, a human mind
is filled with bitterness.
His entire life is filled
with bitterness.
The joy of living is lost.
Soulful joy.
Sachiddanand* is the incarnation of the almighty, lad.
*The three qualities of God. Sat is truth. Chit is universal consciousness. Anand is Bliss.
Ought to fear, a human
drifts away from the almighty.
[MUSIC]
But Indra's veneration wasn't
so grave an injustice, uncle.
Prativindh, my lad.
No power is so great
that it cannot be defeated.
And no injustice is so minor
that it need not be defeated.
Because a minor injustice
with the passage of time
can attain a catastrophic form.
Am I right, my good lady?
[MUSIC]
Revered clown!
After destroying
Indra's arrogance
what did Lord Krishna do?
My Prince!
My Prince!
The glorious tales of
Lord Krishna are endless.
If you all permit, could we end
this tale narration right here?
It shall be sunrise soon.
And as dawn breaks
the wedding rituals
will commence too.
No, dear clown.
After tempting one with food
and describing the taste
of every morsel
you cannot deprive one
from food.
You have to tell us the tale
of the end of Kansa,
the Lord of Mathura.
[MUSIC]
[LAUGHING]
Very well, listen.
Darkness encroached into Mathura
and nested within Kansa's mind.
Kansa's despicable heart
lost all love and compassion.
Fear gripped his mind
and arrogance corrupted him.
When his final moments
closed in, he lost all wit.
Vasudev!
Is the head of Gokul's Yadavas
your friend?
What do you wish to know,
Kansa?
His son has lifted
Mt. Govardhan!
How could he be so powerful?
Who is he?
Are you suspicious,
elder brother
that he is my son?
But the eight child
my womb bore was a girl.
She was an illusion!
[MUSIC]
Your womb had borne an illusion
in order to deceive me!
Vasudev had surely transferred
your eighth son to his friend's
home to safety.
No, elder brother!
You had all the infants
born during that time killed.
Then how could that infant
still be alive?
Tell me!
Calm down, Devaki.
The time has come
that Kansa braces himself
for his death.
Listen, Kansa.
The monsters that you had sent
have met their death.
Even demoness Putna* has met her death.
*Putana, a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him, though it was with the motive of killing Krishna by poisoned milk. She was killed by the infant-god Krishna.
Yet you did not understand.
Firstly, let me tell you
about Devaki's seventh child.
Devaki's seventh child
in the seventh month
was transferred by the Gods
to the womb of
my second wife, Rohini.
His name is Sankarshan.*
*Meaning a spirit transferred between two wombs.
Since he is mighty, he is also known as Balram.*
*"Strong Rama".
He is safe at
my friend Nanda's home.
And my eighth son's name is
Krishna!
[ECHOING]
[MUSIC]
Son of Nanda, Krishna!
He has even defeated
the serpent Kalia
and has lifted Mt. Govardhan
on a single finger.
My lord, my brother is further
blinded by arrogance.
He shall kill our son!
My lord!
If it were possible
to kill your son
it would have happened
years ago.
Even the King of Heaven
couldn't defeat him.
So how can the King of Mathura
defeat him?
You are a fool, Vasudev!
A fool!
I shall soon compel
both your sons
to arrive to Mathura!
And they shall die
before your very eyes.
Revered Akroor!
Head to Brindavan soon
and fetch both those lads
to Mathura.
You are inviting
your own death, Kansa.
My death?
My death, Akroor?
As long as Vasudev
and Devaki are alive
I shall be protected
by these two.
Their sons
ought to the fear of their death
will willingly give up
their lives.
Go on!
Bring Krishna and Balram
to Mathura.
No, revered Nanda!
Stepping on this holy land
has sanctified my life.
Gods dwell within idols.
But even the temple yard
is considered holy.
Similarly, all of Brindavan
is holy.
The ones to liberate Yadavas
from Kansa's atrocities...
These celestial lads
were raised on this holy land.
Son, the king of Mathura,
Kansa, has sent an invitation
for you.
I am ready, sire.
Last night father Nanda
narrated us the tales
of the sacrifice of mother
Devaki and father Vasudev.
Their sacrifices have not
yet borne fruit, my boy.
The clouds have to shower
until their existence
is obliterated.
Maybe Kansa shall use
your parents as shields
and try to attack you.
If the moon hides
behind a hill
isn't it obscured, sire?
If a deer hides behind a bush,
does a lion not devour it?
The sacrifices that my parents
made...
I won't let it be in vain.
If I have your permission
- may I gain my mother Yashoda's consent?
- Sure.
Even I shall bid farewell
to mother Rohini.
Sire Akroor, now the son
of Yashoda
will be the son of Vasudev.
So far...
So far, I kept him safe here
as long as I could.
Now, in Mathura please
watch over him.
Your son will protect
the whole world.
I needn't protect him.
For the sacrifices you have
made for Krishna
the entire world shall
forever be in your debt.
[MUSIC]
S-Son. How could you
abandon your mother
and leave from here?
Brindavan shall wither away
waiting for you.
The shepherdesses
will be grieved by
your departure.
And your mother...
- Your mother shall die...
- No, mother!
My soul dwells within your body.
And I am taking your soul
along with me.
If the soul leaves your body
I shall die instead, mother.
But why, son?
Why do you need to go?
My life's sole purpose
is to think of
protecting the entire creation.
And uncle Kansa
is just the beginning.
The end...
The end is still very far away,
mother.
I have to wander this
way incessantly for years.
And that life of a wanderer
begins today, mother.
Son.
Will you never ever return?
How can I return, mother?
I am leaving the Krishna
of Brindavan here
as I leave this place.
And the Krishna who is
going to Mathura
isn't the one you think he is,
mother.
When the river Ganga
flows down from the skies
she undergoes a lot of change.
She not just purifies earth
but get rendered polluted
by earth too.
She cannot return to Heaven,
mother.
Therefore...
Therefore...
[STUTTER]
Won't you remain
to be my son?
Will you be now
known as Devaki's son?
Mother Devaki gave me birth.
So some shall call me
the son of Devaki.
But I am fully confident
when I meet mother Devaki
for the first time
she shall surely address me
as the son of Yashoda.
And whoever shall know me
by your name
will know the true meaning
of duty and sacrifice.
Mother, bless me.
[MUSIC]
Krishna!
Mother!
[sesame]
Won't you feed me butter
for one last time
before I leave?
Please feed me, mother!
Krishna!
[MUSIC]
Your majesty. Please remove
the blindfold at least for once
and look at your sons.
Even my Lord hasn't seen
his sons, Sugadha.
And they shall look as good in
vision as they do through touch.
Gandhari!
Gandhari! Dear sister.
Have all your sons taken birth?
- Yes, elder brother.
Only, my daughter is yet
to be born.
That shall happen too.
Her birth isn't significant.
It is the hundred sons
that are important.
Brother!
I mean, she is important too...
Absolutely important.
Your daughter is significant
only to you.
But for the throne of Hastinapur
and to defeat Pandu's sons
your hundred sons have
a higher significance.
It seems, Shakuni
that you have prepared
for battle already.
It's possible that...
- Indeed, your majesty.
It is possible.
Possibility' is another name
for the cycle of creation.
How can I forget that?
But your majesty,
a race to the throne
and a race between two chariots,
are similar.
In both, there is a possibility
that victory comes easy.
But capability...
Competence.
Knowing one's capability
is always beneficial,
your majesty.
15 years later.
Come on, charioteer.
Faster!
Faster, faster...
What are you waiting for? The
chariot is stuck. Pull it out.
Be quick, charioteer.
Is he...
- He's my son, your majesty.
Karna.
How did that armour and
earrings appear on him?
It's God gifted, your majesty.
He bears them since birth.
Faster, faster...
Who are you?
A 'Kshatriya' or a 'Suta'?*
Traditional Hindu varna/social rank: 1. Brahmins, 2. Kshatriyas, 3. Vaishyas, 4. Shudras.
Stop!
My people. Today's contest
is devoid of any result.
None of the warriors succeeded
in toppling the flag.
It is a huge shame
on the entire Kuru clan.
The way a tree looks bare
upon all its leaves being shed
that is how our
empire looks today.
Devoid of bravery
bereft of glory.
Today, only one youth impressed
me with his prodigal skill.
My charioteer
Sushen's son, Karna.
My boy...
Come here.
Your skill in riding a chariot
has truly pleased me, Karna.
I have immense faith
that you shall be a charioteer
for a prince of the Kuru clan
and perform a victory march
on these very grounds.
Chariot riding skills!
On behalf of the nation,
charioteer Sushen's son, Karna
shall be granted a reward of
a hundred gold coins
for displaying exceptional
skills in chariot riding.
Karna.
Collect the reward
that his majesty has granted.
His majesty has protected you,
charioteer.
Or else,
for committing the crime
of displaying archery skills
despite being a 'Suta
you would have lost your life.
Do not try to rise above
your social status ever.
If the root which is bound to
be buried underneath the ground
rises above the surface,
it withers away.
Looking at your son's skills
as an archer
my mind is filled with
sadness and wonder, Sushen.*
*Adhiratha and Radha named Karna, Vasusena also known as Radheya (the son of Radha).
Forgive him, your majesty.
The society of Hastinapur
shall not forgive him.
The 'Kshatriya' soldiers and
warriors here won't forgive him.
If one keeps 'Ghee'* in a raw earthen pot
*A class of clarified butter.
the pot itself absorbs it.
Neither is that 'Ghee' useful,
nor is the earthen pot.
Skills beyond one's status
are of no use.
That is the fact, Sushen.
I have told him many a times,
your majesty
to give up his fondness
towards archery.
But...
But I...
I assure you, your majesty
that henceforth he shall
never touch a bow ever.
No, Sushen.
Archery skills are ingrained
within his soul.
Skills and craftsmanship
are a gift of god.
They cannot be repressed.
When a pearl attains full form,
the oyster opens itself.
You son's archery skills shall
surely surface as well.
And he is capable too.
But the society here won't
respect him for his skills.
It will punish him instead.
That is what I fear.
Here he shall have to
lay down his bow.
In the eastern regions,
the religion is liberal.
There, even other social classes
are allowed to pick up arms.
Tell your son that if he wishes
to learn Archery
he should settle down
in Magadha.
He must let go of his parents
and his homeland.
It saddens me, Sushen.
It is a tradition here, in the
Kuru' and 'Panchal' regions
that apart from a 'Kshatriya',
no one else has the right
to acquire combat and weapon
skills.
Tradition is the religion,
Sushen.
And religion always asks for
sacrifice and penance.
Religion resides
within tradition.
And it is true that traditions
maintain religion.
But is religion solely
due to tradition?
Think about it.
The truth is that as there is
a sculpture hidden within a rock
there is religion within
the traditions.
There is a sculpture
within this stone.
This stone is not a sculpture
itself.
To bring out the sculpture,
it needs to be broken.
The unnecessary portions
need to be chiselled off.
Similarly
religion must be
sought within the traditions.
If the tradition of Indra's
veneration hadn't been broken
to start the tradition of
Govardhan's* veneration
*The day Krishna defeated Indra.
the Yadavas wouldn't have found
the way to their salvation.
Thus, the one who leaves
tradition unchanged
shall be deprived of religion.
And the one who blindly follows
tradition too
cannot acquire a religion.
They say that a swan has a
wisdom for distinguishing.
It leaves out the water
in the milk
and consumes only the milk.
Then, to acquire a true religion
is it crucial to possess wisdom
arising out of knowledge?
And without such a wisdom,
it is possible that one accepts
a religion, which is not
a true religion at all.
Think about it.
Oh, prince!
What are you doing?
No! Forgive me, prince!
Run!
This is unfair.
No!
No, prince.
Please do not take away
my fish.
He tried to attack you with
a weapon, Dushasan.*
*Tough ruler/punisher.
How dare you try to attack me?
- No! No, prince!
Prince Dushasan,
a fisherman's boy
can never assault a prince.
He made a mistake, prince.
Forgive him.
I shall take his life.
I am the prince, Dushasan.
And I shall be the one
to dispense justice.
Step forward, lad.
Do you wish to say anything?
My prince, I was just protecting
my fish.
I did not lift my sickle.
A prince would never lie.
You have committed the crime of
raising a weapon
against a prince
and for that, you are
sentenced to death.
My prince. You may arrest him
and take him to the minister.
But I beg you,
not to take his life.
Yes, my prince.
After all, we fishermen are
your distant relatives.
The Queen mother hails
from our clan.
Please, don't be so harsh.
Forgive him.
Forgive him, prince. This boy
has no father as well.
Bring the boy forward.
Bring him here.
He must accept the punishment.
How dare you!
Break everybody's hands.
Prince..
- Break them!
Forgive us, prince.
Forgive us.
Break their hands!
Stop!
Duryodhan..
Dushasan.
- Uncle.
These fishermen have
insulted us.
They have raised their weapons
against us.
And I shall punish them.
Only the justice council
has the right to do justice.
Or perhaps,
the king himself.
Soldiers, arrest them all.
Duryodhan.
Come on.
Uncle, you say that I must
mould myself to become the king.
But when I try to do justice,
you won't let me.
You had started a war
back there.
Does anyone start a war, within
a city of their own kingdom?
They were up in arms, uncle.
Do not argue.
A rock can break a rock.
It cannot break water.
Power can defeat those,
who are powerful.
Those who have nothing,
cannot be defeated.
And water drowns the rock.
Angry and dissatisfied subjects
can knock a king off his throne.
It breaks a kingdom.
Don't you understand that?
So do the subjects have a right
to insult a prince?
My dear child.
When will you learn to
be diplomatic?
You mustn't let arise
a situation
that would lead to your
insult in the first place.
Now, if that old hag
pardons these fishermen
then word shall spread
throughout the kingdom
that Duryodhan
has no say
within his own royal family.
Whom do you mean by old hag?
That fisherwoman.
The Queen mother of Hastinapur.
Now we have to get the
the fishermen punished.
Uncle!
Don't let the bleeding stop.
This is a reward for your
foolishness.
Kripi
now, our son Ashwatthama
will never have to drink rice
flour mixture instead of milk.
My friend Drupad will rid us
of our poverty forever.
Let's go, son.
Let's go.
Drupad
do you remember something?
This is the same palace
and I was standing right here
in this spot.
And you
were sitting there
on your throne.
Long live, Your Majesty!
A Brahmin has come to meet you.
He says, he is your friend.
- My friend?
It is me, friend.
It is me, friend Drupad.
Your companion during your stay at the 'gurukul.'*
Seminary', -kula refers to the teacher's domain, comprised of the teacher's home and school, where students are embraced as part of the family.
Drona.
There you go. This mendicant
is the King's friend?
Have you even seen your clothes?
The guard stationed at the
palace should be punished
because he allowed
this person in
otherwise he will allow
every possible creature
to enter the palace.
A relationship like friendship
cannot be weighed
in terms of clothes.
It is about memories.
And my friend Drupad
remembers every moment
that we had spent in the
gurukul' of Sage Bharadwaj.
What are you rambling
on about, Brahmin?
What friendship are you
talking about?
Friend
what kind of a question is that?
I am Drona. The son
of Sage Bharadwaj, Drona!
You used to learn difficult
weapon movements from me.
Do you not remember?
I remember everything.
I know
you were a fellow student
in the 'gurukul.
But I do not remember
any friendship.
You do not remember
our friendship?
But friend...
Friend Drupad,
you had befriended me.
Do you remember the night
when we were herding cattle
and I had saved your life by
shooting a lion with an arrow?
Did you forget
that incident as well?
Try to remember, Drupad.
Try to remember that day.
Do you remember your reply?
You had insulted me
by umeashing your arrogance
in the royal court.
My soldiers
save my life every day!
That does not
make them my friends!
In a field
wheat and a grass called
rajak' grow together.
That does not make 'rajak
as valuable as wheat.
You had promised
to be my friend forever.
You said, we'd have the right
to each other's properties.
That we'd have the right
to each other's lives.
And that we'll divide
everything we get equally.
But
you forgot everything, Drupad.
It wasn't like I asked you
for half your kingdom, friend.
All I wanted
was two cows from you.
That's it.
Give this Brahmin
ten cows in charity.
I don't want charity!
The son of Bharadwaj
does not accept charity, Drupad.
Give me just one cow
for it is my right.
Your love
will be an example of friendship
to the entire world.
If you seek alms then go ahead.
I can write two villages
in your name
on a gold parchment.
But if you talk about rights
you will be sentenced to death
for insulting me
in my royal court!
Insult?
Drupad
my friendship seems
an insult to you today?
During the examinations,
you'd wait for me outside my hut
in order to gain knowledge from
me and to learn various arts!
Did my friendship not seem
insulting to you then?
Be quiet, Brahmin!
Getting additional aid
from a student in a 'gurukul
does not establish a friendship
that lasts for ages!
Did you teach me
anything special?
Regardless,
I was the one to learn
the son of Prishata, Drupad!
It was my intellect that
absorbed all the knowledge!
It was not
some miracle of yours!
If you prize your life
then go from here!
- Drupad!
When a friend breaks a promise
it is a more grave crime
than murder itself.
Another name of Sun God is 'Mitra'*
Friend, partner.
because He had promised
to illuminate the earth
and He has
never broken his promise.
And today...
Today, the throne that inflates
your arrogance, Drupad...
I promise you
I will have you removed
from that throne.
You have insulted my teaching.
You have insulted my art.
Then hear me!
When I come to take over
your kingdom
I will not do so
by drawing any weapon.
I will train my disciples
who will make you
bow before me.
I will train my disciples
who will make you
bow before me.
And today, I have
fulfilled my promise, Drupad.
Arjun
release Drupad of his shackles.
Drupad himself
will assist Ashwatthama
to the throne.
Drupad himself
will anoint Ashwatthama
with milk.
I had come to you so that you
would give my son milk to drink.
But today, you have
bathed him in milk, Drupad.
Yudhishthir,
your brothers and you
have achieved a great feat.
It has been established
that among the Kuru Princes
you are undoubtedly
the most superior.
Arjun
your valour will immortalise you
till the end of time.
Now, all of you
may return to Hastinapur.
Me and my son Ashwatthama
will stay here for a while
in order to chalk out
his kingdom's governance.
May you live long.
The situation I was once in
I will never let you be in it.
I return half the kingdom
conquered to you.
Go to the city of Kampilya
and rule half the kingdom
of Panchal in peace.
Besides, you have no son.
I return half the
kingdom conquered to you.
Go to the city of Kampilya
and rule half the kingdom
of Panchal in peace.
Besides, you have no son.
So, why don't you consider
my son Ashwatthama as yours
and help him rule
the kingdom, friend?
And forget everything
and become my friend
once again.
Panchal - City of Kampilya.
Hastinapur.
Where did Duryodhan
and all his brothers go?
They left for Hastinapur
long back, brother.
Maybe they lack the courage
to accompany us to Hastinapur.
How can he fall sleep
on an empty stomach?
That too on a horse.
Brother Arjun
has conquered sleep.
He can go without sleep
for a month.
And he can go to asleep,
irrespective of his environment.
Yes, I know.
People have conquered kingdoms
and my younger brother
has conquered sleep.
Nakul, we should
rest for a while.
I am famished.
Had I known that fighting
in a battle makes one so hungry
I would...
- What?
I would have fought
a battle every day.
One doesn't feel hungry
after a battle, brother Bheem.
One feels hungry
after winning it.
Are you awake?
But you were asleep.
The smaller the time period
between sleeping and waking up
the greater is
the success of man.
This is what our teacher says.
Even I know a person
who is the same, irrespective
of him being asleep or awake.
He keeps dreaming all the time.
Bheem
quit talking about Duryodhan
in this manner.
When one is agitated
trying to calm him
with soothing words
is most appropriate.
Brother, do you truly believe
Duryodhan will ever be at peace?
Will he ever accept his defeat?
Will he ever accept you
as the Crowned Prince?
No one can have
such a weak heart
where righteousness
cannot dwell.
Subhadra!
Brother, are you alright?
Why wouldn't I be, Subhadra?
It was you who was drowning.
You've forgotten your brothers
and stayed for so long
in Hastinapur.
I was afraid, Hastinapur had
become your in-laws' place.
Brother!
You are the apple
of my eyes, Subhadra.
Food tastes bland without you.
So, tell me.
Are you happy?
How can I be happy, brother?
I was terrorized
by that demon Kalyavan.
And brother,
I was so worried for you.
When you are worried,
you should meditate, Subhadra.
It helps immensely.
Besides, when one's
protector is Arjun
one need not worry at all.
Krishna!
No one can protect you from me!
Look, Kalyavan
is approaching us!
The other term for 'kaal
is death, Arjun.
There is not a moment when
death doesn't approach a person.
Why worry about it, Arjun?
But
one must find time to
talk to one's loved ones.
So, tell me, Subhadra.
How is aunt?
I hope, she is well.
My heart yearns
to seek her blessings.
If you wish to stay alive
to seek her blessings
then draw your weapon, Vasudev!
Neither can my Sudarshan Chakra
nor your arrows kill him.
He can be slain only by
the fire of a sage's wrath.
So, what do we do now?
We shall run away.
Stop, Krishna! Why are you
fleeing like a coward?
Face your doom!
Stop, coward!
Shepherd, stop!
Stop and face your death!
How can you flee the battlefield
when death approaches you?
The future generations
will call you Ranchhod* and laugh at you!
*One who leaves the war area or battlefield, another name for Shri Krishna, when he left the battlefield in war with Jarasandh so that Mathura could be saved from destruction, he then went to Dwaraka.
I know.
The future generations
will refer to me by the name
of Ranchhod as well.
And for that,
I am grateful to you.
Now, quit talking and attack.
Krishna!
You said, your brother Krishna
is a courageous person.
Then why is he running away
in this manner?
You'll never understand my
brother Krishna, Prince Arjun.
He must certainly have
a plan in his mind.
Courageous men
have only one plan
to defeat the enemy.
And here, I don't see
Kalyavan getting defeated.
Kalyavan.
Hey!
Hey, shepherd!
Stop!
Where are you hiding?
Krishna!
Show yourself!
Krishna!
Where are you hiding?
Krishna!
Instead of fighting me
he is sleeping here.
Wake up, coward!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Do accept my greetings,
great sage Muchukund.
I have grown up hearing
the stories of your valour.
Who was that
who, without any reason
got burnt to ashes by me?
Nothing happens in this world
without a reason, great sage.
Perhaps
getting burnt by you
was his destiny.
And in order to
reduce him to ashes
maybe the Almighty
had motivated you
to leave your kingdom
and meditate here.
Who can ever know?
But do pardon me for interfering
with your meditation.
Now, you need not fret
and can resume your meditation.
Are you happy now, Arjun?
Greetings, Vasudev.
No.
You need not seek my blessings
because you have
a place in my heart.
Didn't I tell you, Prince Arjun?
My brother must have
indeed had a plan.
How did you achieve this,
Vasudev?
How I achieved it?
Arjun, do you know
about King Mandhata
and his son, King Muchukund?
Yes. He fought battles
all his life
and had conquered
the entire world.
And then he gave up his kingdom
in order to rest.
Yes, Arjun.
That person is indeed
praiseworthy who realizes that
worldliness is labour
and meditation
is the only form of rest.
Most people deem
worldliness to be happiness
and keep tiring themselves
but they do not even
think about resting.
For years
great sage Muchukund has been
meditating in that cave.
He had not opened his eyes
for 100 years.
All this meditation had
garnered him so much power
that when he would open
his eyes after all this while
the first person he would
lay his eyes upon would
be reduced to ashes.
Kalyavan was destined
to die this way.
I merely brought
the various forces together.
That's it.
Arjun
you should come to Dwaraka.
I have to talk to you
about so many things.
I have heard so much
about your might!
The migrants
from Hastinapur said
that you had constructed
a canopy of arrows
to protect yourself
from the roof collapsing on you.
And you even defeated
King Drupad.
I could do so only because
of your help, Vasudev.
The stones that you gifted me
had eyes on them and because
of them I could figure out
as to who the real Drupad was.
The one who didn't
have restless eyes.
Wonderful, Arjun!
You discovered such deep meaning
from those stones?
In other words,
that's not the reason
why you sent me those stones?
- Not at all.
Those five stones represented
you and your brothers.
I liked them and hence,
I sent them as a gift.
Prince Arjun,
don't believe my brother
because what he does and what
he says never mean the same.
Subhadra
the intelligence of a man
and the situation he is in
helps him understand things.
When it rains, a Peacock dances
but the Common Hawk-Cuckoo
cries.
The true meaning
of what a person says
can be understood
only by an intelligent person.
No wonder people
misunderstand each other.
But Subhadra
do you feel no shame
in talking of your brother so?
If people hear you,
they will say I lie.
North-West, North,
North-East, East.
Dwaraka.
Haven't you established
this kingdom, Vasudev?
It has prospered so much
in so little time.
No, Arjun.
I have not established
this kingdom.
The Yadavas have
worked hard to establish it.
I have merely used
my intelligence
to guide them.
The entire region of Arya knows
that you have
established Dwaraka.
And you say,
you have done nothing?
I am not lying, Arjun.
The truth is, I
do nothing.
And the one who realizes
that he does nothing himself
only he can achieve
an important feat.
Brother!
Won't you come
to the city with us?
Will you finish your entire
conversation right here?
Subhadra, I'll be there.
You should take Arjun
to the city.
I
need to leave to execute
an exceedingly important task.
But I shall return soon.
Vasudev
if you don't mind
then may I accompany you?
You wish to come along?
In fact, Arjun, you will help me
a great deal by accompanying me.
Just give me the order.
But do remember, Arjun.
This task will be exceedingly
difficult for you.
The truth is, this task will be
quite gruesome for you.
I am the truth! I am complete!
I am life and I am God!
I am prime alphabet!
I am "Shamveda (melody knowledge)" among "Vedas"! I am
"lndra" among Gods!
I am the consciousness in animals! I
am "Kubers ( the Lord of Wealth, the god-king of the semi-divine Yakshas)" among the "Yakshas (benevolent nature-spirits)"!
I am "Shanker (Shiva)" among the "Rudras (Shiva's followers)"!
I am "Fire" among Demi-Gods!
I am "Summeru (a sacred mountain with five peaks, the center of all universes)" among mountains! And
I am "Brighu (one of the seven great sages)" among saints!
I am "Omkar (mantra)" among sounds! I am the
chant in "Yagyas (yajna, ritual of offerings)"!
I am the holy "Peepul (Ficus religiosa, sacred fig)" amoong trees!
I am the memory of intelligence!
I am intellect, constancy and
patience!
I am glow!
I am "Chitrarath (king of gandharvas)" among "Gandharvas (distinct heavenly beings)"!
I am "Narad (a Vedic sage)" among divine saints!
I am "Kapil (the founders of the Samkhya school of philosophy)" among sages!
I am "Uccheshawa" among horses! I am
"Airavat (a mythological white elephant who carries the Hindu god Indra)" among elephants!
And I am the lion among animals!
I am the eagle among birds and the
King among humans
and the "Vajra (diamond)" among armours!
I am "Kamdhenu (a divine bovine-goddess)" among cows!
I am "Vasuki (a naga, one of the King serpents)" among serpents!
I am "Sheshnag (a mythical snake with 5 heads)"! I am "Yamraj (lord of death)"!
I am the Rain God and the Wind God
as well!
I am Lord Ram! I am Holy Ganga!
I am the origin, sustenance and end
of creation!
I am "Bramha's" knowledge! I am
"Mahakaal (lord of destruction)"
and "Bramha', effect, victory,
nutrient
and decision.
I am punishment, power, strategy,
silence
and "Tattva ('thatness', 'principle', 'reality' or 'truth')" knowledge as well.
I am Vasudev, Arjun, Ved-Vyas!
There is nothing that is not me!
There is no place where I am not
present!
I am time
and I am life and death, Arjun!
I stand here as the death of all
humans present here!
Even if you do not raise your weapons
I shall slay them all!
Therefore overcome your desire
and comprehend your duties!
Shoulder the burden of justice!
Raise your "Gandiva" bow and
commence the battle!
Engage in battle, Arjun!
Engage in battle!
O' Madhava! O' Madhusudan*!
*Slayer Of Demon Madhu.
Today, all my doubts have been
obliterated!
Kindly return to your human form!
I shall obey every order of yours!
"Karishye vachanam Tava (thy will be done)!"
Krishna, with his "Yogic" illusion,
has imparted the entire Bramhic
knowledge
into Arjun's mind in a single moment,
Your Majesty!
Even I have attained sanctity by
this knowledge.
I indeed feel so!
There is not doubt anymore
that Arjun, with his great power and
resilience
has raised his "Gandiva" bow Your
Majesty!
What else is happening at
"Kurukshetra", Sanjay?
Continue describing everything to me
in detail.
The Pandava army is gathering for
its first day of formation.
The five Pandavas, are heading east
upon their horses, Your Majesty!
At the foremost position of the formation all five
Pandavas are upon their chariots, Your Majesty!
Because they have smaller army 
on their side,
they have assumed such a formation
by which they can penetrate into our
formation
and reach Prince Duryodhan at the
earliest!
What could be such a formation,
Sanjay.
Which has the capability to pierce
through an entire army?
The biggest strength of commanders-
in-chief
whose formation is immensely
difficult
and to control which is equally
difficult!
The one which is terrifying as the
armour of God Indra!
The "Vajra" formation!
The Pandavas have assumed the
"Vajra" pattern, Grandsire!
Order our soldiers to assume our
formation!
No formation shall be assumed at
this time, Prince!
There shall only be a retaliation to
their attack!
Soldiers!
Attack!
Attack!
Attack!
Attack!
Uncle Shalya.
Uncle.
Is that weapon in your hand called
as "delusionist" too?
- Or else, it won't work. 
- No, dear.
This weapon is called "your death".
Grandsire, I hope you remember your
vow.
You must fight the war with all
your power.
You must destroy their entire army
today
and get me to Yudhistir.
I want victory today, Grandsire.
Today.
As long as I'm alive
I won't let you get defeafed,
Duryodhan.
But as long as the Pandavas are
together
your victory is impossible.
Grandsire.
Ask them to form a squared planning.
We don't have time to build anything
now.
Let them get over with their
wreckage.
Arjun.
Ride the chariot towards Duryodhan.
At your command.
Madhav.
Grandsire. That eagle will eat our
army.
Why don't you say something?
What delusion are you in?
Prince Arjun, with much quickness
has destroyed the foremost part our
army's formation, My King.
All five brothers
are at a close proximity to Prince
Duryodhan!
They shall soon be facing Prince
Duryodhan!
What!
But why isn't Grandsire coming up with a
counter attack for protecting my sons, Sanjay?
Grandsire Bhishma!
The Pandavas are smashing through
our army!
If we do not counter them
they shall soon reach my dear lad
Duryodhan!
Why aren't you assuming a better
formation to counter them?
A crocodile always keeps it's mouth
open
until the fish fully enters into its
mouth with confidence!
I was awaiting Grandsire's blessings!
I have it now!
Now I shall duel with Grandsire!
Proceed, Krishna!
The time has come for the crocodile
to shut its jaws!
Untill all five Pandavas are together
we cannot reach Yudishtir!
Now, it is time to separate the
Pandavas!
Bheem, Arjun, Nakul, Sahadev...
We must stay together at all times!
A while later.
Uncle
what are you rejoicing over?
The Serpent King Takshak
got defeated
the cows reached Indraprastha
and even the reverence
of the city took place!
Very soon, they shall perform
the Rajsuya 'Yajna,' uncle.
Are you rejoicing
over this, uncle?
Uncle
this time,
your political games...
Were a success,
my darlings!
They were a success!
The Serpent King Takshak
may have been defeated
but the victory is ours.
Until Arjun completes
his penance and returns
the Pandavas
will not be able to conduct
the Rajsuya 'Yajna.
The opportunity to stop
the Rajsuya 'Yajna
is finally in our hands,
my darlings.
It is finally in our hands!
But uncle
how will we stop them?
Listen.
There are two great forces
in the Aryan region.
The Yadavas of Dwaraka
and Jarasandha of Magadha.
Both of them are enemies.
The strength of the Pandavas
are the Yadavas
because Krishna
is on their side.
If
the Yadavas
decide to help us
then the Pandavas
will never be able to conduct
the Rajsuya 'Yajna.
And Jarasandha
is an unrighteous man!
The Pandavas
will never be an ally
to Jarasandha!
But uncle
we have got the news
that Arjun and
the Princess of Manipur
Chitrangada have got married.
Uh!
And the Serpent King
Kauravya's daughter
Ulupi has also been
married to him.
In other words,
even Arjun
is getting married to magnify
his strength, uncle.
My darling,
do not worry about that.
Even with the aid of
the King of Manipur
and the Serpent King Kauravya
Indraprastha cannot become
a powerful kingdom.
The key element here
are the Yadavas.
But the Yadavas will
never side with us, uncle.
They will.
The leader of the Yadavas
is Krishna
and Krishna
never disobeys
his elder brother Balaram.
It is time now
to approach Balaram
and form an ally with him.
Very soon
we shall leave for Dwaraka
for this purpose.
You must become
Balaram's disciple.
You must learn the art of
fighting with a mace from him
and become a darling of his.
You will be married
to Balaram's beloved sister
Subhadra, my darling.
In the meantime
Arjun will be engrossed
in his penance
in the jungles
of the Aryan region
and wandering about aimlessly!
An arrow is formed
not with the aid of mantras
but with that
of one's heart, friend.
You must calm your heart down.
How do I calm
my heart down, Govind?
My Lord is travelling
by himself.
Neither does he have
domestic help nor security.
He is not wearing anything
on his feet either.
In this austere penance of his
who will take care of his needs?
And I cannot stop thinking
about this, Govind.
Worry is the most definitive
form of love, friend.
You are worried for Arjun
and that is no surprise.
But when I think about Arjun
I feel as though I am...
I am being unjust
to the rest of my husbands.
I am failing to adhere
to my oath, Govind.
This is a dreadful situation.
Perhaps, Sahadev should have
entered your chamber
to get the Gandiva Bow.
Then Arjun would not have to...
What are you saying, Govind?
Then Sahadev would have
had to leave the city.
How would I have been
able to bear that?
Then Bheem and Nakul...
- No!
Staying away from any of my
beloved family members
is unbearable for me, Govind.
Staying away from
your loved ones.
That sentence can be divided
into two parts, friend.
The first deals with distance
and the other with...
Love?
Yes!
Love .
In other words
the distance between two people
is not measured
by physical proximity
but by the depth of one's love.
You must calm
your heart down, friend.
You are not being
unjust to anyone.
Each of the Pandavas
is equally dear to you.
The benefits of Arjun's penance
will be reaped not only by him
but also by the entire
Kuru dynasty, friend.
You must be patient.
When you receive news
that may question your faith
you must remember
that time does not take
the path made by man.
Man must walk on the path
illuminated by time.
This is called fate.
So, will My Lord meet
with some danger, Govind?
How would I know that, friend?
You are able to see
the future, Govind.
I do not see the future, friend.
I only see man
and understand his nature.
The nature of a man
builds his future.
That is why, I am able to see
his future to an extent.
I do not know if danger
will befall Arjun or not
but I certainly know
that even in danger
he will see an opportunity.
That is why, there is no reason
to worry for Arjun, friend.
You must learn
to be patient, friend.
How can I be patient, Govind?
By making yourself believe
that no matter where any of your
family members is travelling
he is always near you
and in your loving heart.
Only still waters can
reflect an image, friend.
If you calm your heart down
then you will be able
to see Arjun in it.
Madhav
you had asked me to come
to the Somnath temple
to complete my penance.
So, here I am.
Prince Duryodhan,
this is the place
where Lord Shiva had freed
Chandra Dev from his curse.
Ever since, we have been deemed
the descendants of Chandra Dev
while we deem
Lord Somnath our Deity.
Here in Dwaraka,
all tasks
take place methodically
and ritualistically.
This way,
King of Gandhar!
The veneration of Lord Shiva
will be conducted first by you.
Why are you
embarrassing me, Vasudev?
High up in the sky
in the region of Garuda*
*A large mythical bird, or humanoid bird. Garuda is the mount (vahana) of Vishnu (Krishna).
no vulture can ever fly.
And I had been named
by my revered father
King Subala.
Shakuni
in other words
a vulture.
So, how can I perform
the veneration before you?
Why can you not,
King of Gandhar?
By having Duryodhan
and Subhadra married
the idea of forming an alliance
between the Kurus and Yadavas
was yours, was it not?
In other words
a vulture can now venture
in the region of Garuda
quite freely.
King of Gandhar
will you not pay your respects
to the sages present here?
I have heard
that paying one's respects
to Lord Shiva's devotees
makes Lord Shiva happier.
Certainly.
Vasudev Krishna!
This is the only man
who spoils all our plans.
When Balram proposed your name
to marry Subhadra
though he expressed
his happiness
yet I doubt him.
He is definitely brewing up
some plan
otherwise at such critical time
Arjun would never
have been at Somnath.
What game this man is playing
is completely beyond me.
I think it's called 'Lagori'.*
*Seven stones.
If you have put your mind
on hold, my dear
give some rest
to your tongue as well.
Why are you so worried
for Arjun's presence over here,
uncle?
Now he can't interrupt
my wedding.
If he abducts Subhadra
he would have to fight
Vasudev and Balram.
And Arjun
will never raise arms
against Vasudev and Balram,
uncle.
You are really not aware
of the true colours
of Vasudev Krishna.
The spider never eats
without knitting the cobweb.
Krishna's act without planning...
That's not possible.
He has got
a very dangerous mind.
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Friend Kama
do you know the importance
of this day?
Until now, my life was filled
with the darkness of the night
and unfulfilled dreams.
But henceforth, I shall have
the light of the day
and all my dreams
will be fulfilled.
And when it comes
to fulfilling your dreams
I shall always be
a step ahead of you.
Greetings, father.
Bless you, son!
Today, the dream
in these blind eyes
will be fulfilled, son.
The blind can only see dreams
and not the world.
That is why
the attachment to one's dream
cannot be seen
by people with vision.
The truth is
I am very happy today
and I feel as though I can see.
Truly.
Go on, son.
Go on.
Greetings, grandsire.
- Bless you.
Those who see only dreams
and not the world
are called blind.
Today, your dream
will be fulfilled.
I have firm faith that you too
shall be blessed with vision.
My dear!
My dear
what one needs to see and not
can be discussed later.
You must seek the blessings
of your mother now.
Greetings, mother.
Greetings, brother.
- Bless you, son.
Duryodhan
when old clothes are adorned
with new embroidery
it is done only on
the existing patterns.
That adds beauty to old clothes.
You must glorify the memories
of your brother Yudhishthir
when you become
the Crown Prince.
When old walls are painted with
a fresh coat of paint, mother
the old paint gets covered.
People will forget
my elder brother
because I will be
that good a ruler.
All hail Crown Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Crown Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Crown Prince Duryodhan!
- Greetings, father.
May you live long, son.
This wound will remind me
of how Gandhari
has met with grave injustice.
It is in the best interest
of His Highness
to have Duryodhan anointed
as the Crown Prince.
Until the sons of Pandu return
no one will be anointed
as the Crown Prince.
Uncle
the 'swayamvar' of
the Princess of Panchal
awaits me now.
Princess Draupadi herself
is awaiting none but you,
my darling!
Sons, you should rest
for a while now.
You must be tired from lifting
my weight all this while.
One who considers
his mother to be a weight
indeed gets tired.
You need not worry, mother.
When they get tired,
I shall lift you.
I had told them earlier
that I am capable of lifting
the palanquin by myself
but they refused
to listen to me.
We too must get the opportunity
to serve mother, brother Bheem.
But why do you not
help us lift the palanquin?
Have you seen how tall I am?
If I hold the palanquin
from one side
mother will have to sit
in a crooked manner.
Besides, this is probably the way to Naimisharanya.*
*Naimisha Forest lay on the banks of the Gomati River (in Uttar Pradesh now), between the Panchala Kingdom and the Kosala Kingdom.
We shall come across a village
or hermitage on this path soon.
Someone will guide us then.
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord! - I can see
people over there.
Wait right here.
Let me go check.
Oh, Lord!
May you live long.
Have a long life.
All hail Lord Vedvyas!
All hail Lord Vedvyas!
All hail Lord Vedvyas!
Go on, villagers.
One serpent had bitten him.
Do not take your anger out
on all the serpents.
Now, I am expecting some guests
whom I had been
awaiting for a while.
Go on.
Come over here.
I have been awaiting you in
this forest for three days now.
What is your name?
How can you expect the people
whose names you do not know?
Names are not the only mode
to get to know people, Bheem.
How did you know
that my name is Bheem?
I had heard that only you
can ask such questions.
Where is your mother Kunti
and the four brothers of yours?
Call them here as well.
My disciples have arranged
for you to rest and dine here.
Stay here for the night
and leave at dawn.
The great sage Vedvyas!
Greetings!
- May you live long.
May you live long.
Be seated. Lifting the palanquin
must have left all of you tired.
I knew
that the fire in Varnavrat
could never burn
the sons of Pandu.
But My Lord, it is our wish
that the world deems us dead.
My Lord
did we take
an appropriate decision?
Man has the delusion
that he takes all decisions
on his own
but one who lives by clouding
his vision with emotions
cannot take a decision
on his own, Kunti.
The truth is
those decisions
are taken by fate.
The decision you have
taken is appropriate
but very soon it will
become inappropriate.
What do you mean?
I believe, you shall
get your answers
in Kampilya,
the city of King Drupad.
When you leave tomorrow at dawn
while proceeding towards
Naimisharanya
all of you must take rest
in the city of Kampilya.
Kampilya?
Draupadi
to compete for your
hand in marriage
every King and Prince
of the Aryan region
is quite eager.
107 noble men
have come here with the
intention of marrying you.
It is quite evident from the
presents sent by the Kings
that your marriage holds
great political value.
I have understood the value
of my marriage, sister.
But what is my value
in this marriage?
Why are you asking
such a question, Draupadi?
I feel restless, sister.
Despite being served
in a gold platter
food does not become tastier.
Will the Prince
who wins the competition
be able to win me over?
The day of the 'swayamvar
I will certainly have
107 questions before me
but will there be
a single answer
to my questions?
Princess...
Princess!
Princess, take a look
at what I have brought for you.
What is that, Malini?
It is for you.
I have brought it for you.
The city of King Drupad
Kampilya, lies
right before us, mother.
We must look for
a place to rest here.
There must be an inn somewhere.
Who is he, sister?
He is Arjun.
Greetings.
Greetings.
King Drupad has sent
many such paintings to the spies
in every corner
of the Aryan region
to look for Arjun
and to invite him
to the 'swayamvar
so that he comes to the event
and gets married to you.
This is what King Drupad wants.
And what do you want, Govind?
She had stripped us
of our weapons in the court.
We will strip her of her clothes
before the entire court.
Empress Draupadi
will be disrobed by you!
Maid Draupadi will be
disrobed by me, uncle!
Only then will
the fire of being insulted
get extinguished
within me, uncle!
Splendid, my darling!
Splendid!
A woman having five husbands
has no dignity and this truth
will be revealed
before the entire world.
Look.
The Great Guru Drona
is making his entrance.
All hail Guru Dronacharya!
All hail Guru Dronacharya!
He has come here to see
the glory and respect
of his beloved disciples
but
he will get to see something
which has not been
witnessed by the world
until this day.
May His Highness have happiness!
No, Guru.
A disciple does not have
the right to bless his guru.
A river always flows downwards
from its source after all.
Despite garnering such success
you have not let arrogance
cloud your thoughts
and this makes me
exceedingly glad.
But do remember
that the virtues
of a successful person
do not lessen
the envy of others
but increase it instead.
The envy people had
towards Jarasandha
was not substantial.
However, the envy
people have towards you
is quite substantial.
That is why,
this game of dice
is going to be
played here today, Guru.
I am aware of that.
I am certain that none of you
will resort to unrighteousness
but you must
promise me something.
If you see something
unrighteous happening
then you must not pardon it.
Friend Karna
you must stay prepared.
I do not have faith
in Bheem and Nakul.
If they lose at the game of dice
then they might
draw their weapons.
I am always prepared
to protect you, friend.
But
the General of Hastinapur
is His Excellency Bhishma.
Before we draw our weapons
we will require his permission.
Grandsire is subservient
to the throne of Hastinapur
because he is its servant.
If the Pandavas
do draw their weapons
grandsire will have to
fight them.
Dear Duryodhan.
Greetings, grandsire.
Greetings,
His Excellency.
His Excellency!
Listen to me very carefully.
Do not attempt
to taint this ceremony.
You are aware
that I am a servant
to the throne of Hastinapur.
And now
Hastinapur has
willingly accepted the reign of
the supreme King Yudhishthir.
In other words
I am also a servant
to the supreme
King Yudhishthir now.
If Emperor Yudhishthir
meets with improper behaviour
or is made to face injustice
or any form of treachery
I will have to draw my weapon
in order to protect him.
I hope
you understand.
Indeed, grandsire.
But I am conducting
this ceremony
to forget the past
and bury the hatchet.
I had misbehaved
with Empress Draupadi
and this is its penance,
grandsire.
All I have in my heart
for the Pandavas
is love.
And may it stay the same.
That is in the best
interest of everyone.
Uncle.
This is what I had feared,
my darling.
For some reason or the other
that old geyser
always starts to preach
about righteousness
but
you need not worry, my darling.
I will find such a cure
for that old geyser
that the very definition
of righteousness
will have to be changed by him.
May His Highness have happiness!
With the permission
of His Highness
let the game of dice begin!
Grace the seat.
Come here,
brother Duryodhan.
Let's begin the game.
Greetings,
Your Highness.
With your permission
uncle would like
to say something.
Certainly.
Your Highness
in the world,
the game of dice
has a very bad reputation.
The thing is,
all the games
which have unclear rules
tend to be bad in general terms.
Even a life without rules
tends to be painful.
Your Highness
that is why,
before beginning the game
the rules of this game
need to be clarified.
Tell me,
King of Gandhar.
What are the rules?
Me?
No, Your Highness.
In order to come up
with the rules
one needs to have deep knowledge
of righteousness.
One needs to be fair-minded.
One needs to be experienced.
And righteousness,
fair-mindedness and experience
are embodied by none other
than His Excellency Bhishma.
His Excellency
I request you
to explain the rules
of this game
so that when the game begins
you have
nothing to say against it.
Do I have the permission
of His Highness?
Certainly.
Grandsire explaining
the rules of the game
would be best.
Pardon me,
Your Highness.
The game of dice
does not honour
the labour and competence
of a person.
It is a slave to fortune.
That is why
I do not approve of
this game.
But Your Highness
wise people say that something
orchestrated by the Almighty
for us is called fortune.
King of Gandhar!
Fortune is not something
that is unrighteous!
However, toying with
one's fortune certainly is.
And Your Highness
what rules
can be made for
such an unrighteous deed?
Come up with such rules,
grandsire
which can restrain
unrighteousness.
Come up with such rules,
grandsire
which can restrain
unrighteousness.
Then lend an ear to me.
First and foremost,
Your Highness
the ones to be most hurt
by unrighteousness in the world
are women.
And the recipients
of grave injustice
are again women.
That is why,
until this game of dice is over
none of the women
will be present in the court.
How is this correct,
grandsire?
All these arrangements
have been made
to honour the Empress after all.
Her presence in the court
is essential, grandsire.
Then this game of dice shall
not be played, Crown Prince.
Because I have firm faith
that the Empress
would appreciate music
more than a game of dice.
Oh no,
Your Excellency!
Her Highness has made
arrangements for the Empress
to see a host of apparels
and jewellery.
Besides, my darling!
Apart from their husbands
and maids, women of royalty
do not play a game of dice
with anyone else!
Your Excellency,
that is a valid rule.
But
the Emperor would require
some light meal during the game
for which the maids
ought to have permission
to enter the court.
This is what I request of you.
That sounds fair.
When called for
maids will have permission
to enter the court.
Your Highness,
the second rule will be
that both the players
in each of the turns
must only bet
objects of equal worth
in the game.
When one bets jewellery
only jewellery of equal worth
can be bet by the other.
That sounds fair, grandsire.
The third rule will be
that both the players
can only bet
those objects or items
to which
they have a right.
But the Emperor has the right
to the entire Aryan region,
grandsire.
But you do not have the right
to even a single village.
I am the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur, grandsire
and the throne of Hastinapur
rightfully belongs to me.
- In time.
And when it is time
we shall invite the Emperor
for a game of dice again.
But at the moment
you can only bet
Your apparels
jewellery
and gold coins in the game.
Objects of equal worth
will be bet by
the Emperor as well.
But grandsire
because of this rule,
winning and losing at this game
will have absolutely no meaning.
The game will be over
in just a few turns, grandsire.
Then what is
incorrect about it,
Crown Prince?
Do you not want
this game to take place?
I do not, Duryodhan.
Stop the game.
Stop the game.
I
apologise to Yudhishthir
on behalf of Hastinapur.
That is impossible!
I will not let this ceremony
get ruined, grandsire.
Do you have some sort of a plan,
brother Duryodhan
which is being obstructed
by these rules?
It is our plan
to please the Emperor
Prince Bheem.
And no rule
is an obstruction here.
Your Highness
with your permission
I would like to make a request.
Certainly.
Your Highness
be it a battle
a competition
or the game of dice
to a competent person,
these are nothing but games.
Then why do we play these games?
For wealth or for an empire?
No, King of Gandhar.
Upon being victorious
one garners glory, fame
and praise from the world.
The Emperor is correct.
No one is more intelligent
than the Emperor.
When man wins, there is
an appreciation in his pride
but when he loses, there is
a reduction in his pride.
The true property of man
is his pride.
Did I say something incorrect,
Your Highness?
You are correct,
King of Gandhar.
Pride is everything.
Then I request,
Your Highness
both the players
to bet their pride in the game.
But only to which they have
a right, Your Excellency.
And along with the right to it,
they ought to take pride in it.
Your Highness, such an object
can be bet in the game.
And out of the two players
when one of them
has no object in his possession
which he can take pride in
the game will be
deemed complete.
Brother Yudhishthir
what exactly does
brother Duryodhan possess
which fulfill
both these criteria?
We are aware of no such thing.
But we are well aware
of what the Emperor possesses,
Prince Sahadev.
The Emperor possesses
the entire Aryan region
in which he takes pride.
And whether beloved Duryodhan
can have possession
of even a handful of land
is certainly a question.
So, Your Highness...
Do you approve of these rules?
I approve of them.
Why does righteousness
get defeated, brother?
And why does
unrighteousness win?
Getting something is not winning
and losing something
is not being defeated.
It is merely the impact
of time, Subhadra.
Change is ingrained
in its nature.
Uncle
the fortunes have changed.
The flag of the Pandavas
has been lowered!
The fear in my heart
has gone away
forever.
No, my darling!
No!
Just because the reason
of your fear is going away
it does not imply that your
fear is going away as well.
When the reason of your fear
gets annihilated
only then does
the fear in your heart
truly go away.
That is why,
spies will follow the Pandavas
at my order.
Until the five Pandavas
are alive
the fear in your heart
is alive as well.
If something makes man fearful
then he has been defeated.
And despite losing something,
the person
who remains calm and composed
is truly victorious.
Times will change,
Subhadra.
Unrighteous people will
indeed be punished
and the flag of righteousness
will fly once again.
This is not the departure
of defeated soldiers
but the beginning of the journey
of victory of the Pandavas.
The struggles in these 13 years
will indeed
lead them to victory.
A few days later.
Panchali,
give me that vessel.
Let me go bring some water.
There must indeed
be a pool nearby.
Why is My Lord Nakul
not back yet?
Let me go check.
I shall come with you,
brother.
Nakul!
Brother Nakul!
Brother Nakul!
- Nakul!
Brother Nakul!
- Nakul!
Brother Nakul!
Brother Bheem!
Brother Nakul...
Brother Nakul!
Nakul...
Brother Bheem,
brother Nakul is not breathing.
Get up,
brother Nakul.
Sahadev...
Sahadev!
Sahadev!
Brother Yudhishthir
something terrible
must have befallen them.
Let me go check.
Stay here and protect Panchali.
The three of us could
go together, My Lord.
No, Panchali.
We do not know what kind
of trouble they ran into.
You must stay here.
Brother Bheem!
Nakul, Sahadev!
Brother Bheem!
Sahadev!
Brother Bheem!
They do not seem to be hurt.
And neither do they have
the symptoms of being poisoned.
My brothers
must certainly have been killed
by an illusory being.
I know
that you can hear me.
No matter who you are
you must bring
my brothers back to life
otherwise I shall
dry this pool up!
I, son of Pandu, Arjun
warn you--
No matter who you are...
A Yaksh,* demon
*Nature-spirits, usually benevolent, who are caretakers of the natural treasures hidden in the earth and tree roots.
eunuch, ghoul
an illusory being or ogre...
You must bring
my brothers back to life.
Panchali, had it
been a human being
he could not have held Bheem
and Arjun up for this long.
I must go.
I hope you will be able to use
this spear to protect yourself.
Let me come with you,
My Lord.
No, Panchali.
I do not know
what trouble awaits there.
If a trouble befalls
the five of you, My Lord
then it would be the same
for me as well.
Panchali
in the torch of justice
enkindled by Vasudev
you are the fire.
Before justice
reigns supreme again
your life cannot be
extinguished.
If none of us brothers
return alive
then you must go to Dwaraka.
Vasudev will illuminate
the path ahead.
Bheem...
Bheem!
Bheem!
Nakul...
Nakul!
Sahadev...
Sahadev.
Arjun...
Arjun!
What is this illusion?
Who are you
to have killed my brothers
for no reason?
Please show yourself.
Until I know who I am
fighting with and why
I will not take to arms.
I do not fear you.
I do not wish to insult you
unintentionally.
Please show yourself.
I am the King of the Yakshas
the master of this pool!
No human being has the right
to take water from this pool!
Yet your brother Nakul
tried to take water
from this pool
though he had no right!
That is why
I slayed him!
Son of Pandu
your brothers
challenged me to a fight
out of vanity!
That is why,
I taught the four of them
a lesson of my competence
and asserted my right
by slaying them.
Neither did you
create this water
nor the place from where
water can be taken.
Then how can you have the right
to this place, Yaksha King?
Taking water is no crime,
King of the Yakshas.
Then how could you
punish my brothers so?
Justice and righteousness
dictate that
my brothers must be
brought back to life.
Impossible!
However, by answering
my questions
if you are able to
make me contented
then I shall bring one of
your brothers back to life.
After the death of
the four brothers of mine
it is not possible for me
to live any longer, Yaksha King.
However, I wish to keep
one of my brothers alive.
That is why,
I will use my intelligence
to try my best
and make you contented.
Ask the questions,
King of the Yakshas.
Tell me what life
and death are?
Yaksha King, according
to the Rig Veda...
In the heart of
the supreme element
there was the desire to generate
the creation in the beginning.
The rays of that desire
spread all around
and thus were formed
the directions.
The desire of the Almighty led
to the genesis of the creation.
Three realms,
three qualities
and three dimensions of time
were created.
Many beings and elements
were born in the heart
of the Almighty.
Every being and element
is the Almighty himself, sire.
In other words
the Almighty is life.
If the heart of a person
understands this
then he can never be angry with
or envious of someone.
He walks on the path
of righteousness
and respects justice.
This is the essence of life.
And what is death,
Yudhishthir?
Tell me.
Because of love
selfishness and anger man
gets connected to another.
This tie is called attachment.
Because of attachment,
man deems his body to be life
while the disintegration of
the body is deemed to be death.
However, the entire world was
born in the Almighty's heart
and only in the heart
of the Almighty can it end.
Two people travelling
on the same path
can walk with each other
for a while
but then they get separated.
At that moment,
they feel
that the other person
has met with death
but in reality,
both the travellers
are walking down the same path.
Similarly,
what we call death
is merely the distance that
arises between two human beings.
Until the world exists
no being can truly disintegrate.
Then how can one
meet with one's death?
In other words,
King of the Yakshas
the Almighty is the world
and the world is life.
Death is merely a delusion
and an illusion.
Death is merely a delusion
and an illusion.
Wonderful,
dear Yudhishthir!
You have given satisfactory
answers to my questions.
That is why,
I shall keep my word
and bring one of your brothers
back to life.
Go ahead and ask
for the life of the strongest
person in this world!
If Bheem is alive
no enemy will ever be
able to challenge you.
The mighty Lord Hanuman
will protect your kingdom!
No, Yaksha King.
The greatest enemy of a person
is the grief housed
within his heart.
If three of my brothers are dead
then how will Bheem
be able to protect me
from that enemy called grief?
The truth is,
the grief within Bheem
will defeat him
and leave him weak.
Then ask for Arjun's life.
If the greatest archer
of the world will be alive
then the entire world
will benefit from it!
I know Arjun,
King of the Yakshas.
When he will find out
that the reason of his life
is the death of the
three brothers of his
his courage will wither
strength will leave his body
and his Gandiva will slip
from his hands forever.
If I ask for the life
of either Bheem or Arjun
then my mother will
also be unhappy.
Your mother will be unhappy
to have two of her sons alive!
What kind of an argument
is that, Yudhishthir?!
One of the sons of my
mother is alive, Yaksha King.
I am alive.
Now, the second wife
of King Pandu also has the right
to have one
of her sons to be alive.
My mother Kunti would want this
and I wish for the same as well.
That is why,
King of the Yakshas
if you wish to bring
one of my brothers back to life
then give my brother Nakul
the boon of life.
Wonderful,
dear Yudhishthir!
I am pleased.
I am Dharma Raj.
I had gifted Kunti and Pandu
with you as my blessing.
From that perspective,
I am your biological father
and I am proud
of my biological son.
I shall bring all your brothers
back to life.
My son is innocent.
Had you been confident
about his innocence
that would have been heard
in your voice, your majesty!
You have to do justice,
your majesty.
The way Pandu's sons don't have
the protection of their father
in the same way
you will have to stop
protecting your sons.
Your sons will study
at Drona's hermitage
for 12 years.
And in these twelve years
you will not try to contact
your sons in anyway.
Father.
Father!
What is this I hear?
I have been ordered to go
to the hermitage... - Quiet!
Learn to seek my permission
before entering my chambers.
Father?
Yes, I order you to go
and stay at Guru Drona's
hermitage along with
your brothers.
On the banks of the
river Rishabh
miles away from Hastinapur.
There you will concentrate
on your studies.
You will follow the
orders of your Guru.
And you will be kind to
Pandu's sons.
But why are you abandoning
me like this?
At least tell me the reason.
Because that is a
tradition, son.
Your arrogance
and to bring your contemptuous
behaviour back to the
path of righteousness
this is the only solution
I have, son.
But father, what arrogance
have I shown?
I always try to fulfill
your wishes.
And don't you want
me to be your heir?
That someday I should become
the king of the Kuru dynasty.
How dare you question me!
Whatever you did to
Pandu's son Bheem
was that my wish?
But, he is an enemy, father.
All of them have come here to
stop your wishes
from being fulfilled.
This is the way one should
behave with his enemies.
Enemy?
Had I told you that Pandu's
sons are your enemies?
Father, you were the
one to say that.
You had said
that life means ambitions.
Our dreams are the
assets of our life.
Whoever becomes an obstacle in
the path of achieving
our desires
it's our duty to eliminate them.
Father, I did as you said.
How am I at fault then?
Fault...
I do not know
what is your fault.
I only know that
I may have given you
wrong advise.
To proceed towards the hermitage
is the only choice
you have, son.
So you must go.
Thus, go there
and use all your competence
to become worthy.
Go!
But, father...
- Go!
Leave.
Every child coming
into the world
is totally uncivilized.
His inner self has no
good values
nor vices.
It means, by birth
a child possesses no good
qualities or vices.
Then how do they attain
good qualities or vices?
Have we ever thought about it?
What they repeatedly
hear from their parents
children accept the
same as values.
Like
a road is formed to reach
the village river
only because people have been
repeatedly walking on it.
It means, the desires
of the parents
can develop as vices or good
qualities of their children.
Isn't that true?
Yet, when they see
vices in their children
the parents are astonished
and unhappy.
The parents ask themselves
where did their children
learn such immorality!
The truth is that, the
parents unknowingly
sow seeds of immorality
in their children
which develops
into a tree
of depravity in their heart.
It means, the parents
who desire to make
their children
virtuous and righteous
have to first
control their own desires.
Isn't it necessary?
All parents should
think about this.
Subjects present in the court
the new generation of
the Kuru dynasty
are today heading towards
the most important
phase of their life.
Among the four phases
mentioned in the scriptures
the most important is
the student life.
In the coming times
the happiness of the subjects
and peace
both depends on
the love for knowledge
of the students today
and their uprightness.
After twelve years
when the princes come back
after finishing their studies
they would be capable of
giving the great nation
administration, security
and justice.
They will return after
having gained such knowledge
and I believe in that.
Long live the princes of the
Kuru dynasty!
Long live the princes of the
Kuru dynasty!
Long live the princes of the
Kuru dynasty!
Prince Duryodhan.
Prince Yudhistir.
On behalf of all the princes
you will ask the king for
permission and advise.
The rest of the princes
will bid goodbye to
their respective mothers.
It's time to leave.
Goodbye.
Bless you, dear.
Study well, dear.
Value the orders of
your Guru
more than you value
the orders of God.
You are wise, so I don't have
much to advise you.
Goodbye, father.
Bless you, son.
I have several ambitions
and dreams for you, my son.
Acquire knowledge
and come back soon to
prove your capability.
Hastinapur will be
waiting for you, son.
Goodbye.
- May you live long.
Goodbye.
- May you live long.
Your majesty...
Send off the children
with happiness and enthusiasm.
The children are leaving today.
They will return as radiant and
strong young men soon.
I am eagerly waiting
for the day
when my son, instead of
being guided by others
can determine a path for others.
The curd will make it
a happy journey
and the sugar will make
your journey sweet.
Bheem, extend your hand.
Mother, give it to my
younger brothers first.
Just a bit.
All three are kids.
It's not right for them
to eat too much.
It isn't right to waste
sweet curd.
Bheem.
Arjun.
Protecting your
younger brothers
is your responsibility.
Trust me, mother.
Now, I am stronger than Hanuman.
I will protect Nakul
and Sahadev.
But the question is
At times, Nakul talks a lot.
Who will protect me from him?
Bheem, my brother,
you will do that.
Yes, it's true.
I can protect myself from you.
It is a bit difficult.
I am very strong.
My sons, it's time to leave.
Be successful
is your mothers blessing.
I will be worried for you.
Mother.
Father always said
whatever we do, we
should give it our best.
I will always follow his advise.
I will surely acquire the
best of knowledge.
And with my archery skills
I will always protect
my brothers.
Son, I have full faith in you.
Go.
Look!
Looks like uncle
has made arrangements
for us to rest.
Come.
The Lord has ordered
you to get married
tomorrow at dawn
to Princess Hidimha.
And after that, we will
make a sacrifice
and worship the
new King and Queen.
Let's leave, mother.
Brother Yudhishthir,
let's leave.
Why is King Vrikodar so angry?
Did we make a mistake?
No, you have made no mistake.
We chanced upon this place
during our journey.
We did not come here with the
intention of ruling this place.
If that was the case then
why did you kill our King?
It is our tradition that the one
who kills the King
becomes the next King
and marries the daughter
or sister of the former King.
If this does not happen,
we will have no King at all.
There will be petty
conflicts amongst us
and our youth
will become misguided.
Be it humans or ogres
traditions are
the basis of society.
You have no right to toy
with our traditions.
Since you have
created this problem
you must also come up
with a solution.
Dear
you need not worry.
My son Yudhishthir
is a very intelligent
and righteous man.
He will never allow anything bad
to happen to your subjects.
But what will become
of me, My Lady?
What about our tradition?
I have accepted your son
whole-heartedly as the King
and as my husband.
The complexion and behaviour
of us ogres
may be different
from that of humans
but the heart
and the love within it
is same for all beings, My Lady.
But dear
the marriage of an ogre
and a human...
How is that possible?
The great sage Vishwashrava had
also married the ogre Kaikasi.
And they had a son like Ravan.
But they also had
Vibhishan, My Lady.
I promise you
that I will raise my sons
to be like Vibhishan.
Try to understand
my love, My Lady.
Is receiving clarified butter
either as sacrament or alms
not worthy of acceptance?
Accepting what is pure
has always been deemed correct.
So say the religious texts
of humans beings.
My love is also pure, My Lady.
Please accept me as your
daughter-in-law.
You are not only
a woman, Hidimba
but also the Queen after
the demise of your brother.
How will you
renounce your subjects?
And my son...
How can he spend
his remaining life
living amongst ogres?
Hidimba
it would be best
if you forget my son.
Appoint a worthy ogre
as the new King
and work for the welfare
of your subjects.
For a little while, My Lady!
If I can be the wife of
your son for a little while
then I shall spend my whole life
with those memories.
For a little while, My Lady.
Until our first child is born.
That child will become
the King of the Ogres.
I promise you, My Lady!
That after that child is born
I will not ask any of you
to stay even a day longer.
I promise you this.
You shall earn the merit
of giving alms to a beggar.
You shall earn the merit...
You shall earn the merit
of giving alms to a beggar.
You shall earn the merit...
Get up, dear.
My daughter-in-law
can never ask for alms.
Bring the garlands.
King Vrikodar
place the garland around
the neck of the Princess.
She will refuse
to wear the garland
but if you succeed in doing so
then you shall receive
the blessings of the Lord.
You shall get
only three attempts.
So, go ahead.
This is the first wedding
of the Kuru dynasty.
Had we received
uncle's blessings
I would have felt contented.
Is this marriage
correct, brother Yudhishthir?
Mother's decision
is always correct.
But
the marriage of an ogre
and a human...
Hidimba's love is pure, son.
Using shackles like complexion,
creed and correctness
to enslave love
is not correct.
Mother is correct.
Look at Hidimba's face.
It is glowing with happiness.
The look of happiness on
brother Bheem's face is no less.
I was just jesting, mother.
Go on.
All hail King Vrikodar!
All hail King Vrikodar!
All hail King Vrikodar!
Bless you.
Bless you.
Hastinapur.
A while later.
The priest from
the kingdom of Panchal
seeks permission
to meet His Highness.
May the Lord
bless His Highness
Dhritarashtra.
The King of Panchal has sent
you a present, Your Highness.
What is it, Duryodhan?
It is an earthen pot, father.
Since when did the King of
Panchal become so impoverished
that instead of a gold pot
he has sent an earthen one?
What is inside it?
Only an earthen pot can
hold fire, Your Highness.
The Prince ought to know this.
There is a letter for you.
- What does it say?
Nothing is written
on it, father.
Duryodhan
hold this letter above
the fire in that pot.
The message will appear.
Then do it yourself, Minister.
Your Highness
a 'swayamvar' for the
Princess of Panchal, Draupadi
is being held
and this is its invite.
What is the meaning of sending
an invite in this manner, Vidur?
Our Princess was born
from the fire, Your Highness.
And this magical pot has
the power to bear fire in it.
If there is such a
Crown Prince in the kingdom
then he is invited to take part
in the competition, My Lord.
Was that an invitation
or an insult, father?
It is just like fire, beloved.
Just like fire.
If one can control it
it gives life
but if one cannot
it leads to death.
The truth is that this letter
is an invite
and also an insult.
Is there a Crown Prince
in Hastinapur
who can be sent
to this 'swayamvar?
Certainly.
I am the heir to this kingdom.
But my beloved
you have not yet been
declared the Crown Prince.
And the invitation is only
for the Crown Prince.
Whether you are
the Crown Prince or not
can be clarified
only by His Highness.
Yes.
After hearing this message
I can declare you
the Crown Prince, son.
Then it is time for me
to go and talk to grandsire
himself, father.
I must discharge my duties.
Then grandsire,
what is the solution?
May you live long.
There is only one solution,
dear.
Whoever takes sides
with the unrighteous
needs to be slain by you.
You need not ponder
why one is protecting
the unrighteous.
Just engage in the battle.
There is no other way now
to keep Hastinapur
safe from a battle.
If we do engage
in a battle, grandsire
then Panchali's father
will charge with his army too.
King Virat will also
take part in it.
Even the King of Gandhar
will charge with his army then.
The army of Anga
will also take part in it.
Eventually all the Kings
will take part in this battle.
In other words
it will become a war for the
entire Aryan region soon.
Millions of soldiers
will be killed
numerous women
will be left widowed
and the battlefield will
engulf the future of numerous
children in darkness grandsire.
There will be destruction
on a massive scale.
How can punishing the entire
Aryan region for our
personal insult be correct?
Had I deemed this
your personal insult
I would never have advised you
to engage in a battle.
Before sowing wheat
in the fields
the remainder of the old crops
need to be pulled out.
To establish righteousness
in the Aryan region once again
the old unrighteous ways
need to be annihilated.
Vasudev Krishna was correct.
A war is mandatory.
Vasudev had asked me
on which side I will be.
My weapons shall be
subservient to Hastinapur
but my blessings
will be for the five of you.
Go on.
Gather all the Kings
of the Aryan region
who are on your side.
Be prepared for the war.
Make your grandsire proud by
displaying unparalleled valour.
May you live long!
May you be victorious!
You let the Pandavas go,
grandsire.
Why were people
who attacked Hastinapur
not slain by you?
I had set about to protect
Hastinapur, dear
and that is precisely
what I did.
I do not attack the ones
who do not
take to arms before me.
The Pandavas have challenged
the Crown Prince of Hastinapur
to a battle.
Protecting me
is your duty,
grandsire.
And until I am alive
I shall keep discharging
that duty, Crown Prince.
However,
when I die
in the battlefield
you will have to face
your punishment.
How can you die,
grandsire?
You have been blessed
with the boon to die at will.
Do not forget
that they know
how to kill me, dear.
The day the daughter of Drupad
Shikhandini will stand before me
I will have to lay
my weapons down.
That day
all of you will have to
protect yourselves
and that day will arrive soon.
Very soon, the Pandavas
will attack with their army
and the...
And the competence
all of you take such pride in
will be put to the test as well
and that too very soon.
Indeed...
The advice to attack Hastinapur
must indeed
have been given by you,
Your Excellency Bhishma.
It is their right.
I have merely
given them my support.
In other words
you
decided on your own
to take the greatness
of Hastinapur
and destroy it,
Your Excellency Bhishma?!
If the Pandavas lose
then the prosperity
of the Kuru kingdom
will be destroyed
but even if they win
the Kuru kingdom
will be left impoverished.
Who will benefit
from this battle
Your Excellency Bhishma?
We are the unrighteous
but what about
your righteous ways?
You
broke a vow
renounced love
and betrayed the trust.
You have become the cause
of death of millions of people.
You have
tarnished life
and transformed death
into agony.
Your Excellency...
Your Excellency!
Let's go
my...
My
darlings.
For numerous years
I have hidden myself
from you, mother.
How could I face you
after being a part
of the shameful game of dice?
By standing in your waters
I have offered holy water
to Surya Dev in a manner
similar to a person
bearing a white cloth
and trying to clean
a piece of coal.
The cloth becomes dirty
but the coal
does not become clean.
I too have tarnished your name
in the game of dice, mother.
How can...
How can I attain
salvation from this dilemma?
On one hand, there were
the duties stemming from my oath
and on the other, my vow to walk
on the path of righteousness.
I have attempted to end
this dilemma today, mother.
But how could I have sown
the seed of a great war?
I have become the cause
of death of millions of people.
How can I
attain liberation
from this sin, mother?
How can I?
Son
you have attained liberation
from all your sins today.
Liberation?
How is that,
mother?
I could have averted this war
but in the greed to help
the Pandavas get justice
I have subjected
the entire Aryan region
to an exceedingly grave crisis.
How could you
have averted this war,
son Devavrat?
I could have
defeated the Pandavas.
I could have slain all of them,
mother
though that would indeed
have been a grave sin.
For all these years
my efforts to keep Duryodhan
away from the throne
would have gone in vain
but at least this war
would not have arisen, mother.
But why do you wish
to keep Duryodhan
away from
the throne, son?
Duryodhan deems the throne
a piece of property
and not a duty.
When he ascends the throne
he will unleash such a reign
of unrighteousness
that in the future
the subjects will experience
nothing but misery.
In other words, the future of
the subjects of the Aryan region
has been safeguarded
by you, son.
But what about the present?
I have filled the present
of the subjects with agony.
I can see
millions of dead people
floating on your waters.
Millions of people are scattered
in my waters in the form
of ashes every day
and it will continue to be so.
By averting a war
no one can become
immortal, son.
However,
in the future
establishing righteousness again
will become highly difficult.
In the life of man
he does not have a choice
between struggle and peace, son.
He has a choice
between less and more struggle.
This is the truth of life.
You may have
burdened the subjects with
the struggle of a great war, son
but you have curtailed
the struggles
of the forthcoming generations
today itself.
That is why, do not doubt
your decision, dear.
You have been liberated
from all your sins today.
Go on
and discharge
your duties in this war
and await
your salvation with joy.
Now, this battle has become
our duty, brother Yudhishthir.
The way a crazed horse
jumps off a cliff
along with the chariot
similarly even Duryodhan
is propelling the entire society
towards a war.
How can we stop him?
If we give up our greed
to have the empire
and decide to spend
our remaining lives in a forest
then the war can be averted.
Should we not punish them
for insulting Panchali then?
Should we allow Duryodhan to
commit more misdeeds, brother?
We are the sons of a King.
Despite living in a forest,
father had imparted to you
all the qualities
of being a good King.
How can we forsake
the society so?
But how can we
battle grandsire and Guru Drona
in the battlefield?
In both the armies
we have people who are related
to us in some way or the other.
How can we watch them die?
When grandsire had
asked us to take to arms
Arjun, you were
the first to say
that your arrows
can never be aimed at him!
Then how will you
pick up your bow?
But you never disobey
grandsire, My Lord
and even the order
to engage in this war
was his.
He cannot be dissuaded.
Just think of grandsire's
mental state, My Lord.
He must have turned his heart
to stone before asking you
to attack him.
What could have been
the reason, My Lord?
He saw his daughter-in-law
being disrobed in the court
and yet he said nothing.
The tie that had
rendered him speechless
must indeed have
given him great pain.
If he could, he would have burnt
all sinners with his mere eyes.
Can you imagine the dejection
he must have felt when his eyes
were flooded with tears?
He is not asking
for a war, My Lord.
He is asking for liberation.
Nevertheless
if all of you doubt
the decision of a war
then go to Dwaraka
and question Govind.
I have firm faith
that Govind will indeed be
on our side in the war.
Panchali is correct.
If Vasudev is willing
to take our side in this war
then we can indeed believe
that this war
is a righteous one.
Madhav.
Indra Dev
do respect the
competence of Arjun
the son born
from your blessings.
His competence has
augmented your glory.
Vasudev!
I have promised
to protect Dakshak.
And a son
must honour the promise
made by his father.
Even Arjun has made
a similar promise
to his subjects.
Why is it,
Indra Dev
that everyone respects
the feelings and promises
they make themselves
but when it comes to the
feelings and promises of others
people fail to value them?
But Vasudev
what if the promises made by
father and son are in conflict?
Whose promise holds
a greater value then?
Both.
The success of a father
bestows knowledge to his son
and that of a son
brings glory to his father.
It would be correct,
Indra Dev
if you aid Arjun
in being successful.
Are you here
to ask for help, Arjun?
One cannot ask for help
by taking to arms.
Lord Indra
I was mere demonstrating
my art and competence
to please you.
But you had shot arrows at me.
You reside everywhere,
Lord Indra.
Is there any direction in which
I can shoot the arrows
in order to please you?
What help do you
seek from me, Arjun?
Before I tell you
about the help I need
I must tell you about
my oath, Lord Indra.
We shall always protect
the serpent community.
We shall even give them an equal
opportunity to prosper with us.
The city we shall build
shall gain fame by your name.
Our grand city
will be known as Indraprastha!
I am pleased,
Arjun.
How can I help you?
Do build the city for us
which we can name after you.
Your competence
and intelligence
have pleased me
immensely, son.
I will order Vishwakarma*
"All-accomplishing, maker of all," "all doer", he is the presiding deity of all craftsmen and architects.
to begin the construction
of your city.
Bless you!
Lord Indra!
Because you love your son
today
you have forsaken me.
I take the oath
that the last heir
of your son's dynasty
shall be
killed by me!
Pardon me,
Vasudev.
Please pardon me.
I had asked Dakshak
to seek your refuge.
Mayasur
had you not created an
illusory forest for Dakshak
humans and serpents would
never have had a struggle.
You have extraordinary
talents, Mayasur.
You are like the
Vishwakarma of the ogres
but you did not
employ your skills
for the betterment of the world.
You employed it
for your selfish gains.
You are correct,
Vasudev.
I made a mistake.
Pardon me,
My Lord.
Madhav
you allowed Dakshak to go free.
I request you
to pardon him.
I allowed Dakshak to go free
only because you had
promised Indra Dev, friend
that you would
protect the serpents.
Mayasur.
Since my friend
has requested me
I shall pardon you,
Mayasur.
But whenever you are
required in the future
you must employ your skills
to our advantage.
Certainly,
Vasudev.
I promise you that.
We are alive.
Friend
pray to Agni Dev now
and ask him
to put this fire out.
Agni Dev
with your blessings
Indraprastha has been
given a new life today.
I express my
heartfelt gratitude.
You have satiated my hunger
today, son of Pandu, Arjun.
I am very pleased with you.
It is in the nature of fire
that whichever object
is subjected to it
gets purified.
By devouring the illusion
of this forest
I have purified it.
And from that illusion is made
this illusory and powerful bow
which I present to you.
Like your disposition,
this bow
is also calm,
composed
and powerful.
That is why,
this bow
shall be known as
the Gandiva Bow.
You must worship it first
in your newly established city.
This bow shall multiply
your strength immensely.
Indra Dev has
fulfilled his promise.
Look over there.
The blessing of Vishwakarma.
Your city is being built.
Indraprastha.
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!
Her Highness,
my daughter...
Where is my daughter Vrushali?
Look over there.
Who has been washed up
on the shore?
It is some woman.
Let's go.
Yes, let's go.
Oh! She is the daughter
of Vrishbhan.
It seems as though she is alive.
Let us take her to the Doctor.
Let's go.
Vrushali
are you alright?
Adhiratha?
Yes, dear.
You and Vrishbhan had
gone to Indraprastha.
Then how did you
fall into the river?
Serpents had attacked us
there, Adhiratha.
Even...
Even my father was killed!
I...
I fell into the river
while trying to save myself.
Here you go.
Drink this.
No one died,
child.
The Pandavas have
captured the serpents
and compelled them
to draw the venom out.
Your father must be alive.
Then...
Then I should return
to Indraprastha.
Adhiratha, I have to go
to Indraprastha
to my father.
I want to go there.
Certainly, dear.
Certainly.
Most of the subjects
of Hastinapur
are migrating to Indraprastha.
You may travel with any family
you are familiar with.
Yes.
- Let's go.
Let me help you with that.
- Do not forget that.
Make haste.
- Put this on the cart too.
Hey... - Be careful.
All of us will live
in the new kingdom.
All of us will live in the
kingdom of King Yudhishthir.
Yes, that's right.
Bring that along as well.
That would be useful.
Our King Yudhishthir never lies
and we wish to stand
by a truthful person.
So many people
are migrating to
Indraprastha, uncle?!
It is human nature,
my darling.
He hopes to find new joy
in the new objects he finds.
The water of the ocean
wishes to touch the sky
in the form of waves.
The water in the sky
desires to fall as rain
on the mountains.
And when rain falls
on the mountains
it rushes to meet the ocean.
When the Pandavas
were leaving with a few
of our subjects, uncle
you had said to let them go.
But now, Hastinapur
will become empty!
Is this
not an insult to father and me?!
It certainly is an insult,
my darling.
It certainly is an insult.
And it is also a major problem.
We must stop
these people from
leaving Hastinapur
my darling.
I need to meet His Highness.
Yudhishthir, you truly
are very powerful.
The blood of which dynasty
runs through your veins?
From whom did your characterless
mother conceive you?
Pray tell me.
I cannot fight you
any longer, Duryodhan.
This is a friendly competition.
And there can be no place
for anger in it.
However, you had angered me
for a moment back then.
If I raise my weapon
against you now
it will be unrighteous.
But it is not
unrighteous for me.
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Your Majesty,
Prince Duryodhan is victorious.
This ovation is the evidence
that my Duryodhan
has returned
as a unique warrior.
Was Duryodhan victorious again?
No.
This time,
only Yudhishthir was defeated.
Had you waited
a few more moments there
you could have defeated him
quite easily. - No.
Had I waited there, I would have
defeated myself quite easily.
You can call Arjun now, son.
What if Bheem defeats Duryodhan?
And the subjects get robbed
of the opportunity to see Arjun.
Bheem will not win, father.
And Arjun?
He will not even reach here.
Bheem.
Duryodhan.
While fighting Bheem...
- I need no suggestion
or advice.
The day I get defeated by him
it will be
the last day of my life.
Go on, my dear.
Go on.
Mother, I knew it all along.
Only brother Bheem can compete
against brother Duryodhan.
Now, let's see how brother Bheem
crushes brother Duryodhan's
vanity.
Kunti.
Why is the earth trembling?
Bheem has entered
the arena, sister-in-law.
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
Your Majesty, among Prince Bheem
and Prince Duryodhan
the former seems more
proficient. - Be quiet, Sanjay!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Prince Bheem!
Your majesty!
This competition will make
a mockery out of us before all.
The fear evident in the princes
is scaring the subjects.
Order this to end right now.
In other words, you mean to say
that without even giving
others the opportunity
Should I declare
Duryodhan the winner?
No, grandsire.
That would be unrighteous.
It is important to give
one chance to all the princes.
The winner will be declared
only at sunset, grandsire.
Your Majesty, Prince Duryodhan's
forehead is bleeding.
Prince Bheem has broken
a rule of the competition
your Majesty.
- Splendid.
Now, it will not be unrighteous
to declare Duryodhan the winner.
Sound the conch shells.
Stop!
Bheem, stop!
Bheem...
Bheem!
Bheem!
You have violated the rules
of the competition.
Who said I was competing,
teacher?
I have been blessed
by the great Vasuki
and I was just giving him
a taste of that boon.
And of the things that will
happen to him in the future
this was just a slice.
The glory of winning
the competition
can be garnered only by Arjun.
The winner of this competition
is Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Do not be sad, Bheem.
Someone is bound to lose
in a competition.
I am sad, brother Yudhishthir.
Upon reaching here,
I had the thought
that if I ripped
Duryodhan's head from his neck
then what would have happened.
I'd have been just disqualified
from the competition.
But you are not more intelligent
than me, brother.
Brother, I was just...
Arjun.
Premonition.
Did I not tell you, Nakul?
The premonition of victory.
That time has come.
Brother Arjun is on his way.
Now, the next to enter the arena
is Prince Arjun of the Pandavas!
All hail Prince Arjun!
Even a 'gadaa'* is useless before Arjun's arrows.
*Bludgeon.
He is neither hot-headed
like Bheem
nor is he a saint
like Yudhishthir.
The one who scared me
since the beginning
was no one but Arjun.
My dear, that problem
has been taken care of.
The doorway to the arena
that you shall construct
should collapse
at the correct time
with just one arrow.
You wish to drop that structure
of the doorway, do you not, son?
So that the doorway
collapses on Arjun?
Give me that.
Let me do it for you.
My disciple is on his way.
Arjun.
Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
- My son.
Arjun.
- All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
Brother Arjun is victorious even
before engaging in the fight.
You must be wondering, son
how he did not get
crushed under the debris.
He created a canopy
of arrows over his head.
He is Arjun.
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Arjun!
We must now resort
to deception, uncle.
When it comes to deception,
it is
successful only when one has
personal limitations, my dear.
But I do not see
his limitations.
Then what do we do now?
If you do not have
the means to win
then it is wise to accept
defeat, my dear.
A Few Days Later.
Hastinapur.
After many years,
we have been blessed
with a suitable reward for our
labour throughout the year.
And this time, we have also
had a good amount of rain.
People are obtaining
more money these days.
Hence, they are becoming
more prosperous.
No wonder they are buying grains
from us at a higher price.
Ever since the son of Pandu,
Yudhishthir
became the Crown Prince even
the Gods are pleased with him.
The ogres used to cause
nuisance near the borders
but Prince Arjun has
put an end to it.
Friend, the entire
kingdom is safe.
What more could
the subjects ask for?
Just safety and prosperity.
It's nothing but the majesty of
the Crown Prince, Yudhishthir.
You are correct.
Greetings, uncle.
May glory be yours.
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir.
Bless you.
To see the Kuru Princes
become fond of each other
gives me immense
happiness, Minister.
Had the King of Gandhar
not been in Hastinapur
I too would have
thought so, Kripacharya.
He must certainly be scheming
to disrupt Hastinapur's peace.
The spider shown in this scene
has been generated
through computer graphics.
A spider works very hard
to spin a web.
How does it aid the spider?
Have you ever thought
about it, Dusshasan?
No, uncle.
The enemy submits before it
on his own free will.
He moves slowly
towards his death.
He becomes utterly helpless.
He squirms about.
But he is
unable to do anything.
In the end
he gives up his life.
This gives one unparalleled joy,
beloved Dusshasan.
The day our enemies
decide to go to Varnavrat* themselves
*A forest, present day Barnava.
that day I too
shall experience
such contentment.
Purochan has made
all the arrangements
as per your plan.
The Pandavas will
certainly go to Varnavrat
but they will
never return, uncle.
But
what if the Pandavas refuse
to go to Varnavrat?
The Crown Prince can be given
such an order
only by His Highness.
There won't be any need
to give such an order.
Yudhishthir himself
will ask for the permission
or he will have to see
with his precious eyes
the supremacy of Hastinapur
get crumbled into dust.
I do not understand, brother.
- Dusshasan!
My beloved!
When you strike at
the flat end of a nail
the pointed end
sinks into the earth.
When it comes to the cornerstone
of righteousness in Hastinapur
your grandsire Bhishma
is like a nail's flat end
while the pointed end is
Crown Prince Yudhishthir.
If you strike at your grandsire
then Yudhishthir will be
forced to sink into the earth.
Insult that old geyser
and keep at it,
my beloved nephews!
That is our plan's second stage.
And the first stage
of this insult
involves Dushala's marriage.
Sukta, I was awaiting you.
You are my eyes.
Just look at these ornaments.
Aren't they beautiful?
I had these made for
Dushala's 'swayamvar.
Swayamvar?
Princess Dushala cannot have
a 'swayamvar,' Her Highness.
Why?
Do you not know?
Everyone in the palace
is discussing this.
Prince Duryodhan has announced
Princess Dushala's marriage
to Jayadratha,
the King of Sindhu.
How can that be possible?
Sindhu has had enmity
with Hastinapur for ages.
His Highness and uncle Bhishma
will never agree to it.
That is impossible,
brother Duryodhan.
Dushala cannot be married to
Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu.
Without even seeking permission
how could you propose this
marriage to the King of Sindhu?
The decision to have
my sister married
is my personal matter.
Mulling over Princess Dushala's
marriage and its consequences
is the duty of the Ministers,
Prince Duryodhan.
You are well aware
that only those kings are
invited to a 'swayamvar
with whom forming
personal relationships
does not adversely
affect the kingdom.
I do not wish to turn
my sister's marriage
into politics, Minister.
Prince Duryodhan
we shall forge no relationship
with either Magadha or Sindhu.
And this has always been
the policy of our kingdom.
The duty of carrying out
the policies of the kingdom
is that of brother Yudhishthir.
He is the Crown Prince.
Not me.
To me,
the happiness of my sister
is above all else.
Princess Dushala
is not only your sister
but also the daughter
of His Highness.
Water is water
whether is it found
in a river or a pitcher.
However, only river water
is worshipped
and not the water in a pitcher.
The values and duties
of a person
are determined
based on his rank.
It is essential
to have a Princess
married through the mode
of a 'swayamvar.
Sage Vashishtha was married
to the Princess of Vidarbha,
Lopamudra, Bhishma
because it was Lopamudra's wish.
Then why can't beloved Dushala
marry the King of Sindhu
out of her free will?
But of course
you have always used
your sense of duty
to crush the desires and wishes
of everyone around you.
- King of Gandhar!
Watch what you are saying.
Insulting grandsire
was not uncle's intentions,
uncle Vidur.
The sense of duty
is the most supreme
and toughest in the world.
But we ordinary people
cannot execute such
a tough task, Minister.
The Prince is correct, Minister.
The Lord of Sun burns himself
in order to
illuminate the world.
The moon does not have
the power to burn.
Hence, it cannot
illuminate the earth.
It can only provide coolness.
A person who did not marry
cannot be expected to
understand the affection
for one's family.
A person who did not marry
cannot be expected to
understand the affection
for one's family.
I did not get married
because the sons and
grandsons of my brother
are my family, King of Gandhar.
And King Dhritarashtra knows it.
The heart pumps blood
through the body.
And the heart beats
because of the blood.
The way the heart and the blood
cannot be separated.
Similarly
the progeny of the Kuru dynasty
and I are not different.
King of Gandhar
do remember.
The sense of duty is borne of
affection and compassion.
And Prince Duryodhan
it is the love of the Sun God
that makes him burn himself in
order to illuminate the world.
Indeed, uncle Vidur.
But it is also true
that the light of the sun
gives birth to vegetation
while that of the moon
gives birth to herbs.
In other words
that which is valuable
stems from the sense of duty
or love?
Brother Duryodhan
there is no point
to a discussion now.
Grandsire has said that
Dushala will have a 'swayamvar
and his words are
like an order to us!
It may be an order
to you, Crown Prince
and to the Ministers of the
royal court of Hastinapur
but not to me.
The truth is, we have
a major dilemma at hand.
But it is not a dilemma for me
because I am
not the Crown Prince.
It is a dilemma for you
but I am the son
of His Highness!
You cannot curtail
any of my actions.
But I can curtail your actions.
A waterfall erodes the earth.
The earth can never be
an obstacle to a waterfall.
Grandsire.
Beloved Yudhishthir
once, Goddess Parvati had closed
Lord Shiva's eyes
out of playfulness.
And at that moment
the entire creation had
plunged into darkness.
And from that darkness
was born a demon called Andhak.
And he began tormenting
the entire creation.
It was a grim situation
for the Gods.
The son of Lord Shiva
and Goddess Parvati
could be killed only by
Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.
We are in a similar situation.
Back then, Lord Shiva had
salvaged the world, grandsire.
Dhritarashtra cannot
curtail his son's actions.
Or maybe
he does not have
the desire to do so.
There is only one solution
to this situation, grandsire.
You must take a decision,
grandsire.
You must ask me to step down
as the Crown Prince
and declare Duryodhan
as the new Crown Prince.
Otherwise he will
keep doing such things.
He will approach the Kings
who are not the allies of Kuru
and befriend them.
And he will forge an enmity
with the Kings
who are our allies.
He will keep posing such
problems for us, grandsire.
Are you scared of
such problems, Yudhishthir?
I did not expect this from you.
Your insult scares me,
grandsire.
And Duryodhan will
keep posing situations
where you will be insulted.
And do you believe, you stepping
down as the Crown Prince
will add to my respect?
Yudhishthir
I had promised my father
that until the kingdom
of Hastinapur
would find a righteous
and brave king
I would continue
this struggle of mine.
And if
you step down
as the Crown Prince
and despite your presence
I have to declare Duryodhan
as the Crown Prince
then my promise
will go unfulfilled.
My lifelong struggle
will go in vain.
And this...
This will be
the biggest insult to me.
Until you are alive
you cannot forsake Hastinapur.
Please
marry my eldest brother.
By presiding over
the throne of Hastinapur
please work for the welfare
of its subjects.
Your radiance
and your glory
will illuminate the entire
Aryan region in the future.
What about you, Prince?
We four brothers
will resort to asceticism.
Out of the five brothers,
four must resort to asceticism.
In this strange situation
we five brothers
cannot coexist together.
Is this the solution you
came up with in this situation
Prince Arjun?
In other words, you will give
the fruit of your competence
to someone else as charity.
Did King Karna of Anga
not wish to do the same?
But he was prohibited to do so.
Then how can you
have the right to do so?
And what about
my honour, Prince?
The world will laugh at me
that when I found out
that only the eldest son
has the right to the throne
I decided to deem
someone else my husband.
What am I, Prince?
A woman who loves a man
only for property?
When a tree burns
the climber wrapped around it
also burns to ashes.
It does not change its basis.
Am I inferior
to even that climber?
If you agree with me
then it shall not be deemed
your selfishness
but sacrifice, Princess.
No one will speak ill of you.
Prince even Goddess Sita
was spoken ill of.
Then how can I be spared?
Then answer this question
of mine, Prince.
I will make the sacrifice.
You will make the sacrifice.
Three of your brothers
will make the sacrifice.
Will the burden
of so many sacrifices
let your eldest brother live?
Then, Princess
you should return
to your father.
Invalidate the 'swayamvar.
You have the right to do so.
- And after that...
Who will marry me?
I have heard the tale of Amba,
the Princess of Kashi, Prince.
Should I also follow her path
and go beg before Kings
and ask for justice?
And in the end
the fire of dejection
will burn me to ashes.
Has the royal family
of Hastinapur
taken an oath to torch
the maidens of the Aryan region
Prince?!
Pardon me, Princess.
If the four brothers of mine
resort to asceticism
because of me
then its burden
will crush our married life.
I see no solution
to this situation.
Pardon us.
These five stones...
These are the fives bases
of righteousness, Draupadi.
There are many instances
in one's life, Draupadi
when one is unable
to see the path.
In order to remind
oneself of righteousness
one requires an object.
The decision will always
be yours, Draupadi.
But taking a decision bearing
righteousness in mind
will be easier.
We cannot let this injustice
happen to Princess Draupadi
mother.
We must face
the punishment for it.
Lady.
Draupadi.
Dear, my sons have found
a way out of this situation.
You will not face
any form of injustice.
You and Arjun will get married.
But before that
the rest of my sons
will resort to asceticism.
Asceticism is the
path of courage, lady.
It is not a refuge when
running away from problems.
Who will benefit from
the asceticism of your sons?
And Prince Bheem is married.
Why should his first wife
be punished so?
There is no other
solution, dear.
When a woman gets married
she enters her new home
with the hope to become
that family's good fortune.
How can I bring misfortune
to King Pandu's
family and his lineage, lady?
Unknowingly, you
have divided me
amongst your five sons.
I deem your mistake
my destiny.
I...
I will marry your five sons.
I will marry your five sons.
Impossible.
- Impossible!
What did you say, Draupadi?
Have these 'Brahmins
planned to divide you?
How did such a terrible thought
stem in their minds?!
Is this the competence
of this 'Brahmin?!
The divinely fragrant
sandalwood tree
is home to venomous serpents!
I had heard of such a thing!
Today, I have seen it myself!
We have no such plan,
Your Highness.
Pardon us.
Fate worked in such...
- Be quiet, 'Brahmin!
Otherwise I shall lose the fear
of killing a 'Brahmin.
The royal family of Panchal
shall protect its Princess.
I do not accept this marriage.
Let's go, daughter.
Father
if a maiden won in a 'swayamvar
stays with her father
then you will be humiliated.
And so will I.
That will not be humiliation
but the blessing
of Lord Surya himself.
Daughter, one would have
been humiliated
had his daughter not been
welcomed in his home.
How did this happen, sons?
How could I commit
such a grave mistake?
I have ruined a maiden's life
by giving her lifelong insult.
Joy, sorrow, respect, insult
life and death.
If you can give all this, Kunti
then what does the Almighty do?
Lord Vedvyas!
Greetings.
Greetings.
There would come
a time in your lives
when you would not know
what the righteous path is.
I knew of it.
That is why
I have come here
from Kampilya, Kunti.
Lord Vedvyas
greetings.
No one knows more about
righteousness than you
in the entire world.
You have classified the 'Vedas
into four segments.
Oh Great Sage, answer us.
What would be correct and
appropriate in this situation?
Your name is Yudhishthir.
It means being steady
in testing times.
Being steady in testing times
is in your nature, child.
Then how can you
be so perturbed?
When life is spinning
out of control
it is essential
to calm oneself down.
Let's meditate
over this situation.
And
what about
the five sons of mine?
Govind!
Will they...
Will they d-die as well?
Govind
I beg of you!
Please give me
a definite answer this time.
Tell me, Govind!
What will be
the outcome of the war?
I want to know, Govind!
Tell me.
A war always brings
destruction, Panchali.
Nothing but agony and suffering
are born in the battlefield.
How could you think, there
would be joy for you in it?
Yes.
Apart from the five
husbands of yours
the entire lineage
of King Shantanu
will be destroyed.
The entire dynasty will be
annihilated in this war.
Govind
will King Pandu's entire dynasty
be sacrificed in this war?
My children...
During times of struggle
their mere thought would
give us the strength we needed.
Their birth had given us...
Had given us a new life.
Will they die?
In other words
the war we are preparing for
with such zeal
and fervour, Govind
is like a preparation...
Like a preparation
for sending our children to die?
There is not a moment
in a man's life
when he is not walking
towards death, friend.
The truth is,
are all his activities
not aimed at dying?
Is each leaf born during spring
not meant to fall off
during the fall?
Is its birth
absorbing the rays of the sun
and producing a melody
while swaying in the wind
utterly worthless?
When a tornado shakes up a tree
each leaf of that tree
tries its very best
to hold onto it.
And when the leaves turn yellow
they fall off gladly.
The creation is also
like a great tree, friend.
And every human being,
flora and fauna is a leaf
which grows and then falls off
that tree.
Their falling off is certain
but until they are on the tree
it is vital for them
to experience both
struggle and peace.
I see no upside to this,
Govind.
Because you are bound
by attachment, friend.
Yes!
I am bound by attachment,
Govind.
And even if we emerge
victorious in this war
it will give me no joy.
When did I say that you would
get joy out of this war, friend?
When did I advise you to fight
to seek revenge,
respect and property?
This war
is for the joy
of the society, friend.
In order to put an end
to unrighteousness
and to establish
righteousness again
we must fight this war,
friend.
Why should such a big sacrifice
be made by us,
Govind?
Why?
Listen, friend.
In a society, man must abide by
rules, ideals and righteousness.
These three entities are like
sand castles
built on the sea-shore.
The waves of time
keep breaking them constantly.
They need to be
built time and again
otherwise
rules, ideals and righteousness
get annihilated.
The Almighty gives
very few the strength
needed to establish
righteousness again.
And even after sacrificing
everything they have
the people who have
this strength
end up struggling
for righteousness.
Be it Lord Ram
Lord Parashuram
or the Vaman Avatar of Vishnu
this world reveres only those
who struggle towards
establishing righteousness.
You must understand,
friend
that struggling
for righteousness
is not a duty
but a decision
and a vow.
Similarly, for you,
this war
is not a duty.
It is a vow
taken for the society.
You may break this vow
whenever you want.
You might
just be blessed with the joy
of children, husbands
and grandchildren
but like millions of people
you too will be lost
in the sands of time, friend.
Your life will become worthless.
Because of you
no one will benefit anything.
The Almighty who has
given you special powers
will lose His faith in you.
The decision
is yours, friend.
Sister-in-law!
Come here.
Sister-in-law
here we have a coconut, a hair
ornament and a wedding dress.
We need to present
all this to Uttara.
Let's go.
Sister-in-law
please come.
Sister-in-law
place your hand on this.
Apart from the five
husbands of yours
the entire lineage
of King Shantanu
will be destroyed.
The entire dynasty will be
annihilated in this war.
Sons
can someone tell me
how these 'laddoos
can be consumed
without folding the arm?
Our sons have reminded us
of our childhood.
You are correct,
brother Bheem.
And after a few years
their children will remind them
of their childhood.
In other words, our sons
have immortalised us.
Mother Draupadi...
Mother Draupadi.
Mother?
Please tell us
how we can eat
without folding our arms.
Please tell us, mother.
Please come.
Come with me.
Come.
Be seated.
Tell us,
Mother Draupadi.
How do we eat
without folding our arms?
What decision
have you taken, friend?
Govind
a sapling planted by a person
cannot be pulled out by him.
How will I be able
to see my sons die?
In the court of Hastinapur,
a woman was insulted
but she tolerated it.
But a mother will not be able to
tolerate her sons getting slain
Govind.
A wife tolerated
the loss of property
of her husbands
but a mother will not be able to
tolerate the death of her sons
Govind.
No.
I am willing
to forget all the insults,
Govind.
This property,
the empire...
I am willing to give up
all of it, Govind.
But no...
I cannot send my sons
to the battlefield.
No.
No, Govind.
I do not want a war.
I will certainly emerge
victorious in this battle.
I will become the emperor
of all the kingdoms.
After me, my son Laxman...*
*"Auspicious."
After him, his son
will become the emperor.
If the last survivor
of the Pandavas' lineage
is being nurtured
in anyone's womb
he will be killed,
before he is even born.
Listen carefully, mother.
I will die and the five Pandavas
will survive...
Don't you even think
of such a scenario.
Until I receive the news
of the death
of those five brothers
my soul will not leave my body.
It won't.
I take that vow!
The King of Panchal Dhrupad,
Commander Shikhandini
and Prince Dhrishtadyumna
are entering!
Stay blessed.
Stay blessed.
Father
where are my sons?
Can a child stay away
from his mother's love?
Mother, my life revolves
around the inspiration
of my father Yudhisthir's
righteousness.
Bless me
that in the coming battle
I am able to live up
to everyone's expectations.
Prativindhya
*Prativindya means Drupadi's son. Other name: Shrutavindha "related to the Buddhi (righteousness)."
may you have a very long life.
Greetings, mother.
I am the heir to my father
Bheem's strength.
Bless me, mother
so that I am able to crush
the heads of my enemies.
So be it, Sutasom.*
"Manifestation of the mind", because he was born after Bhima had performed a thousand Soma** sacrifices.)**A Vedic ritual drink, juice extract of Ephedra sinica stalk.
Mother, bless me so that I can
make my father Arjun's powers
my achievements.
Every arrow you shoot
will be reinforced with my blessings, Sutakarma.*
*Action taken by his son.
May you have a very long life.
Mother, bless me so
that I become as effective
as the sharp sword
of my father Nakul
against our enemies.
Satanika*
*Named after a famous king in the Kuru lineage who had that name and he was considered to be an avatar of Visvadevas (various Vedic gods).
all your ambitions
will be fulfilled.
You have my blessings.
Mother, bless me
so that like my father Sahadev
even my insight always
helps our side.
Srutasena,* it will certainly be so.
*With a famous army.
You will always
have my blessings.
Mother
we will face every attack
meant for our fathers.
You are my sons.
You are impossible to defeat
on the battlefield.
And I will act
as my brothers' shield.
Give me such a blessing.
May you be immortal,
Abhimanyu.
Go.
Take blessings from
your fathers.
Your Majesty
Uttara is fortunate
that she is getting married
to Prince Abhimanyu.
When Uttara's son
will rule Indraprastha
sitting on the royal throne
he will be protected
by five uncles.
Abhimanyu's son?
The greatest of the Yadavs,
Krishna, has promised me
that Uttara will give birth
to the emperor who will
rule over the entire nation.
Abhimanyu will be the reason
behind the change of an epoch
and his son
will take the first step
towards that change.
Govind.
Govind
what is going to happen
in the battle
between the Kauravas
and the Pandavas?
I need to know.
Why such a question suddenly,
my friend?
In this battle, Bheem and Arjun
shall fulfil their oaths.
Sinners shall be punished.
Righteousness shall win.
Who all will die, Govind?
Who all will survive?
Who can know the result
of a battle?
You can.
Tell me.
Why did the sacred thread
tied by me, break?
You said that Abhimanyu shall
be the reason behind the change
but his son will take the first
step towards that change.
You said that Abhimanyu's son
shall be the ruler of the nation
But my elder son Prativindhya
has the foremost right
to the throne of Hastinapur.
Why will his son
not become the emperor?
Why will Abhimanyu
not become the emperor himself?
There is some deep meaning
in your words, Govind.
But I want a clear answer.
The sorrow of the future destroys
the joys of the present.
The joys of the future
cannot erase
the grief of the future.
Don't try to know the future.
It won't help you
in any manner.
Learn to live in the present.
Perform your duties.
And don't try to find out the
Almighty's plans for the future.
That means...
Will Abhimanyu
die?
And my five sons...
Govind!
Will they also...
Will they die as well?
In this war whoever
is a hurdle to punishing
the sons of Dhritarashtra
must be slain!
Perhaps slaying Grandsire
isn't inevitable, Krishna.
Today he disarmed our eldest brother
but did not slay him.
Therefore, in this battle of justice
even Grandsire hopes for our victory.
And until he does not
interfere in our path to victory
slaying him isn't inevitable.
And just like today
even tomorrow
we shall reach Prince Duryodhan.
It's not just battles, Arjun
but every moment of life
gives us new experiences.
Those who plan based on past
experiences are disappointed.
If Grandsire's situations
and thoughts undergo a change
we should not face disappointment.
Greetings, Grandsire!
If you feel well, shall we
decide about strategies
for tomorrow.
With the help of a miracle
a person may
perhaps keep a lamp's flame lit
and stable amidst strong wind.
But if the wick of the lamp is dampened
its flame cannot be kept lit and stable.
Even the wick of my soul
is drenched with tears.
The very Yudhishtir, to see whom
upon the throne of Hastinapur
I enslaved myself to the
throne of Hastinapur forever
today...
Today I had to enslave
that Yudhishtir himself.
How can I feel well, Master Drona
in this battlefield?
But...
But battle plans and strategies
need to be discussed.
Have a seat.
What is your advice, Master Drona?
There exists a very
common battle formation.
Garland formation!
With this we can distribute
our army into smaller clusters
and make an attack.
No, Master Drona!
With this battle formation
we cannot supervise the activity
of the entire army.
Ought to this
either one of the sons
of Dhritarashtra may die
or one of the sons of Pandu could die.
Until my last breath I cannot bear
the burden of the death of
my children and grandchildren.
Therefore, today
on the battlefield
I captivated Yudhishtir.
I did not slay him.
I could not slay him,
Master Drona.
I could not.
In this battle
I have a single goal, Master Drona.
I cannot let anyone
among the Kuru clan die.
We must soon arrest Yudhishtir
and put an end to this war!
Prince!
What is the motive behind
summoning all these warriors?
Dear friend Karna, brace yourself.
Tomorrow at dawn you shall
be present at the battlefield
and exhibit your skill!
I believe you
won't break my trust.
My lad...
- Be quiet!
Be quiet, uncle!
Your advice has already
caused me enough damage!
It was your advice to yield to
Grandsire Bheeshma's insistence
and not to let my friend
Karna enter the battlefield.
What was the result of that?
Today you may have witnessed
that Grandsire Bheeshma stays
at the midst of our army
but fights on behalf of the enemy!
Prince, had you and your brothers
not been under my protection
all of you would perish
on the very first day of battle.
Honour is worthier than one's life.
And honour is measured
by trust, Grandsire.
You have broken my trust
and strangulated my honour!
You killed not just my honour
but the honour of all of Hastinapur.
You have brought shame upon
the name of King Shantanu!
Prince Duryodhan!
Had I not sworn to protect you
I would slay you right now!
Then raise your weapon!
Let's engage in a duel,
Grandsire Bheeshma!
The embracer of justice
and the son of Ganga!
Let us test today
as to how mighty
these treacherous arms are!
He had the chance
to slay Yudhishtir!
But he did not do that!
Had you slain Yudhishtir
the battle would end today,
Grandsire!
Shame on you!
Friend Karna!
I order you
as the King of Hastinapur.
Tomorrow you shall
enter the battlefield!
You are aware of my
decision as well, Duryodhan.
If your friend Karna even steps
onto the battlefield tomorrow
I shall not fight this battle!
In that case, do no fight the battle.
Your presence on the battlefield
makes no difference to me.
In fact, if you are not
present on the battlefield
I shall attain victory
even more easily.
Now I do not need you.
Duryodhan!
A necklace is held worthy
only when it has pearls in it
and is assumed respectable too!
If a pearl falls off a
necklace it becomes worthless!
Master Drona,
before storming at me
think of what is just yourself!
Grandsire Bheeshma!
Even you better ponder upon your duties!
You have embraced the pride
of being just all your life!
Now tell me, where is your justice?
You had sworn to guard
the throne of Hastinapur!
If today, you renounce the battlefield
what about that oath of
yours, Grandsire Bheeshma?
I will spend my life
not as the King of Hastinapur
but as a servant to it!
Until you are seated upon the
throne of Hastinapur as King
until then I shall be a
servant to you and Hastinapur
and abide by your every order!
Yes, Grandsire Bheeshma!
Under any circumstance
you have no rights at all
to renounce the battlefield!
Whether my friend Karna fights or not
you shall have to fight this battle!
Yes, Grandsire Bheeshma!
Think deeply!
You are in a huge moral dilemma!
You decide, Grandsire
as to which one out of your two pledges
would you like to fulfill!
Will you defend Hastinapur
or renounce the battlefield upon
seeing Karna enter the battle?
Ponder over it, Grandsire.
Do you wish to renounce your duty
and perish like a pest
in the dirt
or embrace your duty
and justify your death?
My decision is my friend Karna...
- Wait, friend!
Do not insult Grandsire
in this manner.
I have utmost faith
that Grandsire shall
not break your trust.
Let him fight the battle!
Moreover, I am always at your disposal
ready to lay down my life!
My lad!
The armoured one speaks wisely!
Duryodhan, my lad,
have mercy on Grandsire.
Any aged one's death should
not be meddled with, lad.
Very well, if you all insist
I can give him one chance.
But what shall I gain from it?
I solemnly swear
that until my death
I shall not renounce the battlefield.
Every moment, I shall stand
on the battlefield.
The way ought to Lord Shiva's fiery 'Rudra Tandav'*
*A divine dance of Shiva that depicts his violent nature.
the entire world was
plunged into darkness
similarly
I will erase all hope of victory
from the enemy's heart!
I shall obliterate
the entire army of the enemy!
Why do the winds
seem so strong, Krishna?
These are the winds of change, Draupadi!
Someone's circumstances
have undergone a change.
Mindsets have changed.
And now situations
shall change as well.
Would this change
become the reason of
our sorrow, O' Krishna?
Change does not bring
about sorrow, good lady
but it does bring about pain.
Therefore a human
always fears change.
He tries to oppose it.
But, good lady
change is the law of nature!
And joy...
Joy is a product of creation.
That implies, no matter
what pain change cause to one
in the end he does find joy.
Some feel the joy of success
while some feel
the joy of liberation.
Grandsire!
What formation do we assume
for tomorrow's battle?
What is the strategy?
Strategy?
There is just one strategy,
Master Drona?
The strategy to unleash rivers of blood!
Tomorrow I shall be at the
forefront of the army
and unleash chaos!
Witnessing the agony in your heart
I feel immensely sad.
But Grandsire,
you are abiding by duty.
But when it is time
to abide by one's duty
that time it is inappropriate
to express any grief
nor any affection.
I know, Master Drona!
Living up to the promise
made to my father is my duty.
Tomorrow, at dawn when I
shall enter the battlefield
love, affection, sacrifice,
hatred, pain, sorrow...
I shall renounce all of these!
My hands shall wield a bow
and the burden of duty
shall be over my head.
This battlefield
shall devour all possibilities
of a just kingdom.
All lights of Hastinapur
shall be extinguished by me.
But I...
I shall not mourn for it, Master Drona!
Just one night!
All the sorrows in my heart
shall crush all my feelings
by the end of this night
and tomorrow, at dawn
I shall step
onto the battlefield
like a heartless beast
driven solely by thirst for blood!
I have lost all my pride.
So, I quit the game.
Emperor Yudhishthir
you are the supreme Emperor.
Hastinapur has taken your refuge
and I am the commander-in-chief
of Hastinapur.
In other words
your words are my command.
Just
order me to release
your younger brothers
and I shall have them freed,
immediately.
And if
you order me to punish anyone
then even that order shall be
executed immediately.
Your Highness...
Your Highness,
I have been defeated.
I have been defeated!
Despite winning the game of dice
I have lost the game of life,
Your Highness.
I have lost the game of life.
Now, I shall accept
any punishment you award me.
You shall not be punished,
uncle.
I pardon you
and brother Duryodhan.
How, Your Highness?
How?
How can you have
such a pardoning heart?
What is the force
that keeps your heart so steady?
Life is nothing
but a war,
Your Highness
and in this war called life
you always remain steady.
How, Your Highness?
How?
Irradiate the way of an ignorant
person like me, Your Highness.
Get up,
King of Gandhar.
It is a simple path,
King of Gandhar.
Everyone knows about
righteousness and truth
and I have never renounced
either of the two.
This is what leaves me
contented.
Contentment?
No, Your Highness.
We do not want contentment.
I
Crown Prince Duryodhan
and King Ashwatthama
do not want contentment,
Your Highness.
We do not want contentment.
We want the society
to look at us
and put its hands together
to treat us with honour
and respect us.
A beggar has his gaze
fixed on the sacrament,
Your Highness
and not on the idol
of the Almighty.
We are destitute from our souls,
Your Highness.
From our souls...
We are not looking
for contentment
but pride and honour instead.
But Your Highness
how can
being righteous be something
to take pride in?
How?
Righteousness is the driver
of actions, King of Gandhar.
One who has not
renounced righteousness
nor given up being truthful
requires nobody's approval
to take pride in oneself.
Mango is sweet by nature,
King of Gandhar.
It does not require sugar.
Your Highness
you never lie, do you?
Despite facing
numerous challenges
you did not renounce
righteousness.
Despite losing all your brothers
you stood by truthfulness.
Since you are a righteous man
with a heart filled
with righteousness
you take pride in yourself
because the truth is
there is no greater pride
than righteousness
in the entire world!
You are correct,
King of Gandhar.
But brother Yudhishthir
you had told brother Bheem that
you were ashamed of yourself
and that there was
no pride in losing us.
Absolutely, Nakul
but a human heart
is not all that simple.
I have never renounced
righteousness
and I take pride in it.
Then be seated,
Your Highness.
The game of dice
has not concluded yet.
Brother...
May the Emperor be happy!
Now, I shall bet
myself against you,
in this round.
May the Empress be happy.
What happened,
maid?
The Emperor has
bet himself this time
and I am afraid
that he will be defeated.
What kind of a treachery
is this?
When a tree
is struck with lightning
the top of the tree
is the first to burn.
Why are men on key positions,
like grandsire and Guru Drona
not getting burnt
with wrath, there?
Why is no one saying anything?
May the Empress be happy.
Vrushali
you...
Your Highness
I... I request you
to leave with the accompanying
army of Indraprastha
to the city of Ahichhatra,* immediately.
*The ancient capital of Northern Panchala taken over by Drona, near Ramnagar village in Uttar Pradesh state. Ahi means snake or Naga (serpent worshippers), khsetra means region.
Your brother Dhrishtadyumna
will certainly
protect you there.
Protect me?
You are a fool!
I am aware of the environment
prevailing here, Your Highness.
All this treachery
is intended to insult you.
If the Emperor gets defeated
then you shall
require protection.
Despite having the five most
competent Aryan warriors
as my husbands
will I have to seek
the protection of my brother?
Pardon me,
Your Highness
but pride defines competence.
When one loses one's pride
how can he be competent?
Uncle!
Slave, take that crown off!
And a slave
does not have the right
to grace a throne of gold.
I am the Lord of Indraprastha!
Now, the supreme Emperor
of the Aryan region
is me!
Me!
Attendant
go to the wife
of these five slaves
and order her to present
herself here!
Go to the wife
of these five slaves
and order her to present
herself here!
Impossible!
If Panchali is
insulted in this court
then there will be
a bloodbath here!
Bheem has
already broken his mace,
slave Arjun
and your Gandiva
belongs to King Karna of Anga.
Then what bloodshed?
Duryodhan!
There are only
two duties in my life!
First is to protect my family
and the other is to obey the
orders of brother Yudhishthir!
So, in order for
a bloodbath to take place
these hands of mine
are more than adequate!
Calm down,
Bheem.
Duryodhan!
A person being enslaved
certainly does not imply
that everyone has
the right to his wife.
This is Hastinapur
and justice reigns supreme here!
Draupadi is the daughter
of my friend.
She is like a daughter to me.
Do not insult her,
Duryodhan
else, with my presence here
for her protection
she need not await the arrival
of anyone from Ahichhatra.
We shall certainly
not insult the Empress.
We shall certainly not do that,
Great Guru Drona.
My darling
do not be foolish.
Had the mere defeat
of Yudhishthir
given you the right
to his family
there would have been no need
to defeat the five brothers
individually, in the game.
We could have defeated
Yudhishthir in the first round.
Right?
You do not have the right
over the Empress, yet.
For that
you'll have to win the Empress
in the game of dice!
If the society learns
that you bore Karna before
you got married
no one would respect him.
But instead your five sons
would be mocked at.
I do not wish to consider that!
I do not care for anyone!
When he'd have cried as a child
which mother would have
wiped his tears!
I have to wipe the stains
of all his old tears.
I want to run my hands
through my Karna's hair
and pacify him.
Beyond a mother's lap
there exists no childhood,
Priyamvada.
None at all.
Mother, childhood doesn't exist
beyond a mother's lap.
There exists no life.
Even after I get crowned
you'd let me rest my head
in your lap, right?
Dear, you must remove the crown
and place your head on my lap
or it will prick me.
Mother
aren't you happy
about my coronation ceremony?
A person's happiness
is as per his capability.
The coronation, the palace
are beyond me.
The only thing I am happy about
that after several years
the visage of my son radiates
satisfaction and pride.
Radha, take a long look
at this radiance.
It will be soon surrounded by
the dark clouds of regret.
People would say that
the greed to attain pride
provided a lifelong slur
to Karna.
I didn't understand, father.
A gem lying in the coals
is considered as coal, son.
By befriending
King Dhritrashtra's sons
you wouldn't attain respect.
Injustice and humiliation
are but two faces of a coin.
When I had entered the ground
I wasn't friends with anyone.
Was I respected then?
- How would you have been?
You had no place on the ground.
When it comes
to a test of capabilities
every capable person
has a deserving place.
There should be!
Caste and creed are considered
as proof of power and
capabilities by this society.
Wouldn't it become weak
having lost those powers?
But only Prince Duryodhan
realised the truth.
Dhritrashtra's son
displayed that generosity.
He surely has selfish motives.
- He may.
A 'yajna' aimed
at attaining something from God
is still a 'yajna', father.
It's not our duty to think about
Prince Duryodhan's motives.
To accept his favours
and offer love and dedication
in lieu is our duty, father.
Karna, the scriptures say
that charity and favour
if received from good men only
are worth accepting.
But I assume that you
are so disappointed
that you cannot see
righteousness.
Go, son
Fulfill your duties. 
Wouldn't you accompany
me, father?
How would I live without
you, mother?
Wouldn't you accompany me?
No, son.
We will stay here.
Someday when you need a house
which has never been
overshadowed by unrighteousness
you must have
a house to return to.
We will keep your house
away from misdeeds, Karna.
You must leave, son.
May you prosper.
Wouldn't you place the crown on
your son's head, mother?
So that its weight reminds me
of what have I lost in my life.
Son.
Son!
A relationship
that is tantamount to a duty
isn't up for choices,
Priyamvada.
I have to now go to my son.
Princess.
Princess, before you leave
you must promise me
that unless you do not
meet Karna
you wouldn't speak anything
about Karna to your five sons.
For the sake of a friend
you must make a promise,
Princess.
Only then would I let you go.
Just give me the promise.
Bheem?
- I am kidnapping you, mother
as I will be the first to
touch your feet.
But to touch her feet, you have
to place her on the ground.
Greetings mother.
Mother.
On seeing all of you
in the ground
I was so elated.
Sahadev
since when have you
become so competent, son?
And what about me?
When the ground trembled at
the blow of your mace
my trembling heart
became stable.
My Bheem.
- But
we were defeated.
I do not know that
but today
you have made your
mother victorious, sons.
Arjun, today all the ancestors
would be showering flowers
on your father.
It means
a bow is the supreme weapon.
I had said that
to brother Bheem.
Arjun, the bow is
perfect for you
and a mace is perfect for Bheem.
How are you, mother?
On our way, we had learned that
you had fainted.
How is your health now, mother?
Yes, actually
at the ground
when...
When I...
- ...saw two archers in a duel
the love for her son made
the Princess fall weak.
She is my childhood friend
Priyamvada.
Greetings!
- Greetings.
Greetings.
I advised the Princess
that when she has
five capable sons
then why should she
be weak at heart?
Priyamvada, it's
a mother's heart.
When a competition
turns out to be a war
between the brothers...
Mother, we are the Pandavas
and they are a hundred Kauravas.
When they do not consider
us as brothers
why should we then be
affectionate towards them?
We are five of us
and are enough for each other.
Mother
we five brothers are like
the five fingers of a hand.
We neither need an extra brother
nor one less would
be sufficient.
And our brother Bheem
is the thumb.
That means if us four
brothers apply ashes on someone
brother Bheem will
do a tilak
and conclude the task.
That was said by Nakul.
Brother.
Sahadev, you have made me happy.
I am sure mother has
made 'laddoos' for me.
I will surely give you
one of those.
No, Bheem.
Now is not the time to eat.
Grandsire, the king
and uncle Vidur
are yet to be met with.
Mother
allow us to leave.
Princess, you must
think once again.
Please keep quiet, Priyamvada.
I have agreed to whatever
you said.
I haven't spoken to my sons
about Karna yet.
Now, please let me go
and meet Karna.
I will not let this 'yajna
get completed at any cost.
Krishna's plan will fail.
And if you are able to do that,
Crown Prince Shishupal
then I shall use my mace
to protect you.
I give you my word.
Weak and foolish people like you
are of no use to me,
Duryodhan.
I can be slain
only by the person
who had taken my additional arms
and third eye from me.
In other words,
Krishna.
But he will not kill me
because my mother
had made him promise
that he will pardon
100 misdeeds of mine.
Nevertheless, knowing that
you are on my side
has left me exceedingly pleased.
The fishes shown in this scene
have been generated
using computer graphics.
The ritual is now complete.
You may be seated
on the throne now
and then distribute
the offertory to the guests.
After you are done with it
we will proceed
to the next phase
in which four
representative Kings
will build a canopy
on your throne.
Only then will you be declared
the supreme Emperor.
Bless you!
Revered guests
our mother had taken the oath
that only after the city
of her sons becomes independent
will she enter Indraprastha.
Hence, we were compelled
to engage in labour
and demonstrate our valour.
Because of the teachings
of our revered grandsire Bhishma
we have been successful
in this endeavour.
Only after seeking the blessings
of both these people
will I have the right
to be seated on the throne.
I welcome mother and grandsire
to this gathering!
All hail His Excellency Bhishma!
All hail His Excellency Bhishma!
All hail Queen Mother Kunti!
All hail Queen Mother Kunti!
All hail His Excellency Bhishma!
May you live long!
Greetings, grandsire.
Greetings, grandsire.
Bless you all!
Seeing this city of yours
has made me very proud.
Give your mother Kunti
a grand welcome
and have her seated at
the highest place in the court.
I have been a witness
to her struggles.
All of you
are reaping the rewards
of her struggles.
Bless you!
Get up,
Yudhishthir.
Apart from the Almighty
a King does not prostrate
before anyone else.
If you do not allow me
to break this tradition, mother
then I will not be able
to sit on the throne.
Go on,
son.
Be seated on your throne
and grace this court.
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
The 'yajna' is almost complete,
Crown Prince Shishupal
but you have
not yet tarnished it.
A few rituals are
yet to be completed
Crown Prince Duryodhan.
First, Yudhishthir
will sit on the throne
then he will be crowned
and finally,
he will distribute
the offertory to the sages
and the Kings.
However, if the Rajsuya 'Yajna
is interrupted before he does so
it will be deemed unsuccessful,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.
And there are bound to be
a few lapses
in such a grand ceremony.
I am looking for that lapse,
Crown Prince.
But where is the throne?
Despite being an Emperor
how can he sit on the ground?!
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
Dear Yudhishthir
the way Surya Dev
graces the entire sky
by spreading his brilliant rays
and dispels the fear
of darkness in men
similarly
the Kings, who have
accepted your status
as the supreme Emperor
need to be sprinkled
with water on their heads
by you to rid them of fear.
This is the duty
of a supreme Emperor.
As you say,
Sage Vyas-
But dear,
Surya Dev himself
is under the authority
of Lord Vishnu in the heavens.
A supreme King
accepting the authority
of another person
is deemed correct
by the 'shastras.
A person
who can guide
the Emperor to righteousness.
Upon whose advice
the supreme Emperor
would engage in a battle
or call a truce.
Seeking the blessings
of such a person
and giving him the offertory
first is a tradition.
This tradition
is also called 'pudovas
or 'prathamarghya.
Who will you offer
the 'pudovas', dear?
Guide me in this,
Sage Vyas.
Either His Excellency Bhishma
or Vasudev Krishna
can be chosen for this ritual.
No, dear.
A person who is surrounded
by selfishness and greed
or there is a doubt to his
status of a righteous man
or is bound by the orders
of another person
does not have
the right to the
prathamarghya.
I am the General of Hastinapur.
Obeying the orders
of King Dhritarashtra
is my prime duty.
That is why,
dear
I cannot accept
this 'prathamarghya.
I think
Vasudev Krishna
rightfully deserves
the 'prathamarghya.
Revered guests
righteousness,
freedom and selflessness
are three virtues
mentioned by grandsire
all of which reside in Vasudev.
We brothers have been guided
several times by Vasudev.
He has the knowledge of the soul
the beauty of the mind
the agility of thoughts
and the strength
of determination.
Vasudev
do accept the 'prathamarghya
being offered to you.
Sahadev
cleanse the feet of Vasudev
and demonstrate the dedication
of us brothers towards him.
Did you see that?!
That was utterly foolish
of Yudhishthir!
Now, under no circumstance
will I let this 'yajna
get completed.
Stop, Emperor Yudhishthir!
So many great Kings have
displayed their
dedication to you.
By choosing
a deceitful and cunning cowherd
to offer the 'prathamarghya
you cannot insult us!
Our supreme Emperor
being under
the authority of a fool
is not something we will
accept, King Yudhishthir!
Crown Prince of Chedi
who is more deserving
than Vasudev in this court?
Righteousness
and unrighteousness
this world and the other
the soul and the Almighty
the truth and the lies
are known best
by no one but Vasudev.
All that is a lie!
Kings present here
if you look carefully
at the life of that Yadava
then you will know quite easily
that all he has ever done
is deceive and cheat people!
The milk and butter
that rightfully belonged
to King Kansa
was stolen by him
during his childhood!
That person
would instigate people
to revolt against King Kansa!
He led to the untimely deaths of
various friends of King Kansa.
Putana,
Bakasura
Chanun
Mushtik...
The list is endless,
Kings!
He is the one who stopped people
from worshipping Lord Indra.
That person
is not only a thief
but also an unrighteous man.
He is a rebel!
He is a liar!
Can the one who heeds his advice
ever work towards the welfare
of the Aryan region?
Tell me, Kings!
How can he work towards it?!
Be quiet,
Crown Prince of Chedi!
Your rambling on about Vasudev
is intolerable to me!
So, will you kill me?
Bheem, is only
your exterior that big
or do you have
any intelligence as well?
Just look at that
Vrikodar Bheem, Kings!
Just look!
He married a female ogre.
Now, tell me, Kings...
How can the dog that eats
the leftovers of people
ever be allowed to take
part in a veneration?!
But such an unrighteous Vrikodar
is deemed highly of
by that treacherous Krishna!
But such an unrighteous Vrikodar
is deemed highly of
by that treacherous Krishna!
Shishupal!
I will behead you!
Calm down,
Bheem!
Until His Highness
awards him a punishment
you cannot lay a finger on him
in this court.
Crown Prince of Chedi
do not cross your limits
in this court of mine.
Kings, this Yudhishthir...
He...
He is preaching to me
about crossing my limits
while he gave a runaway cowherd
the highest honour
in this court!
Yudhishthir
did your father
not teach you what is correct
and what is not?
But how could he?!
Pandu himself
had committed the unrighteous
deed of killing a sage.
Crown Prince of Chedi!
If you
have a problem with
our Rajsuya 'Yajna
then return to your kingdom
and wait to confront our army!
I promise you
that until you die
a canopy will not be built above
brother Yudhishthir's throne!
But do not resort
to verbal abuses
and diminish your respect.
You better be quiet,
Arjun.
By having the right thumb
of the poor Ekalavya cut
you have learnt
the art of archery.
You are the most treacherous
and lying low-life
I have ever seen!
Go
and drown yourself somewhere!
So, Kings!
The father of that Krishna
was a criminal!
That is why,
King Kansa
had imprisoned
Vasudev and Devaki.
Now, tell me! What is a person
born in a prison cell
called, Kings?!
What is he?!
A criminal.
Krishna is a criminal!
A criminal!
Crown Prince Shishupal
if you do not leave
my court this instant
then I will have to
sentence you to death.
I do not fear anyone.
Get up, Kings!
Get up!
These cowardly Pandavas
have no competence!
If they had any,
Emperor Jarasandha
would never have been
killed deceitfully!
In order to prove himself
as the most powerful man
in the entire Aryan region
that treacherous Krishna
has weaved a web of deception.

Greetings.
May you live long.
Wonderful!
You are way more skilled
in archery than me.
My knowledge of the art can
only improve the hunting skills
of my disciples.
Hunting?
That is not a form of art,
teacher.
I am wandering
around to learn.
I have gone
to numerous hermitages
and tried to become a disciple.
I have scaled the regions
of Kuru and Panchal for it.
I did not do so only
to learn the art of hunting.
But who will teach you
the skills that you seek?
You are well aware
that our community
does not have the right to
learn such higher skills.
Knowledge is made by God
as is water and air.
How can someone
have the right to it?
I do not wish to argue
with you, Karna.
You will gain nothing
from my hermitage.
Near the banks of river Drishadvati*
*"She with many stones", seasonal river estimated at southern boundaries of Kuru.
lies the hermitage
of the revered Drona.
Request him
if he's willing to accept you
as his disciple.
But know this.
To make an enemy of the entire
society only for your sake
is not something people
would either like
or have the capability
of doing so.
That is why accept the clan
you were born into
as your fate
and try to lead a happy life.
I do not believe in this
discrimination of caste.
I shall certainly go to
the revered Dronacharya
and learn from him.
Arjun.
Greetings, Sire.
Who are you?
- I am Karna.
I have come to you for I
have heard of your fame, Sire.
I hope to learn the art
of archery from you.
My father is the charioteer
of the great Bheeshma.
Son of a charioteer?
Then how could you even dream
of learning the art of archery?
Don't you know
that only Kshatriyas have
the right to higher knowledge?
Son of a charioteer...
Indeed!
I am the son of a charioteer!
And Sire, I am not asking for
a kingdom like the Kshatriyas.
I merely wish
to fortify my capabilities.
Then why can I not learn
the art of archery?
To a deserving person,
his capability is his blessing.
In that case, why did
you learn the art of battle?
Why are you teaching
military arts to your son
revered Drona?
Do not argue.
I am unique.
I was not born from
the womb of a woman.
I was born in the drona* vessel of sage Bharadwaj.
*Pitcher, leavepot.
If you also had a divine birth
then prove it.
Otherwise go away.
- Divine?
What do you mean by that, Sire?
The birth of every child
is divine for his parents.
No one has the right
to weigh the love of a mother
and the dreams of a father
in the scales of caste
and creed.
My father's heart
bleeds each time
he tells me to stay away
from archery.
Why does the society
frighten him so?
Why can I not be the reason
of pride and honour for him?
Why must I live
by curbing my capabilities?
Who has made these rules, Sire?
Did my father choose the caste
he would be born into?
Did his ancestors
make this choice?
Then why do such rules exist
that weigh human beings
on the scales of discrimination?
Why?
No.
I do not believe
in such rules, Sire.
I would be honoured to break
such traditions.
A bow belongs to a person
who can tie its string.
And that is acquired by deeds,
not by birth.
Your arrogance is soaring high
but it is worthless.
Higher knowledge belongs only
to Kshatriyas and Brahmins.
Not to people of a lower class.
Ghee* is used to light the
holy fire in a Yagna.
*A class of clarified butter.
But a clay oven is fuelled
with crude oil.
But Lord Parashuram
had used Ghee
to light a clay oven.
Go away.
Go away!
I do not even
wish to see your face.
I am leaving.
I shall go and gain knowledge
from the one
who imparted knowledge to you.
I shall return.
But let me assure you
that I shall return as the most
skilled archer of this nation.
And I shall be better
than all your disciples.
What does superiority mean?
Superiority means, having
more knowledge than others.
In other words, it is immaterial
how much
knowledge you have obtained.
The thing that matters is how
much more knowledge you have
obtained than others.
In other words,
the desire to be superior
makes even obtaining knowledge
a competition.
And when does victory become
decisive in a competition?
It is possible to be superior
for a limited period of time
but no one can be superior forever.
That is when discontent,
agony
and struggle are born.
But, instead
of becoming superior
if one tries to excel
then what would it be like?
To excel means to obtain
all that is worth obtaining.
It is not out of the desire
to gain more than others
but merely for
the contentment of the soul.
On the path of excellence
one does not
compete with others.
It is a competition
with oneself.
In other words, one trying
to excel will sooner or later
gain all the knowledge.
Even without trying,
he becomes superior.
But the one
who tries to be superior
may or may not succeed
but he can never excel.
Do think about it.
With my hair
I renounce the rules
of the society.
The society that has insulted me
shall be the recipient
of my blow.
With my old apparels
I renounce all traditions.
My new form will usher the
beginning of a new tradition.
By smearing the ashes of caste
and creed on my forehead
I pledge that henceforth
my capability is my identity
and my knowledge is my religion.
Greetings.
Are you a Brahmin?
I too, like you
am opposed to the Kshatriyas,
my Lord.
I am not opposed to Kshatriyas
but to the tyranny
of the Kshatriyas.
And even more than that
I am opposed to feeble Brahmins
feeble human beings
and the feeble society.
I have come to you
with the hope
of becoming strong.
I have given up teaching.
And I have donated
all my weapons.
But I
upon seeing
the aura of your face
am filled with the desire
of imparting knowledge to you.
If you are a Brahmin, son
then I shall indeed
impart knowledge to you.
People of our caste
can become only charioteers
and not warriors.
A charioteer carrying
weapons
has no place
in the kingdom of Kuru.
Are you the son
of a charioteer?
Then how could you even dream
of learning the art of archery?
Higher knowledge belongs only
to Kshatriyas and Brahmins.
Not to people
of a lower class.
I am
a Brahmin, my Lord.
Karna, from today, your
training in military arts
shall begin.
You created the sun,
Lord Parashuram?
My dear boy, similarly
the day you are
able to do this
your desire to learn
the art of archery
shall indeed be fulfilled.
12 Years Later.
Tonight,
the Pandavas
will slay Kichak.
I am awaiting
the sound of the duel
between Bheem and Kichak
to reach my ears.
Then we shall leave immediately
and render the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas
futile.
Let's go,
Princess.
I shall give you a lesson in the Rudra Tandava* tonight.
*Divine Shiva dance which depicts his violent nature, first as the creator and later as the destroyer of the universe, even of death itself.
At this hour?
Yes, Princess.
The appropriate time
to assume the Rudra form
is tonight and at this hour.
Soldiers,
stay right here
and do remember
that no one is allowed
inside this chamber.
Why is the chamber
so dark, Sairandhri?
What are you up to?
If you think your husbands
will kill me
right here in this chamber
then you are making
a very big mistake.
Let me
illuminate the chamber.
In order to have light
one must endure
the heat of fire, Kichak.
In order to get rid of
the darkness in your mind
you too must burn.
You are foolish.
This is neither Panchal
nor Hastinapur
but the kingdom of Matsya
and the courage to kill me
resides within no one here.
Bheem?
You could recognize Panchali
but not me?!
Do you wish to engage in a duel?
Do not be foolish,
Bheem.
If you are defeated
then you will be killed.
However,
if I get defeated
then all of you will have to
go on an exile for twelve years
Yet again.
It would be better
if you seek my refuge
and leave Draupadi
here with me.
Even if it is stuck in the mud
an elephant is still
a majestic being, Kichak!
Neither can hundred dogs
provide it with protection
nor can they harm it.
And I am not stuck
anywhere either.
I am utterly free
to punish you!
I will have to call out
to Duryodhan just once
and he shall
be here immediately.
Only when your voice
leaves this chamber
will Duryodhan be able
to hear you, fool!
That is the sound
of Brihannala's feet.
The rhythm of Tandava
will spell out your doom.
Those are the horses
of Damgranthi.
Listen carefully!
Their neigh is ushering
your death at lightning speed.
Those are the cows of Tantripal.
They are announcing
your punishment!
Listen!
You cannot leave
this place, Kichak.
Then how will you send
a message to Duryodhan?
Do you hear that,
my darling?!
Who could be making
such sounds at this hour?
They are indeed the Pandavas!
The Pandavas?
Why would the Pandavas produce
such sounds at this hour, uncle?
So that we fail to hear
Kichak's screams
while they kill him.
Let's go,
my darling.
We must save Kichak.
After killing Kichak
if the Pandavas hide themselves
then we will never
be able to find them.
If we apprehend the Pandavas now
then we will succeed
in our cause.
Let's go,
uncle.
Let's go.
General Kichak got slain...
Whoever committed this heinous
act will certainly be punished.
King Virat
go and apprehend
the Pandavas then.
General Kichak was slain
by the Pandavas.
The Pandavas are not present
in the city of Virat.
They are not present
in the kingdom of Matsya either.
By uttering such rubbish
do not attempt to spread
fear in the city, Crown Prince.
King Virat
General Kichak
was on to the Pandavas.
The coming morning at dawn
all the immigrants and guests
were to produce themselves
in the court on Kichak's orders!
His murder proves
that the offenders of Hastinapur
are present in your kingdom.
King Virat
we merely wish to look
for our offenders
in your kingdom
and we seek
your permission for it.
Impossible!
I have made
no such promise to you.
The one who made it
has been killed.
His promise has died
along with him.
In other words,
you are
taking the side of the Pandavas
Your Highness.
However, you seem
to be forgetting
that a man who builds an abode
next to the cremation grounds
has his food
tainted with the ash
of the deceased.
Since you have taken
the side of the Pandavas
you must also face
the consequences.
What you are implying,
King of Gandhar
is beyond my comprehension.
However, before I
lose my composure
all of you must
leave this place.
Soldiers
escort these three
to the borders of the city!
King Virat
each brick of your castle
will crumble.
Each subject of your kingdom
will die a gruesome death.
I shall slay
all your children
right before your eyes!
Tell the Pandavas
that if they have the competence
then they ought to be
prepared to protect you.
Very soon,
the army of Hastinapur
will attack the city of Virat.
It will attack
the city of Virat!
Hear all!
King Virat is on his way!
Your Highness
the inner part of the shell
that encloses a pearl safely
is way more brilliant
than the pearl itself.
Similarly,
your psyche
is illuminated with
the light of righteousness.
I have been humbled today
to have met a more
righteous man than me.
Emperor Yudhishthir
the moment you had come
to the city of Virat
I had decided to keep you hidden
and offer you protection.
However,
I am of the opinion
that it would be better if you
leave the city of Virat now.
Duryodhan must be awaiting you
with his army outside the city
and Hastsinapur is going to
attack us very soon.
This battle is being
orchestrated
to render our life of anonymity
futile, Your Highness.
If we produce ourselves to them
then there will be no battle.
Impossible!
If I cannot keep my promise then
it would also imply my defeat.
Emperor Yudhishthir,
all of you
must head West
using the secret passages.
I shall hold them off until you
complete your life of anonymity.
No,
King Virat.
We cannot forsake
our duties either.
Now, this battle
is not just yours
but ours as well.
We shall stay right here
and engage in this battle.
If we must produce
ourselves to them
then we shall accept it
as our fate.
If we must produce
ourselves to them
then we shall accept it
as our fate.
Brother Yudhishthir,
I am of the opinion
that when the Kuru army
stands outside the city of Virat
it will be the last day
of our life of anonymity.
We shall fight them
in our disguise.
If Duryodhan cannot
recognize us in twelve hours
then victory shall be ours!
Impossible!
This battle cannot take place.
In the Matsya kingdom,
the Crown Prince of Hastinapur
was gravely insulted,
grandsire!
So,
how can you say
that a battle cannot take place?
Without being invoked first
no God ever takes part
in a 'yajna,' dear.
Without informing first
no King or Crown Prince
can ever enter another kingdom.
Why did you travel to the
kingdom of Matsya, Crown Prince?
The General of the city of Virat
Kichak had invited us,
Minister.
The King of Virat had no right
to insult us so!
If that is the case
then King Virat must come
to Hastinapur and apologize.
If he does not do so
then we shall
fight him in a battle.
This is tradition.
You wish to while away time
in some way or the other,
Your Excellency Bhishma.
What about you,
Crown Prince?
You are trying to launch
an attack at the earliest.
Your Highness
there can be dire consequences
to this battle.
Forming an alliance
with the Pandavas
will be next to
impossible for us
if we do so.
Do the Pandavas
scare you,
Minister?
Or do you have
a soft corner for them
in your heart?
What kind of a Minister
advices one to forget how
one's kingdom was insulted?!
This is not only my insult
but also that of all of you!
This society
gives respect
only to those people
who can safeguard
their respect, father!
People in the future will say
that Hastinapur had been
rendered powerless
when Emperor Pandu
had stepped down as the King
and had made his blind brother
the new King.
Be quiet,
Duryodhan!
You have said enough.
People of the court
Duryodhan is correct.
A battle will indeed take place
Your Excellency.
Will we
be successful here,
uncle?
Certainly,
my darling.
When compared
to the ties of blood
the ties of tears
are more tenacious.
Use your tears
to tie
him.
Uncle
the last time we came here
we were gravely insulted!
How will coming here again
benefit us?
If the circumstances
you face
cannot be made
favourable for you
then you must
make them unfavourable
for the enemy.
When the situation
of the enemy worsens
the resulting benefit
will come to us.
But uncle,
how is that possible?
Look
over there.
All the strength
of the Aryan region
is on one side
and the might of those two men
is on the other.
The side these Yadavas
take in the battle
will be stronger
than the other.
Vasudev Krishna's affection
lies with the Pandavas and I
know that
but the mighty Balaram
deems you
his most favourite disciple.
Getting Subhadra
married to you
was a dear wish of his.
Think of how we were
insulted back then
my darling
and shed tears for it
today.
The mighty Balaram
will certainly agree
to take our side.
My darling
we must persuade Vasudev Krishna
to take our side as well.
Vasudev will never go against
his elder brother
and if Balaram
is on our side
then
even if the Pandavas
strive for their entire lives
they will not be able
to have their revenge.
And that will
lead them to their death
and we
will not even
have to do anything.
Greetings, guru.
Bless you.
Beloved Duryodhan
the entire Aryan region
is talking about you.
However, it would have
pleased me more
had this talk
been about your prowess
in mace fighting.
Greetings,
King of Gandhar.
Greetings, Balaram.
Welcome.
Vasudev.
Let's go.
You have given
my darling Duryodhan
a lot of things
mighty Balaram.
You gave him
the knowledge of warfare
gave him respect
gave him love
but
did not show him the path
to joy and contentment.
That is
precisely why we came
to Dwaraka.
Joy and contentment
are not places,
King of Gandhar
where one must go.
Both of them are paths.
The path of joy
leads to struggle
and that of contentment
to peace.
Where does the Crown Prince
wish to go?
What
is happening here,
Vasudev?
This is the Narayani* Army of Dwaraka, King of Gandhar.
*Narayani Sena was the Army of Krishna.
It is creating 
a labyrinth on the sea-shore
and at the moment
you are right in its center
as a captive.
But why,
Vasudev?
We came here
with the hope
to forge a friendship.
We are not here to fight.
Is the friendship forged
during times of trouble
not stronger,
King of Gandhar?
But do not worry.
You do not need true friendship
because at the moment
there is no reason
for you to worry.
A boy of royal blood
is playing a game
to navigate
through this labyrinth.
A boy
is playing a game to navigate
through this labyrinth!
He is Arjun and Subhadra's
son,
King of Gandhar.
He was born with
the competence of Arjun.
Even at this age he can
navigate through the labyrinth
made by the Narayani Army
and reach the center.
His name
is Abhimanyu.
Bless you!
Wonderful, dear.
Wonderful!
What?
Have you become
an accomplished warrior?
We have guests over.
Could you not restrain yourself
from displaying your skills
before them?
Our guests
were scared,
dear.
Uncle, I was not
demonstrating my skills.
I just could not restrain myself
from displaying my competence.
And a display of competence
does not scare guests
but enemies.
Brother Duryodhan had navigated
into King Drupad's labyrinth.
If you can navigate
out from this one
then we will be scared.
My father is bound
to teach me that
but who will teach uncle?
Dear Abhimanyu
does your father have
no support of competent warriors
that a boy of your age
is being made to navigate
into a labyrinth?
I had imbibed this knowledge
when I was in the womb.
And coming to navigating
out of a labyrinth...
Before a battle,
all the weapons are sharpened
and I too am my father's weapon
uncle Duryodhan.
Beloved Duryodhan
it has been days
since I have had the opportunity
to have a mace fight
with an able warrior.
How about
we have a little
mace fight of our own?
Only then will we talk.
As you say,
guru.
Pick up your mace,
beloved disciple.
Vasudev
it seems as though
the mighty Balaram
does not deem this
a friendly duel.
The truth is,
my darling
is being beaten up by him.
Does one
not beat up and hurt another
in a friendly duel,
King of Gandhar?
The guru is punishing
his disciple.
The guru had taught his disciple
the art of mace fighting
but the disciple
deemed playing a game of dice
more appropriate.
The game of dice
has ended
thirteen years ago
Vasudev.
It had begun then.
Thirteen years ago
you had begun this game,
King of Gandhar.
And when a game is begun,
it is also vital to end it.
And when a game is begun,
it is also vital to end it.
When one team employs
a strategy in a game
the other team also has
the right to employ
its own strategy.
It is time now for the Pandavas
to employ their strategy
King of Gandhar.
Abhimanyu!
Sister!
What are you doing?
I am bidding my sword goodbye.
Now, this sword will assume
the form of the Almighty
and help me reform my life.
I have failed the purpose
of my birth today.
No, sister.
Do not say that.
You do not know, Draupadi
but I was born
to deal with weapons.
Flowers not only emit fragrance
but also look beautiful
and provide seeds.
But a thorn...
A thorn is born
only to prick others.
What...
What do I now, Draupadi?
The people who do not
succeed in the battlefield
do they also not
succeed in life, sister?
I cannot be.
If ember loses its fire
it is nothing but coal.
Dark and ugly.
The person who touches it
becomes dirty.
If the fire within me dies out
I too shall become so!
The way
a serpent is born with
a poison pouch in its mouth
similarly, I was born
with anger and vengeance.
It is a tie of my
previous life, Draupadi.
If I do not hold a weapon
my entire being gets
filled with dejection.
To be the General of Panchal
is the basis of my life.
But
father snatched this basis
from me today.
He rendered all my efforts
fruitless today.
That can never happen, sister.
Father shall certainly
reappoint you as the General.
I shall talk to him.
You... You need
to come with me, sister.
You need to come with me.
Father will never listen
to you, Draupadi.
He shall indeed listen to me.
I was born from
a sacrificial fire.
I am a blessing of the Gods.
Did father not say so himself?
He shall certainly listen to me.
You need to come
with me, sister.
Come with me, sister.
Let's go, sister.
Come with me, sister.
Greetings, father.
May you be invincible.
Father.
Father
sister deserves this respect.
Without any apparent reason
how can you take this right
away from sister?
How dare you question
your own father?
Only a father can answer
the questions of his children.
In order to question
one's father
a child only requires
a question.
One does not require
courage for it.
Quit with your rambling,
Draupadi!
Shikhandini has
murdered my trust.
She was supposed
to slay Bhishma
but was defeated
by the Kuru Princes!
How will she
defeat Bhishma then?!
She has proven the prediction
of the Gods to be false!
Even Dhrishtadyumna was given
to you by the Gods, father.
If you have faith
in Dhrishtadyumna
then why not in sister?
Because she is a woman!
Women can bear jewellery
but not swords!
Goddess Durga* is also a woman, father.
*Goddess of Victory of Good over Evil, "the invincible", the most popular incarnation of Devi/Goddess Shakti--the female aspect of the divine.
She bears not one
but ten weapons.
The way I am a blessing
of the Gods to you
similarly
sister is also
a gift of the Gods.
I do not require
any such gift or blessing.
You do not require it?
Father
why did you ask for me from Agni Dev* then?
*The god of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices.
I did not ask for you!
The Gods have sent you
because of their intransigence!
They have sent you
by defeating me!
The truth is that you are
a symbol of my weakness!
You and that Shikhandini!
The two of you remind me
of my defeat!
The two of you remind me
of my defeat!
You cannot insult your children
in this manner, father.
One who does not get
respect from one's father
to that person, no respect
can ever make him happy.
I, your daughter, father
beg of you
to not commit injustice
by destroying
sister's self-confidence.
This is not injustice.
This is a punishment!
Punishment for being defeated!
Because I never accept defeat!
But in that battle
were you also
not defeated, father?
Then why punish only sister?
If you wish to stay alive
then go from here.
Otherwise, for committing the
crime of insulting your father
you shall be sent
to the gallows!
There is no place for you
in Kampilya any longer!
Go!
Go!
No, father!
Please pardon her.
Guard
this maiden has been banished
from the city of Kampilya!
Take her to the gates
of the city!
Right away!
Take her to the gates
of the city!
Right away!
If this is your order, father
then I shall certainly go away.
I am your daughter.
If I stay here after this insult
it will tarnish your reputation.
Draupadi, no.
Draupadi..
No, Draupadi.
Stop, Draupadi.
Stop!
Father, stop Draupadi.
Father, she has no
knowledge of the world.
Who will protect her?
Please do not banish
my sister, father.
Stop her.
Stop, Draupadi!
Father
I apologize on her behalf.
Please pardon us.
Draupadi, stop!
I did not ask for you!
The Gods have sent you
because of their intransigence!
The truth is that you are
a symbol of my weakness!
They have sent you by defeating
me! You and that Shikhandini!
There is no place for you
in Kampilya any longer!
Go!
If you wish to stay alive
then go from here.
Otherwise, for committing the
crime of insulting your father
you shall be sent
to the gallows!
This maiden has been banished
from the city of Kampilya!
Take her to the gates
of the city!
Go!
Brother had said
where the Sudarshana Chakra
fails to work
is where the melody of flute does.
He had also told me
that only if I bear
humility in my heart
will I be able to win
over the High Queen.
Sister-in-law.
No!
You cannot address me
by that term.
I'm not addressing you
as 'sister-in-law
but you will address me as one.
Sister-in-law!
Please pardon my husband.
I have given you
all that I had with me.
Now, please allow us
to enter the city.
Unfortunate is he
who cannot revere
Madhav's flute.
Do proceed to the gates
of the city.
Let me make preparations
to welcome both of you.
"This is such a complex
matter of rights."
"This is a matter of honour."
"It seems to be"
"on the verge of success."
"My heart must remain steadfast"
"and this is a vow
I must fulfil."
"My heart will remain steadfast"
"and this is the purpose
of my life."
May you be blessed
with a son, Subhadra.
May the Almighty make your son
inherit the glory and valour
his father possesses.
Panchali...
I have wronged you.
I hope you will pardon me.
I've accepted the peculiarities
of my fate, My Lord
but my heartache will fade away
the day I comprehend
the meaning of such fate.
Madhav had ordered me
to get married, Panchali.
The future of the entire
Aryan region
rested on this marriage.
Madhav had told me so.
And brother Balaram had said...
I am not asking you
the reason, My Lord.
I wish to know what it means.
Man decides why
he does certain things
but its meaning...
Its meaning is decided
by the Almighty.
It meant only one thing...
The subjects of the entire
Aryan region
deserve to be happy
and contented
and free from exploitation.
And unrighteousness needs
to be eradicated from the world.
All this is possible
only when brother Yudhishthira
becomes the emperor
of the Aryan region
and you
become the Empress
of the Aryan region.
Mother's orders
Madhav's wish
and our efforts
are propelling us
towards this goal.
If that is the case, My Lord
then my heartache will fade away
the day when, in order
to realise this meaning
you will take the first step.
The road to the 'Rajsuya Yajna
of Indraprastha
has many obstacles in it.
Please begin to get
rid of them, My Lord.
Uncle...
We must approach
Shishupal of Chedi for aid.
He is an enemy
of Vasudeva Krishna.
No, my child.
No.
Even if you assemble
an army of monkeys
you will not be
able to fight a lion.
Shishupal is foolish.
He deems verbal abuses
to be weapons.
Krishna can crush him
in a single moment.
The Yadavas are afraid
only of King Jarasandha.
Krishna had killed
his own uncle Kansa.
Kansa was the son-in-law
of Jarasandha.
In order to exact his revenge
King Jarasandha had attacked
the Yadavas several times
and left them terrorised.
In the end, the Yadavas
had to leave Mathura
and flee to Dwaraka.
My child, you are not acquainted
with King Jarasandha's might.
But, uncle...
Why would Jarasandha help us?
We are not going
to approach him for help.
We are going to seek his refuge.
I, the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur
am to seek his refuge?
Indeed, my child!
Indeed.
The climbers of a forest
seek the refuge of a tree
and then, drain the nutrients
of that very tree.
This is politics.
If you wish to conquer
the entire Aryan region someday
and become its emperor
then you must
seek the refuge
of King Jarasandha today.
If you wish to defeat Krishna
and stop the 'Rajsuya Yajna
of Indraprastha
then only King Jarasandha
will make that possible.
If Jarasandha kills the Yadavas
then how would it
benefit us, uncle?
If you cannot break a stick
then you must
cleave it
right through the middle.
If the Pandavas
and the Yadavas
are separated
then breaking them
will be easier.
He is the only person
who can make
the entire Aryan region
shudder at his very mention
because Jarasandha
cannot be killed.
Because Jarasandha
cannot be killed.
Cannot be killed?
How can that be possible, uncle?
Jarasandha's father,
King Brihadratha
had two wives
but no children.
The Great Sage Chandakaushika
gave King Brihadratha a fruit
in order to bear children.
The King divided
that fruit into two
and gave one half
to each of his wives.
Both his wives gave birth
to two halves of a child.
It was then that the King
prayed to the female ogre Jara.
The ogre Jara used her powers
to join the two halves
which brought the child to life.
Since Jara had amalgamated
the two halves
the child
came to be known
as Jarasandha.
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
Come forward and demonstrate
your might!
Come forth!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
He cannot be killed
with any weapon.
The secret to killing
King Jarasandha
is known only by the ogre Jara
and the Almighty.
No one else knows about it.
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!
Let's go, my child.
Let's go, my child!
Only after consuming poison
did Lord Shiva
earn the right of bearing
the crescent moon on his head.
Gulp down this poison of insult.
Hail the Emperor!
Greetings, King Jarasandha!
Emperor Jarasandha!
So, you are the one
who had approached
Vasudeva Krishna
to marry his sister.
Pardon the heart of the Prince,
Your Highness.
He fell in love.
That is a lie,
King of Gandhar!
I have heard a lot
about your feats.
All your actions
reek of politics
and not love.
Because your political ploys
were unsuccessful there
you have come to Magadha
to achieve success.
To me, Emperor Jarasandha.
Your Highness,
when one door closes
one must open another.
That is how rodents behave,
King of Gandhar.
When the entrance
to their shelter gets closed
they scurry in another direction
to dig a new passage.
However, the den of a lion
has only one entrance
and the courage
to block that passage
is possessed by no one!
No one!
Your Highness,
do not let your might
become your terminal point.
We have come to you
with a proposal.
You ought to perform
a 'Rajsuya Yajna.
The entire army of Hastinapur
and the enemies of the Yadavas
will stand by you.
You ought to declare yourself
the Emperor
of the entire Aryan region.
When one does not have the
strength to fight one's battles
engaging in one is foolishness,
King of Gandhar.
Foolishness!
For all these years
you have fought your own battles
Emperor Jarasandha.
Yet, Vasudeva Krishna is alive
and the Yadavas are prosperous.
Your Highness...
If even one of the flames
goes unextinguished
the wind is deemed weak.
And now, Vasudeva Krishna
has become the sun
from being a flame!
Even taking that cowherd's name
in Magadha is a crime!
So, how dare you praise him!
The three of you shall be
sentenced to death!
Soldiers, arrest them!
Have them beheaded and send
their heads to Krishna!
My darlings...
Surrender yourselves.
Have faith in the gambit
of Shakuni.
Very soon,
the Pandavas
will be unable
to understand the difference
between a door and a wall.
Very soon,
the Pandavas
will be caught
in our web.
So, Your Highness...
Do you approve of these rules?
I approve of them.
Think once about it,
my darling.
Your might just have to
bet your pride here.
The Emperor has made up his mind
to play till the end
and so must you.
I agree.
Your Excellency
are you contented with this?
I am contented.
Your Excellency
in this game,
neither of the players
must engage in foul play
or break the rules
and to ensure that
you will have to stay
in the court till the end.
You are the only one
whom the entire court trusts.
Now, if the Empress wishes
then she may proceed
to the chamber of Her Highness
so that we may begin the game.
My Lord
something that
man takes pride in
and also has the right to
need not necessarily be
the same thing.
I have firm faith
that only after scrutinizing
both pride and right
will you place the bets.
You have my word.
Your Highness
will you throw the dice
on your own
or do you wish to have it done
by someone else?
Is there not a rule to throw
one's dice on one's own here?
Your Highness,
this is a right
which belongs to the player
and he
can give this right
to someone else.
The way I have given this right
to uncle.
My hands are proficient
in fighting with a mace
but worse than useless
in throwing the dice,
Your Highness.
King of Gandhar,
is it not true
that your dice
dance to your tunes?
His Excellency Bhishma had
compared the dice to fortune
Prince Arjun.
And if I had
the right to my fortune
then Gandhar would
never have met
with any injustice.
Your Highness.
Your Highness
do go ahead and tell us
who will go first.
I have limited property
with me, uncle
but the Emperor has the entire
Aryan region with him!
Hence, the person to go first
should be me,
Your Highness.
I agree,
brother Duryodhan.
Tell me what you would
like to bet first.
I have one lakh
gold coins with me
which I have obtained
with my own efforts.
I have the right to them
and take pride in them as well.
By participating
in various competitions
and emerging victorious
I have procured 5,000 horses.
Then I have my apparels
and jewellery.
My father had
presented me with five villages.
This is
all the property I have with me
to which I have the right
and take pride in as well.
I bet my entire property
in the first round!
The entire property in one go!
If you are defeated
then will you play just once
and put an end to this game?
But if I win this round
then all this property
will become double
beloved Nakul.
So, Your Highness...
Go on.
You also need to bet
objects of equal worth
in the first round.
Brother Duryodhan, the worth
of the objects bet by you
shall be matched
by me by betting
the objects which come
under my possession.
You must be familiar
with the game of dice.
These four pieces
leave their bases
traverse the entire path
and come back to their bases.
Your pieces
can capture those
of the Crown Prince
and remove them from the game.
The player who has
the most number
of pieces in the base
or
the one who captures
all the pieces of the opponent
and removes them from the game
is the winner.
I know the rules,
King of Gandhar.
Though I oppose this game
I am not ignorant of it.
Indeed.
Let the game of dice begin.
Splendid, Your Highness!
Splendid!
In the very first go,
your dice have
rolled out a sum of 12.
In other words,
you get to roll the dice again.
There you go,
Your Highness.
The game has had
a fantastic beginning.
My dice have also rolled out
a sum of 12.
So, I shall roll the dice again.
There you go,
Your Highness.
One of my pieces is
on a castle square.
Over here, neither can
your piece capture mine
nor jump and go beyond it.
Splendid, Your Highness!
Splendid!
You have captured a piece
of my beloved Duryodhan.
Your chances of winning
have increased.
And there is nothing surprising
about it, Your Highness.
I have heard that fortune
is a slave to supreme Emperors.
There you go,
King of Gandhar.
This proves that
fortune is impartial.
Now, I too have
only three pieces left.
You and I are
in the same boat now.
You and I are
in the same boat now.
Go on.
It is your turn now.
Look at these,
Empress.
All these apparels and jewellery
will be presented to you
by Hastinapur.
The moment the game of dice ends
the Emperor and Empress
will be honoured
by Hastinapur
by having a gala festival.
Only those people
get such an honour
who have not been
accepted whole-heartedly.
I do not crave presents or
such an honour, Your Highness.
Will the Kuru Princes
accept my husbands
and me as a part
of the Kuru dynasty?
All of you belong
to the Kuru dynasty
and everyone has
accepted that, dear.
Sister-in-law
what Draupadi meant was
that the board of 'chausar
is not the battlefield.
First and foremost,
they must accept this.
The meaning of a game
is not winning or losing.
Its sole purpose
is entertainment
and they must understand this.
Your Highness
both the players now have
only one piece remaining.
The player whose piece
reaches its base first
will be the winner.
In order to win,
you need just
seven points.
Uncle
I have bet all my dreams here
by putting my trust in you.
If your dice do not
roll in my favour
then there will be
a reversal in my fortune.
My darling
all my plans are made keeping
reversal of fortune in mind.
First, one must put an end
to the suspicions of the enemy
and then his confidence
kills him on its own.
The real game
has begun now.
Your Highness,
let's see
what fortune has in store
for my beloved Duryodhan.
He needs
a score of 12.
Go on, dice...
May His Highness have happiness!
Your Highness,
you have been defeated.
Greetings,
Her Highness.
The Crown Prince had bet
his entire property
but the Emperor has
lost the first round.
But the game is now over,
is it not?
No, Your Highness.
The Crown Prince is about to
place his second bet.
What will he bet this time?
Will you bet your whole property
again, brother Duryodhan?
We are done betting
our properties, Your Highness.
How much pride
can one take in one's property?
True pride
lies in relationships
Your Highness.
I take pride
in my brother Vikarna.
He is an ace archer
and as he is younger to me
I have the right to him.
My younger brother
Vikarna is my next bet.
And if I lose
then his entire life,
Vikarna
will be your servant.
So, Your Highness...
So, which
younger brother of yours
would you like to bet?
Don't waste your potential by
punishing yourself, Yudhisthira.
They, who are the cause
of this state of yours
need to be punished.
They, who tried to dishonour
my friend's dignity!
If the wife of five Pandavas
can be treated like this
then much worse can happen
to ordinary women
in Duryodhan's kingdom.
Give it a thought.
Justice and protection...
It's your righteous duty
to establish these two.
Not for revenge.
You will have to fight a battle
for the ultimate reality.
Here are the five gems
of the tiara
which Madhav had given you.
But don't adorn them
in the tiara.
Your vow was justified.
Until the battle is over
neither tie your hair
nor adorn the tiara.
Your open locks
will keep reminding us
of our life's goal!
If that's your promise
then listen to my
resolution...
Until I wash my hair
with the blood
from Dushasana's chest
I will not tie my hair!
That will definitely happen,
Draupadi.
I will wash your hair with the
blood from Dushasana's chest.
King Dhritarashtra
and Queen Gandhari's lives
will see no ray of light,
Draupadi.
Only darkness
will surround them!
Forgive me, Your Highness
but we have been ordered
to put off the lamps.
Orders to put off the lamps?
- Yes, Your Highness.
It's the Queen's orders
that there will be darkness
in the whole of Hastinapur,
today.
No lamps or flambeaux shall
be lit even in the royal palace.
Forgive me, but I will
have to carry out the orders.
Mother, what sort
of an order have you given?
Why are all the lamps
and flambeaux
of the palace
being put off?
Because the whole of Hastinapur
is in darkness today, Duryodhan.
No one is able to see
their future.
Everyone's stumbling
in darkness
but no one knows
it's darkness.
These lamps and flambeaux
give everyone
a false illusion of light.
- You can see darkness
because you're blindfolded,
dear sister.
In reality, today, Hastinapur
sees the light of fortune.
You should declare Diwali
in the whole kingdom.
- Brother!
You see fortune?
How?
Pandavas will definitely return
to take revenge.
They will kill
all my 100 sons.
But how will you understand
what I'm going through?
You have always given more
importance to ambitions.
Duryodhan...
You have taught Duryodhan
to love the throne
more than his mother.
I know that you have given
a lot of love to my sons.
But it's the result of your love
that Duryodhan
has continuously been committing
unrighteous deeds
in order to get the throne.
Brother
at least for once you
should have thought of me.
Other women bear their children
in their womb
for just nine months.
I
kept them in my womb
for two years.
How will I be able to bear
the news of their death?
Why will we die, mother?
You have no faith in my
strength, mother.
Keep quiet, Duryodhan.
I heard from the maids about
what happened at the court.
How all the apparels
covered Draupadi
in the court.
Even after seeing
that miracle
you're boasting
about your strength.
Draupadi's curse
is still echoing
in my ears.
This is the curse
of Yajna's child, Draupadi.
Duryodhan will definitely
be punished for his deeds.
Thirteen years later
when I'll return their
property to them
I'll definitely ask
Yudhisthira to promise
to not wage a war.
No such occasion shall arise,
Your Highness.
No property shall be returned.
In the incognito
year of exile
we will crush
the Pandavas
and send them
to exile
once again.
This is a false hope,
brother.
My heart
trembles every moment.
Brother...
Brother
till today I always stopped
you from doing unrighteous.
Today I request to you
do anything
unrighteous...
Yes, unrighteous deed!
Definitely.
I will take responsibility
for all the sins.
If Vasudeva Krishna
fights the battle
along with the Pandavas
then my family
will be ruined.
My family will be ruined,
brother.
It will be ruined!
Mother!
- Gandhari!
Vasudeva Krishna!
May you be glorious,
Pandavas.
For 12 years to come
prepare for war.
Arjun, like Goddess Durga's
trident...
Like Lord Brahma's
four faced weapon...
In the same manner
is Lord Mahadev's
weapon of destruction.
During the battle,
if you ever face a situation
where you have
to confront a power
which is beyond
your competency
then you will need
Lord Mahadev's weapon.
Hence, Arjun
go to Kailash.
Practice austerity
to please Mahadev
and acquire
the weapon from him.
Bhima
the science
of physical strength...
No one knows that better
than Hanuman.
Hence you will
go to mountain Gandhamadana
*Mt. Gandhamadana is the tallest peak on Pamban Island which lies in the Palk Strait between mainland India and Sri Lanka.
and near the Hanumanth cave
you will perform penance
for Lord Hanuman.
Acquire strength from him.
Nakula
Sahadeva
both of you will have to acquire
the benevolence of the Ashvins
so that when time comes
you're able to protect
your army.
Yudhisthira
you very well know
that righteousness
is the basis of victory
and the basis of righteousness
is serving the ascetics
as well as the company
of the highest truth.
Hence you and Draupadi
for the next 12 years
will serve the ascetics
and gather virtue.
Your wish is our command.
Subhadra will be safe with you
at Dwarka.
Definitely, Arjun.
Subhadra's son who
takes birth there...
I will train him
to be a warrior.
Your son Abhimanyu will
be immortal in history, Arjun.
All of you proceed
towards the forest.
May you be blessed
with a blissful life.
Why is righteousness
defeated, brother?
And why does unrighteousness
win?
Achieving something
is not victory
and losing something
is not defeat.
It's the impact of time,
Subhadra.
Change is the only thing
constant in life.
Were you aware that all this
was happening in Dwarka?
Yes, brother!
This has been happening
since a while.
I tried stopping it.
But the subjects of Dwarka
get drawn to the path
of immorality repeatedly.
When a river meets a waterfall
it's speed grows even further.
Even when the society
treads the path of immorality
it gets completely tainted
with injustice.
Yudishtir is the one to be
blamed for all of this.
He gambled his own wife
in that filled courtroom.
And now, all over the Arya clan
people are following
that despicable practice.
No, elder brother!
No!
Neither is brother Yudishtir
to be blamed
nor brother Duryodhan.
It is the righteousness
that is to blame
that gets bound by malice...
That surrenders before malice...
In reality, it is the blindness
of traditions.
There is no such thing
as righteousness.
Please elaborate, brother.
When a man holds on stubbornly
to his oaths and promises
it is great indeed,
elder brother.
But is being stubborn
in every situation
any wise?
The same happened
in that filled courtroom.
Grandsire Bheeshma,
Master Drona
Vidur, the wise one,
and the eldest brother Yudishtir
were all bound by their words
and remained blinded
by tradition.
Just fulfilling their oaths
and promises
seemed like righteousness
to them.
Even if one of them had
broken out of their solemnity
Draupadi would never face
such grave injustice.
What do you mean to say,
Krishna?
Isn't fulfilling of oaths
appropriate?
Righteousness is like a tree,
elder brother.
Oaths and promises
are its branches.
But the roots of the tree are
compassion.
The branches are
significant too.
But not as much as the roots.
If in order to end one's agony
a promise has to be broken
it is appropriate.
But here, at this present time
compassion has been destroyed
all across the Arya clan.
All across the world!
One values his agony
more than that his dear ones.
And the agony of dear ones
matters more than society's...
Compassion has drained out
of this society.
When there is no compassion
in the society
people do not bond
with each other, elder brother.
They just live for
their own comfort.
The plight that Dwarka
is in today
is the plight of
all of Arya clan.
The branches of trees
that snap off the trunk
dry up and become wood.
Similarly, at this time,
righteousness
has grown lifeless.
It is time to revive
righteousness, elder brother!
Once again the society must be
made aware of righteousness.
Our administration will handle
the injustice prevailing
in Dwarka, Krishna.
But I am facing
another grave problem.
That is due to the injustice
prevailing in the Arya clan.
The prospective war between
the Kauravas and Pandavas.
There shall indeed be a war,
elder brother!
When compassion is destroyed
within a society
the society itself
decides a war for itself.
The Kauravas and Pandavas
are mere clans.
A river has banks.
But a flood has no banks.
Even we cannot be mere
spectators in this war, brother.
We have to fight
on someone's behalf.
You are right, Krishna.
But brother, an equally
important truth is
the side to which
you shall incline to
will turn into the just side
by default, Krishna.
Now try proving me false.
What are you doing, son?
Whose heads are you smashing?
That head was supposed
to be yours.
Dear son, Abhimanyu.
If you severe my head
your uncle Bheem shall be angry.
Because the oath to slay
all of us hundred brothers
is your uncle Bheem's.
And you father wants
to slay the armoured Karna.
Then I shall slay your sons,
uncle!
Whoever the blood of
Grandsire Dhritarashtra runs in
shall bleed it all out
on the battlefield!
Son Abhimanyu, there are
two more heads
that you can severe.
Your uncle Krishna
and uncle Balram.
Because your uncle
has chosen our side.
Will you be able to
severe his head?
If an earthen pot has
held poison even once
it has to be smashed,
uncle Duryodhan.
Couldn't you severe the heads?
Because the heads of
both my uncles
can never nurse the thought of
siding with injustice.
Brilliant!
Brilliant indeed, Son Abhimanyu!
You have indeed understood
both your uncles well.
Come.
It is time now for you
to train for mace combat.
Proceed and wait for me.
Bless you!
Forgive me, Balram,
the mighty one!
But you have promised that...
- That...
I shall not fight
on behalf of the Pandavas.
But neither had I assured you,
King of Gandhar
that I would fight
on behalf of the Kauravas.
So how did you arrive
at this conclusion?
I shall not fight on
anyone's side in this battle.
I shall not fight on
anyone's side in this battle.
Because after all,
both sides are my family.
And how can I engage
my own family in battle?
Therefore, will Krishna
and his army not participate in
this war either, Master Balram?
You better question him
regarding that decision.
Krishna is Lord Narayana.*
*The Refuge of Everyone.
And all decisions pertaining to
the army of Narayana
will be made by Himself.
Dear Duryodhan,
go and counsel with Krishna.
He has promised me
that he won't be partial.
Whoever approaches him first
he will provide that person
with appropriate help.
But remember.
Victory lies to the side
that Krishna will be on.
Permit me!
My lad, go and meet Krishna
immediately.
Meet him before Arjun does.
Remember.
Under any circumstances,
Krishna, the son of Vasudev
should be on our side.
And also the army
of Lord Narayana.
Meet him at the earliest.
Make haste, my lad!
Make haste!
My Lord!
My Lord!
The eldest one has
sent a message.
He has consented with
Lord Krishna and the Yadav army
with participating
in the battle.
Hurry up, My Lord!
Request brother Krishna
to aid our side with the army
of Lord Narayana.
Krishna has always been
on the side of
truth and justice.
If there is no truthfulness
on our side
there is no use asking him.
You have to ask him, My Lord!
Help is granted without asking.
But blessings...
Blessings must be sought.
And if brother supports you
without asking
brother Duryodhan will claim
that Krishna is being partial.
Krishna has promised
that whoever
approaches him first
he shall surely grant him
whatever he asks for.
Please go soon, My Lord.
You must approach Krishna before
the son of Dhritarashtra does.
Please go soon!
Arjun, why are you
seated on the ground?
A beseecher's place
lies on the ground, Krishna.
You aren't a beseecher, Arjun,
you are my friend.
If I am a friend
how does my position matter?
Even prince Duryodhan
awaits your counsel.
Welcome brother Duryodhan!
I did not spot you
as you were seated above.
Excuse me!
Krishna.
I am not seated higher.
I am seated next to you.
Very well!
Would you like some
refreshments?
The 'ksheer pak'* made from the milk of Dwarka's cows.
*A milk decoction.
You shall not find it even in
the celestial world.
My gratitude, Krishna!
I am not here for refreshments.
I am here to discuss
an important matter.
We shall indeed discuss,
brother Duryodhan.
First, let me hear
Arjun's request.
Go ahead, Arjun.
But, Krishna.
You had promised master Balram
that whoever approaches you
first
you shall join his side.
Impossible.
Brother could never decipher
this meaning from my words.
I had said
whoever appears before me first
I shall surely grant his wish.
You speak first, Arjun.
I shall bring all your brothers
back to life.
I shall be eternally grateful
to you, Dharma Raj.
I am very pleased
and also quite eager
to bless you
with any boon you ask for.
Go ahead and ask for
power, competence
weapons, wealth, army
or any other thing you like.
By bringing the four brothers
of mine back to life
you have given me
power, competence
and wealth,
Dharma Raj.
The only blessing we wish
to seek, Dharma Raj
is that may we five brothers,
along with our wife
be able to complete our final
year of exile in anonymity.
I shall bless all of you with
the art of disguising yourselves
dear Yudhishthir.
During your final year
of exile in anonymity
the art of disguising yourselves
will aid you in staying hidden.
It is time now,
dear Yudhishthir
for all four of your brothers
to leave to complete
their meditation.
Even the Gods are quite eager
to see righteousness
prevail once again on the earth.
Bless you,
dear.
What danger had befallen
all of you, My Lords?
There was no danger,
Panchali.
It was only a test.
Call it the first test,
Sahadev.
We have to give many more tests
in the next 12 years.
One's meditation is incomplete
without tests.
That is why,
the time has come
for Bheem, Arjun,
Nakul and Sahadev
to leave in order to complete
their respective meditation.
Will everyone
go in different directions
from this place, My Lord?
Yes, Panchali.
One has to revere
the Gods for ages.
Only then do they get pleased.
We have only 12 years
to please them.
You are correct,
My Lord.
The people who know their limits
become truly powerful.
If one remembers this key point
then I am certain
that all of you will
indeed be successful.
My Lord Arjun
I fear that
your meditation will be
the most arduous one
because when
Mahadev tests someone
He shakes up the belief
of that person completely.
However, the faith
of the five of us
will become your might.
You need not be scared.
And neither do you need
to hide from us so, spies.
In order to keep an eye on us,
you have been
travelling with us
all this while.
That is why, you are
like family to us now.
Henceforth,
all your meals
shall be brought by me.
- No, Your Highness.
We cannot have a meal with you.
You most certainly can.
And you need not tell Duryodhan
anything regarding this.
However
you must tell him
that we will not hide
for the next 12 years.
That is why,
sending spies after us
is of no use.
However,
in the thirteenth year
when we shall live
a life of anonymity
all the treachery
of the King of Gandhar
all the competence
of the King of Anga
and even the entire
property of Duryodhan
will not be able to find us.
We shall appear
only when we decide to.
Tell the 100 sons
of King Dhritarashtra
that the son of Pandu,
Vrikodar Bheem, shall arrive
as their death
and one can only await it.
It cannot be stopped.
These many 'laddoos' are
sufficient for Lord Hanuman.
A sacrament is merely
meant to be tasted.
The Almighty feels satiated with
the devotion of the devotee!
I should keep two more
laddoos' aside for myself.
Om Anjani Sut Pavan Putra
Tubhyam Namah!
Aavaha...
Om Anjani Sut Pavan Putra
Tubhyam Namah!
Aavaha...
Om Hanumate Marute
Tubhyam Namah!
Aavaha...
Go!
Go away!
This sacrament is for Lord Hanuman, son of Pavan Dev.*
*Pavan Dev: a name of Vayu, the god of wind.
You ate the 'laddoo
meant for the Lord!
I shall be held accountable
for this along with you.
Go away.
Go away from here!
What would the Almighty do
with two 'laddoos?
One is more than
sufficient for Him.
Om Hanumate Marute
Tubhyam Namah!
Aavaha...
Get away!
Who are you?!
You seem to be
an illusory being!
I think you have been sent here
to interrupt my meditation
by that wicked Duryodhan!
You seem to be
an adept illusory being
but do not forget
that I have married an ogre!
My son is
an illusory being as well!
Your illusion will not
work before me.
I will kill you.
Markatasur,* just wait a moment!
*Monkey demon.
You are a strange human being.
First, you invoke me
and call me for a meal
and then fight with me
for no apparent reason.
Pardon me, My Lord!
Pardon me!
I had only imagined you
in your titan avatar.
I could not recognize you
in this tiny form of yours.
Upon seeing a tiny being
did you also underestimate
his might, Bheem?
In other words
you do not know
the true form of might.
I seek your refuge to know
precisely that, My Lord.
You are my younger
brother, Bheem.
By praying to my father,
Pavan Dev
your parents had been
blessed with you.
That is why, I shall indeed tell
you about the mystery of might.
First,
you must...
That sacrament
is meant for me,
is it not?
So, go bring it.
You ate all my 'laddoos,
brother Hanuman.
At least leave that one for me.
So, take it.
Speed should be
in the nature of might.
The might that becomes inactive
gets disintegrated.
That is why, in order
to serve Lord Ram
when Pavan Dev created me
He gave me the form of a monkey.
I shall always remember this.
Please give that to me now,
brother Hanuman!
Then get up.
When did I stop you?
Splendid.
Marvellous.
Composure should be
in the nature of might.
When one has a lively exterior
it is essential
to have a calm mind
otherwise the whole
of might falls apart.
No matter what task is at hand
it can only be successful
when the person executing it
has a lively exterior
and a calm mind.
That is why
in a battlefield
I focus my thoughts
on Lord Ram
in order to stay calm.
Indeed. I shall
always remember this.
But at least give me
that 'laddoo,' brother.
Take it.
You are indeed my
younger brother, Bheem.
No one can learn
the mystery of might
this quickly.
The basis of might is
to assimilate everything.
In other words, to know all
that is happening around
and the capability of
receiving all the information.
What man fails to see or hear
becomes his weakness.
The aim of might is focus.
The Almighty gave man might
only to teach him how to focus.
If one cannot focus one's might
it is of no use.
In other words,
speed
composure
assimilation
focus.
I am exceedingly pleased
with you, brother Bheem.
Whenever you are
in a battle or struggle
I shall be your might.
I shall always remain
around you inconspicuously.
Your mere bellow had killed
numerous ogres of Lanka.
With your blessing
in the great war,
my bellow
will crush the courage
of the sons of Dhritarashtra!
Indeed, Bheem.
When the Almighty himself
is the charioteer
and justice and righteousness
are the wheels of that chariot
the flag atop it
shall always be blessed by me.
May you be victorious.
It is being announced to
the entire Kuru dynasty
that the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru family Kunti
has given birth to the
heir of the Kuru family.
The one who displays
auspicious characteristics
the one with numerous
positive qualities...
Such a son has been born
in the family of
Emperor Shantanu.
On this happy occasion
King Dhritarashtra himself
will announce the celebrations
in the kingdom.
Subjects of the kingdom
and people present
in the court!
By the grace of God
today, the ancestors
of the Kuru family
would be pleased.
An heir to take forward
the lineage
has been born
into the Kuru family.
I am extremely happy that
my younger brother,
my dear Pandu
got this opportunity to
please the ancestors.
On behalf of the royal family
there should be offerings,
sacraments
and prayers in all
of the kingdom.
There should be abundant
charity and offerings.
Like the sunrise
lights up the world
with happiness
in the same way, may the new
member of the Kuru family
fill the hearts of our subjects
with happiness and bliss...
Such should be
the arrangements.
This is the order of the
Kuru king Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Dhritarashtra!
Hail King Dhritarashtra!
Where is the princess
of Gandhar?
Where is the woman who has
brought misfortune to me?
Your Majesty...
The Queen is sleeping.
She has fallen asleep
with great difficulty.
Then, wake her up!
How can the one who made
my fortune sleep forever
sleep peacefully?
Gandhari!
Lord.
You!
Hundred!
You had promised me a 100
majestic sons, Gandhari!
Where are my 100 children?
Where is the heir to my throne?
The one who would make
my heart content
the one to redeem
me from desperation...
Where is my son?
Where is he, Gandhari?
Lord, I am confident.
The blessings of Lord Shankar*
cannot go in vain.
*A manifestation of meditative Shiva.
But what kind of blessing
has God given you?
A 100 sons who would
win over kingdoms
or a 100 sons who
would serve others?
They would lead
a life of humiliation
their father would lead
a life of humiliation.
Is that the boon
you got?
Had you really got
a boon
or is all of it fabricated?
Why haven't you
delivered yet, Gandhari?
No one can predict
birth and death.
I am not convinced with
the answer, Gandhari.
I have always been
disappointed by you.
Always disappointed!
You mocked me by
blindfolding yourself.
Yet, I didn't remarry.
Look at Kunti!
Pandu married another woman
but still, she gifted
him with a son.
And me?
I gave your respect.
I was considerate
towards your feelings.
I made you the Queen.
Yet, you didn't give me
a son at the right time.
That's why... You haven't gifted
a son at the right time
because...
I have honoured you
more than you deserve.
That was my mistake.
If you had a competitor
you would have delivered
a child by now.
Yes, it was my mistake.
But, Gandhari, I will correct
my mistake very soon.
The way you have hurt me by not
delivering the baby on time
in the same way,
I will do something
which will hurt you
all your life, at each step.
It will hurt you at every step!
It will hurt you at every step.
Lord!
Gandhari.
It isn't good to cry in
such a condition, sister.
What else shall I do, brother?
When the clouds of misfortune
are hovering on me
I will obviously have to cry!
- No, Gandhari!
No!
Don't you think like
that, Gandhari.
You will give birth to a baby,
a blessing of Lord Shiva.
You shouldn't insult God by
addressing it as a misfortune.
Consider it as meditation.
- How long should I meditate?
How long should I wait?
How much more pain
do I have to bear?
The more a tree
stands under the sun
the sweeter its fruits are.
But my husband is
getting impatient.
He cannot be blamed for it.
I have always disappointed
him as a wife.
Only disappointment.
After a long wait
I had attained my
husband's love.
That priceless possession is
slipping out of my hands.
No, Gandhari!
You shouldn't worry
about the king.
He has no control
over his anger.
But he wouldn't dare
to be unjust with you.
Because he knows
that you will be the one to
carry his 100 sons.
And no son
can love and respect a father
who is unjust to his mother.
The king must be aware of it.
Greetings, Queen.
Queen, a guard is here with
a message from the King.
What is the message?
The king has commanded
to go to his room.
But I have taken an oath.
I will not leave the temple
until... - Not you, my Queen.
The order...
What? - The order is for
your head maid.
Is it for Sugadha?
- Yes, Queen.
The King has asked Sugadha
to beautify herself
and come to his room.
The King has ordered Sugadha
to come to his room.
Me?
Why?
Queen, I won't go.
I will not go, Queen.
Is this the idea
the King has come up with
to hurt me all my life?
What are you raving, maid?
Sugadha will not go.
Sugadha will go, brother.
If my husband has
decided to punish me
then, I accept his decision.
But, Gandhari...
- Please leave, Sugadha.
Follow the King's order.
Go, Sugadha.
Sugadha, leave!
Brother, you too should leave.
I need to be alone.
Gandhari, let me
talk to the King.
You shouldn't decide
anything in a rush.
Brother, you should leave!
When someone loses hope
and his desires are shattered
his heart is full of anger.
He tries to punish the person
who he thinks, has
offended him.
But whenever we lose hope and
our desires are shattered
should we always blame
someone else for it?
There can be many reasons why
desires are left unfulfilled.
Some are unfulfilled
due to our fate
and some due to our destiny.
And sometimes, the
desires are such
that they cannot be fulfilled.
Without considering the
circumstances
it isn't right to blame someone.
Instead, it's vengeance.
The basis of justice is mercy
Pity.
And the basis of vengeance
is anger and pride.
It means...
Dealing with someone's offence
without being merciful
or to punish someone...
Isn't that being unfair?
Think for yourself.
What kind of a son are you?
You shouldn't torment
your mother.
What crime are you
punishing me for?
Why have you turned me helpless?
Why have you turned me into
a culprit before my husband?
I have waited for your
birth every moment.
I dreamt about you all the time!
I observed several fasts
for your happiness!
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!
Be the cause!
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!
Be the cause!
Move aside!
Has Gandhari delivered a baby?
What has she delivered?
Is it a son or a daughter?
Answer me!
Has Gandhari delivered a baby?
What has she delivered?
Is it a son or a daughter?
Answer me!
Aryavati. Rambha.
Where is my son?
How is he?
Why can't I hear him cry?
Is he alright?
Where is he?
Answer me!
Why isn't my son next to me?
Take me to my son...
Queen!
My son...
Where is my son?
Where is my son?
Son?
Not a son
you have given birth
to a lump of flesh.
It's the opinion of the penal
council, Your Highness
the losses that these people
have incurred
deems justice mandatory.
Council-Head, please ask them of
the impairments.
Their trust has been impaired,
Your Highness!
They trusted the royal family
and the king to protect them.
Their trust was priceless,
Your Highness.
In order to reinstate the trust
let such wealth be bestowed
upon them, grandsire.
That wouldn't suffice alone,
Your Highness.
In my opinion, the princes
should apologise to them.
This deed will strengthen
their trust in justice
and it will serve as a moral
lesson for the princes too.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Excuse me, Your Highness!
Excuse me...
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
There is no need to worry
anymore, Your Highness!
I was aware that on hearing
about Duryodhan
you'd be quite worried,
Your Highness.
Hence, I hurried over here
so soon, Your Highness.
There is nothing to worry about.
I have already spoken to
the physician, Your Highness.
The wound will heal soon,
Your Highness.
In no time.
What are you rambling about,
Shakuni?
What wound?
Whose wound?
Your beloved Duryodhan's life
is out of danger, Your Highness.
What!
Duryo...
Is Duryodhan wounded?
How?
Answer me, Shakuni.
Who dared spill my son's blood!
The revolt that these fishermen
created, Your Highness
counted in every one of them.
Every one of them was attacking
with a weapon, Your Highness.
Who's weapon it was
that injured Duryodhan
will be impossible to find out,
Your Highness.
Son!
Duryodhan!
Your Highness...
For attacking the prince...
I mean, the attackers of
Prince Duryodhan
should have justice, right?
Justice?
The ones who spilled my son's
blood will have but one fate!
Off with all their heads!
But, Your Highness...
- But, Dhritarashtra.
This would be atrocious.
Justice has been dispensed.
Let the orders be followed.
Forgive us, Your Highness.
Please do not take our lives.
Spare us from a death sentence,
Your Highness!
Forgive us, Your Highness!
Spare us from a death sentence,
Your Highness!
Spare us from a death
sentence, Your Highness!
Spare us from a death sentence,
Your Highness!
Dhritarashtra,
what sort of justice is this?
I have inspected
Duryodhan myself.
He is not grievously wounded
at all.
My son's blood has been spilled,
Queen Mother.
Instead of thinking about
the gravity of their crimes
why are you concerned about
the severity of his wounds?
They have tried to revolt.
They have intended for
the death of the Prince.
Do these crimes seem so
trivial to you, Queen Mother?
Even if the accusations
against them are true
they aren't as grave to effect
a death penalty to so many!
I've been reigning for
many years now, Queen Mother.
I've at least become as wise
to not require your advice.
Wait, Dhritarashtra.
Such stoicism
doesn't befit a ruler.
Your father Shantanu
was always a loving
and kind-hearted ruler.
Not one inspiring fear.
Bhishma.
Bhishma, please
say something to Dhritarashtra.
Right after
the coronation
the king's word holds
as good as the law of the God.
I had told you of the same
earlier itself, Queen Mother.
But I can
appeal to His Highness.
I appeal to you too,
Your Highness.
I appeal to you too.
I may not be a citizen
of the kingdom
yet I appeal, Your Highness.
Please heed her advice.
Your Highness,
you must surely recall
that these fishermen are
Mother Queen's kin.
Punishing them makes her heart
writhe in agony, Your Highness.
Mother Queen hasn't forgotten
her childhood yet.
Prince Shakuni, that's an act of
impudence to the Queen Mother.
How can
reminding one of his/her clan
be a crime, Chief Minister?
Your Highness, so what
have you finally decided?
Keeping in mind
the feelings of Mother Queen
I change my decision,
Chief Minister.
The fishermen are hereby
banished from this province.
Nowhere in the entire
Kuru province
do they have permissions
to reside anymore.
Let the orders be followed.
The Queen Mother
or His Highness
aren't questionable
by us.
But you are my sister,
hence I am asking you this.
When the time came to leave
this land of our ancestors
and if you weren't Queen Mother,
rather a member of our family
would your tears have
been sanguine or not?
Just tell me that.
This land and this water
have but our sweat
seeping and flowing in them.
And after death, they have
but assimilated our very bodies.
Then why
are we being banished from here
in vain, Satya?
Queen Mother?
I...
I'm helpless.
- I know.
Everyone is helpless.
The whole province is helpless.
Today if King Pandu
were on that throne
he wouldn't have
sided with his sons'.
Justice would have been
upheld by him.
And probably
King Pandu's sons wouldn't have
been like these princes, Satya.
A fruit has the taste
which the tree imparts to it.
God knows,
where King Pandu is!
Where are his sons!
Arjun!
Arjun!
Arjun!
Sahadev!
I have found brother Bheem.
Sahadev!
I have found brother Bheem.
Sahadev!
Where is brother Bheem?
Only Nakul can answer
this question.
Nakul
Nakul
Sahadev! Brother Bheem
is behind that rock.
Brother.
Sit.
One for Nakul.
And one for Sahadev.
What are you doing?
Say your prayers first.
So, are you done eating?
Now go and play.
Didn't you just eat?
Didn't I offer you both a 'laddoo'* each?
*A ball-shaped sweet.
Didn't I?
You had, brother Bheem.
But as we closed out eyes
to say our prayers
you devoured our 'laddoo'.
Do you mean to say,
I stole it?
Are you accusing your own
elder brother of stealing?
While you eat it so quick
as if it were the first time!
Aren't you ashamed?
We have just seen them.
We never get to eat them.
It is apt, isn't it?
It isn't appropriate
for kids to eat 'laddoos'.
Eating 'laddoos' can cause
you to fatten up!
Go have the 'sattu'* that mother has prepared for father.
*A foodstuff consisting of a mixture of ground pulses and cereals.
Arjun!
That's my 'laddoo'.
Arjun,
I will beat you up.
Hey, my 'laddoos'.
Brother Yudishtir.
Enough of it.
You three will not eat
even a single 'laddoo'.
Let Bheem eat
all those 'laddoos'.
Elder brother, they snatched off
four of my 'laddoos'.
How can I manage with
just these many 'laddoos'?
Aren't you aware?
Glutton' is my other name.
Have them in peace, Bheem.
Then have some fruits as well.
Here, brother.
We three will eat
half a 'laddoo' each.
If the three of you eat
half a 'laddoo' each
there will still be
half a 'laddoo' left.
Go.
Get that half as well.
Wait, wait.
All three of you
may eat with me.
Sit.
Arjun, Sahadev,
come on.
Brother. Was that love
or an assassination attempt?
I do not understand.
Son Dhritarashtra.
I can tell by your
quivering words
that you are at unrest,
Queen Mother.
But justice isn't necessary to
be as per everyone's comfort.
What you did wasn't justice,
Dhritarashtra.
To be blinded so much
by your love for your son
isn't appropriate.
Are you here to remind me
of my blindness?
No.
I'm here to remind you
that you are a king.
Your foremost responsibility
is towards your subjects.
Whatever happened, wasn't
the subjects' fault at all.
The fault was your son's.
And it wasn't right to punish
the fishermen for his fault.
Return them to their
rightful place. - Queen Mother
I have heard that
the fishes in a pond
love that pond so much
that when the pond dries up,
they die
rather than leave the pond.
But maybe that's
their helplessness.
But what helplessness causes
your life among the fishermen
to be as fresh
in your memories till date?
Haven't you left that past
behind, Queen Mother?
Today I will give you
an advice, Queen Mother.
Please do ponder over it
being in the role you are in.
Not as a fisherman's daughter.
Whoever raises his weapon
againts Hastinaour
shall have to pay the price for it!
You are right, Grandsire!
It isn't your skills that are
being displayed in this battle
but it is your weakness that is exposed.
If you were capable indeed
instead of taking the lives
of your heirs and descendants
you would lay down your own life!
I...
am bound by my duty, Khrisna!
Duties grant liberation!
What duty is this that blinds you instead?
Surely this isn't your duty
but a snare!
A shackle!
Do not question my sense of duty, Khrisna!
In my entire life never for a moment
have I commited injustice!
In order to fulfill the promise I made to
my father I only did what was necessary!
Just for the sake of your duty
you are plunging the whole world into peril!
I do not consider this
the strength of character.
A character is which strives towards
everyone's well being, every moment.
Your character is tainted
and so is your duty!
Khrisna!
You are crossing your limit!
I respect you very much!
But you have no rights
to call one's duties tainted!
My duty is truth!
And therefore, no one can defeat me!
- No one!
- I can defeat you!
I can defeat you this very moment,
Grandsire Bheeshma!
Do not fan the flames of my anger!
There is no such metal
that does not meal in my fire!
And there is no oath, no curse or no blessing
that I cannot violate!
You are being a hindrance to worldly
well being and the course of destiny.
If you do not lay down
your weapons now
I shall surely slay you!
[MUSIC]
I do not even need a weapon to slay you!
I can slay you even
with the wheel of this chariot!
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Khrisna!
Why aren't my arrows able to reach you, Khrisna?
I am not Vasudeva Khrisna!
I am not a Yadava!
I am not even human!
I am the most supreme God, Grandsire!
I am truth, knowledge and justice!
You are fighting only with my permission!
You are alive only with my consent.
And it is with my consent
that you may acquire death!
Please forgive me, Khrisna!
I was unaware of your true form.
You are indeed capable of slaying me.
But in order to slay me,
you are willing to violate you oath.
I must indeed be largely at fault!
What is my fault, Khrisna?
Please tell me!
Your fault is ignorance, Grandsire!
You never tried to comprehend
the true form of justice!
Until the roof of compassion
spans the entire world
until then justice in society
stays incomplete.
But you only thought about your family.
You never thought about worldly well being!
Therefore even your sacrifice
is a form of selfishness.
I renounced royalty for the sake of my father!
I swore to a lifetime of celibacy.
There were no selfish motives for these, Khrisna!
The oath to celibacy and renouncement
of royalty were indeed great deeds!
But why did you give up your responsibility
towards the society, Grandsire?
In order to avoid mutual conflict
within the Kuru clan
and to avoid war in Hastinapur for the throne
and to protect the subjects of
Kuru dynasty from pain.
I took up this oath, Khrisna.
Look all around you, Grandsire?
What is going on here?
Your oath did not avoid
this catastrophe, this war!
Ponder over it, Grandsire!
You treated your oath as your duty!
If it indeed were just
why would this great war occur?
In reality, justice isn't a name
of a forgotten thought.
It isn't the name of any tradition either.
Justice is the name of life!
And life changes constantly!
Changes is the characteristic of life!
And a human must commit deeds
for the sake of change!
Yet you give up on deeds, Grandsire?
But I have acted only appropriately
at every step of life, Khrisna.
No, Grandsire!
In this birth of yours
in order to keep yourself from the ties of actions
you have not truly engaged
in any significant action.
The meaning of actions is taking decisions
and accepting the consequences of one's actions.
But when did you take any decision,
Your Excellency?
Was crowning King Pandu your decision?
A person who is blind since birth
is unworthy of becoming the King.
That is why I suggest
brother Pandu to be crowned the King.
Was having King Dhirtarashtra
and Queen Gandahari married your decision?
On the auspicious occasion of Akshay Tritiya'*
*Hindu holy day, believed to bring good luck and success.
Prince Dhritarashtra shall be married
to Gandahari the Princess of Gandhar.
Why did you not try to stop King Dhritarashtra
from committing unrighteous deed, Your Excellency?
Prince Duryodhan was attacked by these people
and you need to punish them.
That is atrocious.
Just do as I say!
The decision of hosting the game of dice
and that of not stopping the
humalliation of Panchali there...
Grandsire, the whole of the Aryan
region resonates of your glory.
You are the son of Goddess Ganga Herself.
Then despite witnessing such depravity.
How can you even remain quite?!
The decision of waging this war...
To establish righteousness
in the Aryan region again
it is mandatory to wage a war.
In order to stop all these unrighteous deeds not
only did you have the competence but also power.
But you could not take a decision,
Your Excellency.
You remained bound to your oath and vow!
I...
shall live my life as a servant!
The truth is that under the garb of duties
you kept running away
from the responsibilty of taking decisions!
Does taking decisions not forge new ties, Vasudev?
In order to free yourself from various tie and you
tried to understand the principle of selfness acts
then your life would have been filled
with righousness, Your Excellency.
In order to free yourself from ties,
why did you renouce actions altogether?
You could have renounced
the fruits of those actions.
Instead of deeming someone's order to be a duty
you could have deemed your action to be so.
That would have rid you of your ties as well.
You had taken that oath a very long time ago.
Did you know what the future
had in store back then?
Circumstances changed, Your Excellency.
Times changed.
But did you not break your oath.
And neither did you accept any change.
As a result of all that
this war is being waged today.
Then does an oath hold no value?
It indeed does.
An oath that benefits the
entire society indeed holds value.
However, the moment
the oath of a person and his decision
begins to affect the society adversely
then that very instant
it becomes mandatory
to break that oath, Your Excellency.
If fighting from the side of Pandavas
is the decision you cannot take today.
Then at least give up your weapons.
And accept your death.
Today being on the side of the Pandavas
if you cannot take the decision
to engage in battle
at least lay down your weapons
and accept your death!
I accept, Khrisna!
If I had acquired the knowledge
imparted by you earlier
a lot of injustice could be avoided.
But...
even if not in life
at least in death the knowledge
imparted by you will surely be useful.
Death at your hands shall be
a great honour to me.
End me!
I am ready!
As you wish, Grandsire!
No, Khrisna!
You have sworn not to engage in battle!
It is the time to break my oath now, Arjun!
That is why I am breaking my oath!
But, Khrisna, the entire world
shall condemn you then!
Then I shall accept it!
Either way, after this battle
I have to bear may insults
and curse and you are not aware of it.
But I would not feel glad or sad about it!
At this moment, Grandsire's death in inevitable!
No, Khrisna!
Give me an opportunity!
I shall give up all my affection
and defeat Grandsire under 
my circumstances!
But Khrisna do not commit
such a grave sin due to me.
If it happens so because of me
that very moment
I shall die, Khrisna!
Give me an opportunity!
Please heed to my plea!
My death
is pre-ordained at the hands
of Princess Amba of Kashi.
And ought to that reason
Princess Amba is born as Shikhandini!
Let only her have the privilege
of slaying me, Khrisna!
I promise!
I promise, Khrisna.
I shall wait for her!
And the day when she faces me
on the battlefield
I shall lay down all my weapons!
Until then
I shall surely protect the soldiers of Hastinapur!
But none of your soldiers
shall die at my hands!
This is neither my duty
nor anyone's orders!
This is my decision, Khrisna!
A fiery glowing visage
a torrid vigour
and a fervent soul define
your daughter, father.
This boon from the very gods
pays you her respects.
There's no need to
touch my feet.
The boon from the gods
can't be kept at my feet
and I, Drupad, doesn't let
anyone rule over him.
Then I have
just one apt place left.
That would be your heart.
Let's go, Dhrishtadyumna.
Panchal and I, your father,
have waited long for you.
You have to fulfil the oath
of your father soon.
Definitely, father.
Draupadi
I am your sister, Shikhandini.
Isn't father
happy about my birth?
When the sky is overcast
the sunlight doesn't lighten
up the earth.
His nous
is now clouded with rage.
But in due time
father will surely come to know
that you are the fortune
of Panchal.
Come on.
The customary bathing ritual
is at hand.
Follow me, Draupadi.
Draupadi!
Draupadi!
This is your room.
All the females of
the royal palace stay here.
Attendants!
Draupadi's customary bath
needs the bath to be prepped.
Panchkavya',* sandalwood paste,
*"Mixture of five products."
perfumed oil and others
must be arranged there.
Sushma go and get the
offerings made
to Goddess Parvati
from the temple.
Anuradha, arrange for clothes
and jewellery for the princess.
Princess, you collided with
the mirror knowingly, right?
Draupadi this is a mirror.
Who is this?
That's your reflection.
Panchal's most beautiful woman.
That's you, Draupadi.
Princess, don't you even know
what a mirror is?
Draupadi
all the gods have bestowed you
with every form of knowledge.
But not of those objects
that were made by man, not God.
Come on. Your customary bath's
time is at hand.
Draupadi
after the bath the attendants
will groom you.
Post that, we'd set out to
visit Goddess Parvati's temple.
I'll be back after arranging
the bodyguards and palanquin.
Malini how dare you
jest with the Princess!
Beg her pardon.
- Why so?
I wasn't miffed.
As you say, Princess.
But the progeny of attendants
should mind their limits.
Limits are defined by
one's disposition.
That's decided by one
[himself] herself.
One that ought to be minded
isn't a limit but a prohibition.
What are you holding?
It's a dolly.
What would you do with it?
I would get her married
with a nice and handsome doll.
All the girls have a dolly.
Have you never seen one?
Malini the Princess
was never a child.
She was born a youth.
She appeared out of the flames
of a 'yajna'.
She hasn't passed childhood.
What happens in childhood?
It's full of joy, Princess.
The entire world seems like
a curious puzzle to be solved.
There's no joy!
Mother keeps hitting me.
Always pointing out faults
and bossing me around.
I just wish to grow up soon.
Okay, then.
Fine.
You become my friend
and make me experience childhood
and when I come to know
how it feels to be a grownup
I will let you know.
So?
Would you be my friend?
But, Princess
she's an attendant's daughter.
An attendant's daughter can't
be friends with a Princess.
Really?
But we are friends!
Because we both can't understand
that difference.
She's so pretty!
- You are very pretty!
Even more
than this dolly of mine.
My dolly will marry
a handsome doll.
You too must get married
to a handsome prince, Princess.
How dare you snatch
the prince's weapon?
Dushasan, you fool!
It isn't courage,
it is training.
Even if the teacher's son
is younger to us
it's right to consider
him as an elder brother.
Our uncle had said so.
But he is elder to us in age.
Accept my greetings, friend.
You seem cultured.
I was afraid
that I may have to force
the princes of Hastinapur
to change their attitude.
What is the pearl on
your forehead?
It is the center of my sharp
brains and limitless powers.
It's the fruit of the penance
I did in my previous birth.
Due to this
I will never fall sick
or grow old.
Then being friends with a great
Brahman like you
will be a blessing to the
future king of Hastinapur.
My uncle has made all
these arrangements for me.
Hereafter, you will have equal
rights on all these things
as much as I have.
A lamp burning with
perfumed oil?
Such great facilities!
Life at the palace is
actually very comfortable.
This is nothing.
The day you become the Royal
teacher of Hastinapur
there will be abundance
of facilities.
Your friend promises you.
Food can be served
on a golden plate
but one cannot cook in it.
No facilities are allowed
for the students
of this hermitage.
It's human nature
that he wants himself,
his family and his children
to get all the happiness.
That's why we always
stay away from
hard work and problems.
We try to increase our
comforts and facilities.
Think about your life.
Isn't it true
that we always provide
our children
with comforts and facilities?
But have you ever thought?
How would comforts benefit them?
The ones who are provided
with comforts and facilities
how would their lives be!
Hard work makes the body
healthier.
When our brains encounter
tough challenges
it becomes more radiant.
We have experienced it.
But we tend to forget
that when our heart and
soul experience difficulties
even they become stronger.
It means
whenever we try to keep
our children away
from hard work and sorrow
aren't we actually shutting the
door to happiness for them?
Think about it.
Ashwathama.
Ashwathama!
Son.
These lovely clothes and gold
why are you putting them
in the fire?
I am following my
father's orders.
Did your father
ask you to burn all the gifts
received from Hastinapur?
But your father had decided
to renounce poverty
for your sake, son.
But not from his heart, mother.
Poverty is still very
dear to him.
I think he wants
me to be miserable and
lead my life begging for alms.
Why is that, mother?
What is the pride in assuming
liquid flour to be milk?
Why does father hate prosperity?
Today, I was being friends with
the prince of Hastinapur.
The prince would be the future
king of Hastinapur.
Beings friends with him
could have filled my life with
all the comforts and facilities.
But father
shut the door of that
friendship for me.
Son, there are four
types of friendship.
The best form of friendship is
where everyone together
with knowledge, devotion
and principles
work hard for the welfare
of one's soul.
The second best form of
friendship is when
all the friends together
think about their families,
dynasty
the society and the
welfare of the nation.
The third is the
friendship of business
where efforts are put
to earn wealth
together.
The last is the friendship
of vices
where attempts are made
only to enjoy.
What kind of a friendship do
you share with the Kuru prince?
What benefits would you derive
from such a friendship?
What have I derived
in life until now
that I can chose?
- Ashwathama!
Don't you talk like that
to your father.
Let him speak, Kripi.
I understand his feelings.
But son, you must remember
he is being friends with you now
because you are
his Guru's son.
I trusted such a friendship and
had a bitter experience in life.
You had a bitter experience
because you had huge
expectations, lord.
Ashwathama is only...
- Only?
Are you using the word only?
What does he want?!
The best clothing?
Gold ornaments?
Or does he want to be
served a grand feast every day?
Would he be satisfied with that?
You seem to forget
he is the grandson of
the great sage Bharadwaj
and the son of the disciple
of the great Parshuram.
He has to become great.
He has a right to the throne.
The throne of Panchal.
I will crown you
king of Panchal.
This is your father's
promise, son.
It's a promise.
Until I do not crown you
king of Panchal
I won't be able to forget
the humiliation I'd endured.
How would that happen?
Among all the Kuru princes
who is capable of doing this?
Wake up.
Wake up!
- Go away, servant.
Not now.
We will wake up
after four hours.
The rats didn't let us sleep
throughout the night.
Go away.
Wake up!
- Sire!
Wake up, elder brother.
The teacher is here.
Let me sleep. I haven't
completed my sleep yet.
Wake up!
- Sire!
The one who can sleep like a dog
and wake up immediately
is called a student.
Everyone should assemble
in the garden. Quickly!
Students.
A new life begins for
all of you today.
Nothing is more important in
life than getting an education.
The first day of acquiring
knowledge is more important
than any other day in your life.
Today, it will be decided
what will all of your learn
in the coming years
and how much knowledge
you will gain.
There on the branch of the tree
a wooden bird has been placed.
It's eye has to be pierced
with your arrow.
Yudhistir, you are
the eldest of them all
so step forward.
Aim at your target.
What do you see?
I can see a tree, Sire.
The branch on the tree
and I can see the bird
sitting on the branch.
There are other branches
which has a birds nest on it.
I have to be careful when
I shoot the arrow
that the nest should not fall.
If the branch falls along
with the bird
there is an ant hill down there.
It may break.
I have to be careful
about it too.
That's amazing, dear.
You can see so many
things at a time.
This is the first quality
needed in a good ruler
which is naturally
inculcated in you.
But you cannot become an archer.
Place the bow down
and go back to your place.
Bheem!
Step forward.
Aim at the target.
What do you see?
The elder brother has created
a problem for me, Sire.
Whatever brother had seen,
I see the same things.
And
many fruits.
You could see so many things
but you couldn't see whether
the string on your bow is tied.
Should I tie it?
- Of course.
Go around the entire hermitage
a hundred times.
And then tie the string.
Hurry up!
Duryodhan, step forward.
Aim at your target.
Duryodhan, step forward.
Aim at your target.
What do you see?
I can only see the bird
and the branch of the
tree, Sire.
What should I drop?
The bird or the branch?
The eye of the bird
placed on the branch
has to be pierced in a way
that the bird doesn't
fall from the tree.
How is that possible, Sire?
An attack will surely
have an aftermath.
Until there is no control
on the aftermath
until there is no control on
the level of the aftermath
a warrior doesn't attack.
Place the bow down.
Go back to your place.
That's surprising.
There is no one among
the Kuru princes
who can pierce the bird's eye.
Father had taught
that to me first.
Arjun.
Aim at the target.
What do you see?
I can only see
the bird's eye, Sire.
Shoot the arrow.
I command you,
grandfather
to follow Yudhishthir
and protect Hastinapur.
As soon as you
get an opportunity
slay Yudhishthir.
Charioteer, proceed
towards Hastinapur.
Friend
it's time to take
the third step.
It is time to extract
your brother Duryodhan
from Guru Drona's protection.
Of course, Madhav.
Commander Dhrishtadyumna
is busy with that task.
Release the spheres of fire!
Attack the unit
releasing the spheres of fire!
Attack!
Soldiers, get ready to attack.
Attack only once Guru Drona
reaches us.
Guru Drona has started attacking
Commander Dhrishtadyumna.
And Commander Dhrishtadyumna
will be able to stop
Guru Drona,
only for a short while.
Friend
we need to bring Guru Drona
towards you.
This is the fourth step
towards victory.
Guru Drona's only weakness
is his son.
Once I attack Ashwatthama
Guru Drona will come to me
voluntarily, Madhav.
And then
no one will be there
to protect Prince Duryodhan.
Neither His Excellency Bhishma
nor Guru Drona.
Nakul and Sahadev will clear
brother Bheem's path
to Prince Duryodhan.
The last stage of our victory
will be completed
when brother Bheem
kills Prince Duryodhan.
Kill?
Kill my Duryodhan!
No.
What kind of a plan is this,
Sanjay?
I... Anyhow, I need to send
this message to Duryodhan.
Yes!
We are very far away
from the battlefield
Your Highness.
- But...
But my son's life
is in danger, Sanjay.
I am feeling
very restless.
Do something, Sanjay.
Do something quickly.
The great sage Ved Vyas
blessed me with divine sight.
The pain born as a result
of that divine sight
will have to be borne by us,
Your Highness.
But how will I bear the pain
of my son's death?
Tell me what is happening
on the battlefield.
Who is there near him,
to protect him?
Tell me.
King Dhrupad
Guru Drona's son Ashwatthama
has always dreamt
of defeating me.
He should get an opportunity
to fulfil his wish.
I challenge you!
Select the weapon
of your choice, Ashwatthama.
Yudhishthir
you would be committing a sin
by attacking
the fort of Hastinapur.
And you must have
enough faith in me
to know that I never sin.
Then are you going
on a pilgrimage
by leaving Kurukshetra?
Catching a glimpse of you
is akin to going
on a pilgrimage, for me.
Today, this is my place
of pilgrimage, grandsire.
I was not going
to attack Hastinapur.
I am only proceeding
towards Hastinapur
as per Vasudev's strategy.
But I have received news
that you plan to attack.
You never lie.
When did I lie?
That I am proceeding
towards Hastinapur
to mount an attack...
This false news was circulated
by Vasudev.
I never said so, grandsire.
Vasudev must have been aware
that Duryodhan would get scared
and surely
command me to proceed
towards Hastinapur.
Yes, grandsire.
This is what is Vasudev's
strange strategy.
And now, you will have
to fight me and my army.
I will not be able to emerge
victorious against you
but I will surely fight you.
Guru Drona!
Your son Ashwatthama's life
is in danger.
He is battling Prince Arjun.
None of the students
of Guru Drona
are capable enough
to defeat him.
And as long as I am alive
my son's life
can never be in danger.
Guru Drona!
Friend...
the longer
you keep
Guru Drona occupied...
The longer brother Yudhishthir
keeps His Excellency Bhishma
away from the battlefield...
The better the chances
of brother Bheem
defeating Prince Duryodhan.
The final stage of our strategy
and our final step
towards victory
now depend on you,
brother Bheem
and brother Yudhishthir.
Just keep him occupied.
Get brother Bheem
as much time
as you can.
Duryodhan!
Have you become a coward
or have you lost
your self-confidence?
Come on! Fight me!
MY child!
My child
do not act foolishly.
Do not be a fool
by rising to his bait.
A smart warrior does not just
accept a challenge.
He does so at the right time.
Uncle
I shall crush this worm.
Possible, but not inevitable.
And his Excellency Bhishma
is absent from the battlefield
at this moment.
In this situation,
you should not
accept this challenge.
Soldiers, attack!
Soldiers, attack!
Duryodhan!
If you are really strong
face me on the battlefield.
Think about the prestige
of your clan.
You are shaming
all our ancestors
and our descendents.
Our ancestors in heaven
are hiding their faces in shame.
They are ridiculing
your parents!
Father
this is Vasudev's strategy.
I need to leave
at the earliest
to protect my friend
Duryodhan.
None of your strategies
will be successful, Arjun.
You cannot leave
without completing the fight.
What sort of a eunuch
has your mother
given birth to?
- Bheem!
Why did you declare war
when you fear death?
Come on, Duryodhan!
Rub your head on my feet.
Are you a Kshatriya
or a eunuch?
Bheem!
Queen Kunti.
Upon your arrival in Hastinapur,
I wanted to be the first one
to welcome you
with these lotuses.
The truth is...
My heart never abandoned
that desire.
Whenever I see lotuses
I am reminded of your feet,
Queen.
If you stand silently like this
I shall consider that you have
not accepted this flower, Queen.
But
flowers are offered
only to sages
and at the feet of the Almighty.
I am not worthy of this.
But are mothers not another
form of the Almighty, Queen?
And my father had taught me
in my childhood
that the king and the queen
are the father and mother
of the subjects.
That is why, as a child,
I had the desire
to convey to Queen Kunti of
all the injustice done to me
so that she would help me
get justice as my mother.
When my own mother has forsaken
me for the fear of the society
then what can I expect
from anyone else?
What do you mean?
Just now, my mother
has refused to reside with me
in my palace, Queen.
Goodbye.
Son.
You...
You may think of me
as your mother.
I did not come to the palace
to look for a new mother, Queen.
My mother has forsaken me.
But I have not forsaken her.
This was just an old wish
that I fulfilled today.
Besides
by calling the mother
of my arch enemy
as my own, I do not wish to let
the fire of my enmity die out.
Why this enmity, son?
I...
I saw you in the arena.
You are a remarkable warrior.
You and Arjun are archers
of equal skills.
We are not equals.
I am a more superior archer
than your son.
And this enmity stems
from the fact
that the place Arjun
was given today in the arena
is mine.
And the place where
you are to be seated
I would never wish
to be seated there.
I have no place at
the feet of Prince Duryodhan.
In other words, you may
deem me as your competitor
but I do not deem you as mine.
Arjun.
Arrogance corrodes valour
as mercury corrodes gold.
Are you telling all this
to brother Arjun
or to the King of Anga Pradesh,
Karna?
What is the point of saying so
to King of Anga Pradesh, Nakul?
Mercury corrodes gold
and not iron.
And where valour is nothing
but a few fancy tricks
it is termed not as gold
but iron.
Iron.
Sahadev.
Do not use
such insulting language.
Karna...
King of Anga Pradesh, Karna,
is your
elder brother...
He is like your elder brother.
Indeed, mother.
He is just like our
elder brother Duryodhan.
King of Anga Pradesh
is just like him.
The same arrogance
and the same ignorance.
You are correct, mother.
He is just like him.
There is no difference, mother.
And our weapons
shall not differentiate either.
Arjun!
Stay within your limits.
King of Anga Pradesh,
you are welcome here.
Neither are we angry with you
nor do we bear
any feeling of competition.
But I do.
I have a reason to be both angry
and have the competitive spirit.
Oh Princes, who cherish
their birth as their ornaments
do remember
that in the actual battlefield
all will know the truth
about their valour and birth.
And Arjun.
If we ever cross paths
in the battlefield someday
then you will be destined
to die at my hands.
I give you my word.
If we ever cross paths
in the battlefield someday
then you will be destined
to die at my hands.
I give you my word.
Warriors are bound to cross each
other's paths in the battlefield
King of Anga Pradesh.
And not in a village fair.
And as for your promise
I shall remind you myself
about it.
Let's go, mother.
My son!
My son, Duryodhan.
Hearing of your prowess today
gave me great solace, son.
The earth was trembling today
with the sound of your feet.
The sound of your mace
felt as though
there were a battle
between the clouds, son.
Greetings.
After all, you have given
elder brother such a name.
He is Duryodhan!
Fighting him
will not be easy.
You are correct, Dusshasan.
Besides
the companionship and
protection of his 99 brothers
will always be with Duryodhan.
The truth is,
Duryodhan is invincible.
And your sons are inarguably
the most superior, father!
Go on, son.
Greetings, grandfather.
May you be prosperous, Prince.
Had there been a verdict
to today's competition
then the words of His Highness
would have seemed true.
There was no verdict?
I defeated four of the Pandavas
before everyone, grandfather.
The warrior left standing
at sundown
was not you.
It was not Prince Arjun either,
Your Excellency.
The King of Anga Pradesh,
Karna, was standing before him.
Undefeated.
- That is why, this competition
did not have any verdict.
- But grandfather
that undefeated warrior
is on my side now.
My friend and my associate.
In other words, my side
is more powerful right now.
And, Your Excellency
my beloved nephew has proved
that he is not only
a fine warrior
but also has the capacity
to become a fine prince.
By declaring Karna
as the King of Anga Pradesh
he brought governance
to the kingdom of Anga
he surrounded the enemy kingdom
of Magadha
and magnified his strength
and that of his kingdom greatly.
Alliance and sabotage
Duryodhan has knowledge
of both these concepts.
Your Excellency
even a prince is required
to perform these duties.
Physical might is not the only
requirement to rule a kingdom.
You are correct, uncle!
In order to protect themselves
from the lion
the small and weak animals
of the jungle
had made an army once.
Our teacher had narrated
such a tale to us.
The ones who do not have
strength in their limbs
only they speak of alliances,
uncle.
Greetings, your Majesty.
May you live long, son.
To know about the strength
of my limbs
you can inquire
the four brothers of yours
who got a taste of the ground
of the arena today.
You are right.
We did get just a taste of it.
Tomorrow, I will eat and digest
the whole of the arena.
And if you wish
to see it for yourself
then be present in the arena.
My name is Vrakodar.
Vrakodar.
Calm down, Bheem!
The competition
has now ended, son.
Now, expunge the thoughts of
the competition from your mind.
May all of you be prosperous!
Today's competition
was only about physical might.
No other capabilities
were being tested today.
That is why, this competition
did not have a verdict.
Today, the princes who
took part in this competition
and displayed their art
have brought contentment
to all of us.
If no verdict could be reached
then have the competition
held again tomorrow, father.
I am willing to participate.
Let it be, brother Duryodhan.
No verdict could be reached
for the competition today.
If the verdict for
the competition is out tomorrow
then you will be
defamed greatly.
Allow us to leave now, uncle.
Allows us to start the battle
or order us to put down
our hands!
Brother, if grandsire do not give 
his approval for battle,
will you put down your weapon?
Indeed!
Sire!
Issue an order to give up!
Sire! You know that 
in this battlefield
the right to issue orders
on behalf of my father
has been given to me!
Heed my order
and get them to give up!
This is an order from the chief commander!
- Duryodhana!
My body is bound to serve
Hastinapur throne!
My heart is bound 
and so too my mind...
But my mind is constrained by my duty.
Only my soul is free
like any other souls!
My soul can't issue
command or permission!
That very soul can 
give rise to both curse
or gift.
Sons of Pandu!
I bestow my blessings to you!
In this war
punish all your enemies to death!
Uphold justice!
Go forward and kill me!
May you be victorious!
Please, your majesty!
Your majesty!
Her Majesty has organized 'Mrityunjay'* chant...
*Special mantra for Mahadev/Shiva.
Majesty, tread carefully!
Her Majesty has hosted
a 'Mrityunjay
and offerings of milk!
Even in unknown surroundings,
I've never tripped.
But, these days...
My own royal chamber is like getting 
in my way, Sanjay!
It is evident today
that in the truest sense
I have turned blind,
Sanjay!
Today, in the truest sense
I have turned blind.
Brother!
Great Sage Vyas has arrived!
Greetings, great sage!
- May you be prosperous!
Gandhari!
Great sage!
Today I long to hear
a few words from you!
Please help me reassure my heart.
I don't have any knowledge on how
to instill courage in yourself,
Majesty.
I'm just here to deliver
an unfortunate news.
Her majesty Satyavati
unfortunately has passed away!
Oh sage!
Her majesty's passed away!
- Yes, Vidur!
Animals and birds
afraid of the dark.
Therefore, they close their eyes
when the sun sets.
Now the whole Aryan clan
and Kuru dynasty
will sink into a terrible darkness!
I have a request, your majesty,
that it is time for you to move on 
for the next world!
Her majesty was the ruler
of the Kuru dynasty.
Therefore I have brought
her urn.
Here,
please accept it, Dhritarashtra.
You will receive more of
such ash urn, majesty!
Her majesty Satyavati leads a good life, that's 
why she has a long life.
Why is your hands are shaking while
receiving her urn?
Learning this news, how can you bear
the death of countless youth?
What will be my sons' fate,
sage?
Who will win
in this war?
What is the future
of the Kuru dynasty?
I want to know, great sage!
We sculpt our future
with our past, majesty!
If you want to know the future
then comprehend this moment.
Understand it,
then you will finally know the future.
If you desire to witness this battle
I will grant you a divine vision!
Come and sit right here,
you can watch what is happening at Kurukhsetra.
No, great sage!
No!
I do not have the courage like that anymore.
Gandhari
do you want to have this divine vision?
No, great sage!
With the oath that I had made,
I have not witnessed joy
throughout life.
So, now
why would I watch
the face of death?
I...
I've cloaked myself
with the veil of hope!
So I do not need to 
face realities!
So...
So I do not need to know the truth!
Vidur
do you want to have this divine vision?
I'm sorry, great sage!
If I wanted to watch
destruction
I will surely now present
on the battlefield.
Great sage!
If you feel that it is fate,
then please grant me with 
that divine vision,
through Sanjay.
I will hear the progress
of battle from him.
Sanjay!
- Yes, Your Majesty!
Always sow the seeds of enmity,
always satisfied with arrogance, 
that is who you are, majesty.
Maybe it is time for you to 
witness the results of it all.
This vision seems like enemy to the other eyes,
am I right, majesty?
Sanjay, I give you
this divine vision.
Vasudev!
Krishna...
Before the conch is blown
I want to check the army
from both sides.
Please drive the chariot slowly 
in between of the two armies!
What do you want to see, Arjun?
To which direction will you see?
And what do you want to confirm?
Today, why do you want
to observe the whole army in the battlefield?
I want to observe the enemy's army, Krishna!
And my own troops as well.
I want to know
in this war, whose death
will establish justice,
and whose death will uphold injustice.
I just want to know
what would I accomplish in this terrible war
and what would I lose.
You have made sacrifice just coming 
to this battlefield, Arjun.
So, why do you ponder over
gains and losses in vain?
A charity is one
where the donor loses
and seekers profit.
But the sacrifice is one
where donors give and all the world benefit!
However, Madhav!
I'm not here for charity.
Countless soldiers here are to lay down their lives.
I want to make sure
if in this great battle
whether I would
destroy injustice
or along I will jeopardize justice too.
You will do all of this now, Arjun?
Do you have the power of creation and destruction?
Supreme God himself effects creation 
and destruction, Arjun!
You are a mere means!
Why do you intend to bear
responsibility to yourself
and let your vanity grows?
I have told you, Arjun!
People who learn the fact that he 
does not own anything
is one to achieve something important!
Maybe you forgot.
Therefore see it, Arjun!
Go ahead and look
what you want to!
Because if the donor's hand tremble 
before doing charity,
actions are not taken into account
in the truest sense!
The King of Magadh, Jarasandh
by having his daughter married
to the Prince of Mathura, Kans
has surrounded us.
Now between Magadh
and our kingdom
there is just one
big kingdom, Panchal.
Its neighbouring kingdoms
are Virat, Kashi and Kaushal
and their kings do not have
the might to stop Jarasandh.
But we have
our allies in the South.
The most powerful kingdom
in the south is Vidarbha.
But Vidarbha is an ally
of Magadh.
- Pandu
when you set out
on your victory march
you shall face hostility
from many kings.
If you do not do so
Jarasandh will
deem you powerless
and attack our kingdom
some day or the other.
Greetings, grandsire.
May you live long.
Greetings, Kripacharya.
- May you live long.
Greetings, Queen Mother.
All of you are discussing
a very serious topic.
To dispense sound advice
to the king
the entire assembly
is present here.
Greetings, brother.
We have a pressing problem
at hand, brother.
We need your assistance.
In other words, does
the king require my services?
Then what was the need to have
grandsire call me here?
I would have been here
even if you had summoned me
Your Highness.
I can only request to you,
brother
but never order you.
Irrespective of when
the skies thunder
animals are bound
to run for cover.
Similarly, the request of a king
is like an order.
So, tell me, Your Highness.
Have you sentenced me
to the gallows
or given me life imprisonment?
Son, what are you saying?
Why would you be punished?
For my crime of being
the elder brother, Queen Mother.
Being the elder brother
to a king
is no less than a crime.
Listen to me, brother.
Expunge your heart
of bitterness and anger.
Vidur and I feel...
And even grandsire
and Queen Mother agree
to make you the Prime Adviser
of Hastinapur.
This rank will be above
that of a Chief Minister.
But no such rank exists,
Your Highness.
Will such a rank be formed
only for me?
Even if it is, it is pointless.
What advice can
a blind man dispense?
The darkness of his vision
clouds his intellect as well.
Am I right, Chief Minister?
Brother...
- Let it be, Pandu.
Let it be.
When I was a child
I would cry to see the moon.
Then mother Ambika would place
a jaggery 'laddoo' in my hand
and tell me that the 'laddoo
was better than the moon.
She would say that people
could only see the moon
but I was fortunate enough
to be able to eat the sweet.
I am not a child anymore.
So, I do not
require this 'laddoo'.
But I do have question
in my mind.
The coronation ceremony is
like a 'yajna'* in the 'shastras'**
* Sacrificial offering.
** Sacred texts.
and righteousness dictates
such a 'yajna
to be performed
only by a married man.
Grandsire
I was denied my right
based on righteousness.
So... - But brother,
Shandilya Samhita' says...
Let it be, Chief Minister.
According to you, righteousness
changes according to situations.
You will quote an unknown
shastra' to us all now.
But for me,
tradition is righteousness
and not just the'shastras'.
It is tradition
that one gets one's right
but only after
proving one's competence.
And in our family, we all
have enlisted our competencies
and Pandu has even proven
the same.
Do you understand all this,
Chief Minister?
Even I did not
understand anything.
I shall definitely
prove my competence, brother.
If you like you may test me.
Only time tests a person, Pandu.
And I am not time
but only a person
who has to it.
Before performing your duties
as the king, get married
to a maiden, Pandu,
who's progeny
will provide security
to Hastinapur in the future.
Just like the progeny of
the Princess of Gandhar.
Is a devoted wife not
a part of a king's competence
Chief Minster?
Goodbye.
Dhritarashtra has raised a doubt
regarding righteousness.
What should I answer him?
For the injustice done to him
will he exact revenge
at every step of the way?
Righteousness can never
lead to injustice, Queen Mother.
But in Dhritarashtra's
perspective
what happened to him was unjust.
And even Gandhari's brother
has stayed back.
He seems deceitful
and devious to me, Bhishma.
He is bound to
instigate Dhritarashtra
and make him a rebel.
If two walls are at loggerheads
then the ceiling
is bound to collapse.
If Pandu and Dhritarashtra
go against each other
then the Kuru dynasty
wall fall apart.
I cannot let this happen.
To keep King Shantanu's kingdom
as an integrated entity
I have gone
through a lot of pain.
Bhishma, we must put an end
to Dhritarashtra's doubt.
Then we should get Pandu
married at the earliest.
Where will we find a maiden
who will bless Hastinapur
with eminent heirs?
Whose sons will secure
the future of Hastinapur.
Whose presence will magnify
the strengths of Pandu.
Where can we find such a maiden?
Princess, why did you
break our arrows?
Did we make a mistake,
Princess Kunti?
It was not a mistake
but a crime.
That deer has a baby.
Did none of you see it?
To snatch its mother
from a child
is the gravest crime.
A child separated
from its mother is not
surrounded by the world
but only fear.
All around it...
The King has sent you a message.
He has asked you to return
to the palace at once.
Why?
The day of your 'swayamvar
has been decided.
Swayamvar?
Greetings, father.
You are back.
Come here.
Father
have you announced
my 'swayamvar' already?
Yes, dear.
With great pride,
I have made this announcement.
You will see,
this 'swayamvar' of yours
will be celebrated
like a festival.
But father...
- No, Kunti.
If the term 'but' is applied
to the beginning of a question
then its answer
is always doubtful.
A good task is never begun with
terms like 'ifs' and 'buts'.
But what if
the heart is filled with fear
while executing that task?
Even then the task
cannot be executed, father.
This is what you had said.
Are you afraid
of the 'swayamvar'?
Why, dear?
With your purity and devotion
you had pleased sage Durvasa.*
Incarnation of Shiva.
Then what are you afraid of,
Kunti?
There...
There is something, father
that keeps
tormenting my heart.
What is it, Kunti?
Only crime
can torment the heart.
And I have complete faith
that my daughter
can never commit a crime.
Something that would
tarnish my reputation
is not something my daughter
is capable of.
Then what keeps tormenting you?
Father...
I had...
After I leave
who will take care of you?
My brother is still a child.
- My dear.
You have taken
enough care of me.
Now you shall worry
only for your husband.
Be calm.
Dream of happier times ahead.
I have complete faith
that the most able man
of this world
the very finest of them all,
will become your husband.
That is why only the best
kingdoms in the region of Arya
have been invited
to the 'swayamvar'.
It is an invitation from
King Kuntibhoj, Queen Mother.
He is organising a 'swayamvar
for his daughter Kunti.
I think, Queen Mother,
we should accept his invitation.
She is not even
the daughter of King Kuntibhoj.
She is the daughter of
Shurasen of the Yadavas.
King Kuntibhoj has adopted her.
If she is not even a princess
then how can she become
the Queen of Hastinapur?
Queen Mother
a mango sapling is taken
from where it was sown
to another piece of land.
And the new piece of land
makes the mango even sweeter.
This maiden belongs to both
the Yadava and Kunti dynasties
and has their virtues too.
And Queen Mother,
with this marriage
our relations with the kingdoms
of Kunti and Yadava
will get strengthened.
Chief Minister Vidur.
Right now, I have no interest in
strengthening our relations.
Right now, I am
in search of a maiden
who has the competence
of becoming Hastinapur's Queen.
I have heard that
this maiden had served
Sage Durvasa for months
and her service was such that
even a short-tempered sage like
Durvasa was pleased with her.
A maiden who can perform
such a difficult task
must have the virtues
of patience and righteousness
inside her, Queen Mother.
Princess
what were you about to tell
to His Highness?
That
the daughter whom he
deems to be pure and chaste
has an
unspeakable secret inside her.
It is a secret which, before
the kings of the region of Arya
can humiliate you
and ruin your reputation.
His Highness has
boundless faith in you.
What will you achieve
by breaking that faith?
That was a mistake in your past.
There is no point
in remembering it.
Please forget about it.
How can I forget about it?
How do I forget about it,
Priyamvada?
Even today, that memory
sends chills down my spine.
I am very pleased with
your service, Princess Kunti.
Before I release you
from my service
I, sage Durvasa,
give you a mantra
with which you will be
able to invoke any God
and call him to you
and shall be blessed with a son
by that God.
Thank you, sire.
I accept your invitation, Kunti.
Are...
Are you Lord Surya himself?
- Yes, Kunti.
Greetings.
This mantra is the order
of Sage Durvasa himself.
When you chant this mantra
while taking the name of a God
that God will be
compelled to appear before you.
Then how did I not get burnt?
I have regulated my temperature
according to you, Kunti.
The son you are
about to conceive
will similarly have
my energy and luminescence.
Son?
Sire.
How... How did you
achieve this, sire?
Did this question
arise out of amazement
or from the desire
to learn the art?
Can I also perform
such a wondrous deed?
Your grandsire
will answer that question.
Show this ball
to him with the stick I made
using blades of grass.
Attention!
King Dhritarashtra
is making his entrance!
Your Highness
there are seven vital topics
to be discussed in the court.
In the northern region,
there is severe water shortage
and in the south...
- The most vital topic
is the punishment
given to the princes.
Excluding the revered teacher
Kripacharya
all the other court members
need to vacate the court.
Your Highness
seeing their impudence, I felt
that it was necessary
to punish them.
Indeed, grandsire.
The question does not pertain
to your decision.
The question is as to
what was the reason
that led to friction between
Pandu's sons and mine.
In what manner
do Pandu's sons behave
that Duryodhan's anger
knows no bounds?
Your Highness!
Character is truly tested
when one has relationships
with unfamiliar people.
Until now, Kunti
and Queen Gandhari's sons
were unfamiliar with one another
but now that they are living
under the same roof
then how one acts
is reflective
of one's character.
In other words,
only my sons are flawed here!
Is this what you mean,
grandsire?
Dhritarashtra!
Your Highness...
Love for family is apt only when
it acts as an armour.
If that love becomes a weapon
then problems may arise.
Your Highness, perhaps
the familial love has made
the princes impudent.
The scriptures and traditions
instruct us, Your Highness
that princes should gain wisdom
by residing in seminaries.
The capability
of testing my sons
lies with which 'Brahmin',
Vidur?
There should be
a capable 'Brahmin
or a knower of
scriptures and weaponry
who can leave the court of Kuru
in awe with his capabilities.
Arjun.
Why did you enter the court
without permission?
Pardon me, sire.
I wished to show this
to grandsire.
Brother Bhim.
Where are brother Yudhishthir,
Arjun and our other brothers?
Brother Yudhishthir
is practising 'yoga'.
Nakul and Sahadev
have gone with him.
Arjun has gone
to the royal court.
You need just me
if you wish to duel.
No, no. We have not come here
to engage in a duel.
We have brought some fruits
for the five of you.
There is a beautiful place
just a few yards from here.
It is called Praman Koti.*
*Pramanakoti was a beautiful spot on the banks of Ganges, north of Hastinapura.
The fruits that grow
in the jungle there
are extremely sweet.
We have brought some for you.
Delicious.
Did I not tell you,
brother Bhim?
Let us go.
Today we have organised
a feast for all of you
in Praman Koti.
For us?
- Yes.
We did not welcome you
the right way.
That was our mistake,
brother Bhim.
You all are our brothers.
To give you respect and love
is our duty.
It took you quite some time
to learn this, Duryodhan.
One learns only with time,
brother Bhim.
It would be better if we make up
for our past mistakes.
Today, we 105 brothers
will jubilate in Praman Koti.
Indeed. Let me go call
brother Yudhishthir and Arjun.
Brother Bhim,
Dushashan will go and call them.
Dushashan, when Arjun
returns from the royal court
and when brothers Yudhishthir,
Nakul and Sahadev
are done with the yoga
bring them to Praman Koti
with you.
Shall we go, brother Bhim?
If you are fearful
of going alone with me...
Even then, no matter.
We shall leave after some time.
Fear?
Of what?
Let us go.
Let us go.
This way.
Attention!
The great son of Ganga, Bhishma
is making his entrance!
The eminent son
of the great sage Bharadwaj!*
*The author of Ayurveda.
The great Bhishma.
Greetings.
Greetings, Dronacharya.*
*Acharya: Brahmin head guide or a highly learned man.
What crime
has Hastinapur committed
that without even receiving
a proper and apt welcome
you are leaving the palace?
If a proper and apt welcome
gave solace to the heart
then I would have resided in
the woods practicing the Vedas
great Bhishma.
In order to satiate a desert,
a few clouds are not enough.
Only a few rivers
can achieve this task.
Great Drona
your heart has burnt
with the fire of this enmity
and become arid like a desert.
And I know this.
Maybe this is the reason
why the news of your arrival
was not conveyed to me
by Kripacharya.
A true Brahmin is one
whose heart never dries up
and who does not let enmity
become the mantra of his life.
The courage and ability to argue
with one's wife's brother
is not something Lord Parashuram
blessed me with.
That is why I accept
what Kripacharya said.
I may not be a true Brahmin
but am certainly
a great warrior.
I'm a knower of
scriptures and weaponry
and a great teacher too.
And Hastinapur was awaiting
such a teacher.
This way, Drona.
Greetings.
May you live long.
Take this and feed it
to the son of Pandu.
With this approach
the five thorns
in the path of Duryodhan
will be gotten rid of
one by one.
When it comes
to gaining something
deception is more potent
than strength, Kark.
When it comes
to the struggles of life
and when man does not
deem himself adequate
and loses faith
in his own strength
then he renounces virtues
and embraces vices.
In reality, villainy is
born in man's life only
when his psyche
loses self-confidence.
Only self-confidence
can bear righteousness.
What is self-confidence?
When man considers
that the struggles of life
make him weak
then he loses faith in himself.
Instead of braving the struggle
he looks for ways
to free himself of it.
But when he believes that
struggles will make him stronger
in a way a body
is strengthened with exercise
then with each struggle,
his enthusiasm magnifies.
In other words,
self-confidence is nothing but
a state of mind.
It is merely a way
of looking at life.
And the way of looking at life
is in the hands of man.
Give it a thought.
This is Praman Koti,
brother Bhim.
Many snakes and serpents
reside in this river.
They are extremely venomous.
But they bear no enmity
with the people of Kuru.
Are you listening,
brother Bhim?
Indeed. Did you not
say something about a feast?
I did.
- Yes.
Let us proceed.
Please come this way.
Do come, brother Bhim.
This way.
Look at all this.
Such varied dishes.
Our chefs
have prepared all this.
Especially for you.
When the rest of the brothers
are here, we shall begin eating.
That is alright but
brothers Yudhishthir, Arjun
Nakul, Sahadev and the rest
are not here yet.
Dushashan must be
on his way here with them.
And it would be inappropriate
to begin without them.
No, no.
We shall wait.
Brother Bhim, how about
we taste a little of everything?
That way we will know if we
need to alter the taste or not.
Indeed.
That is a good suggestion.
But we must not eat a lot.
- No, no!
We shall only taste these.
And you have a special interest
in food.
Indeed.
I am a great cook myself.
Then, brother, only you
should taste the dishes.
I too shall taste but I shall
not be able to comprehend much.
No, no.
Pay respect to food, Duryodhan.
First, you must get a whiff.
Then you must take in the aroma.
Wow!
Let herbs, saffron, fruits
and flower's aromas
satiate your heart.
This is food and not a battle.
One must not attack it.
Take a look.
Do taste this 'kheer,'*
brother Bhim.
*Rice pudding.
Our chefs make
the tastiest of 'kheer'.
No, no.
Then what will the rest
of the brothers eat?
If you insist so much
then I shall taste it a bit.
Pardon me, 'laddoos'.
I shall eat you after a while.
Duryodhan.
You are younger to me.
You should taste it first.
Me?
No, brother Bhim.
You are elder to me.
You should taste it first.
Have some.
No, I cannot eat this.
Why not?
What is wrong with this 'kheer'?
Nothing.
I was just ribbing you.
Give that to me.
It is delicious.
But brother Arjun
if you leave the city
then there will be
no Rajsuya 'Yajna.
Sahadev
if the cows are
not brought back safely
then there will be
no reverence of the city.
We need those one lakh cows
for the reverence of the city.
But brother, think
about the future as well.
How will you live by yourself
for so many years?
And in the meantime,
without your protection
what will become
of Indraprastha, brother?
Duties build the future,
Sahadev
and not the other way around.
And how can you be worried about
the future of Indraprastha?
You can see the future,
can you not?
No one can ever see
the future clearly, brother.
But I have a bad feeling
that Indraprastha is
far from attaining peace.
Something disastrous
is going to happen here.
And at a time like this
if the city is
not protected by you then...
Please let me go get the cows!
Sahadev!
Takshak is an
illusory being, Sahadev.
You do not even have the weapons
bestowed by the Gods.
You will not be able
to defeat Takshak.
I have to do this.
We need to conduct the
reverence of the city soon.
We must ensure that brother
Yudhishthir becomes King soon!
But think about his situation
as well, brother.
When he finds out
that you have made such a
big sacrifice to make him King
what will his state
of mind be, brother?
Had we been five
this would have been
my sacrifice for him.
But we are one,
Sahadev.
I am making
this sacrifice for myself.
Let me go, Sahadev.
- No, brother.
I can go to Panchali's chamber
and get the Gandiva for you.
I shall perform this penance.
Wise men say that when
one is altruistic with food
and selfish with penance
only then does
one's body and soul
stay healthy.
Let me be selfish today.
What could have happened
that My Lord had to
break his oath?
What happened,
Sahadev?
Brother Yudhishthir
Takshak stole the cows
coming here from Hastinapur.
Brother Arjun
has gone after him.
Nakul, the venom needs to be
drawn out of the soldiers.
Go and wake the serpents up.
Brother Bheem,
brother Arjun has said that you
must make arrangements
to protect the city.
Let's go, Nakul.
Bheem, I shall come with you.
The serpents
shown in this scene
were generated
using computer graphics.
No serpent can ever escape
the circle of fire, Takshak.
If you are willing
to take my refuge
then I shall
extinguish the fire.
Take your refuge!
The refuge of a human?
No.
Shoot me with your arrow,
son of Pandu.
Kill me.
I cannot do that.
I have taken the oath
of not killing serpents.
But until you give into fatigue
and accept your defeat
I shall fight you.
I accept my defeat at the moment
son of Pandu.
Take your cows with you.
But our enmity
has not ended yet.
Today, if
you do not kill me
then do remember
that I
shall certainly be back
to have my revenge.
Certainly.
I shall be waiting.
We had taken an oath,
brother Yudhishthir.
I had entered
Panchali's chamber
without her permission.
I must resort to asceticism now
and perform an austere penance.
Arjun
I am the eldest son
of King Pandu.
Yet, history shall deem you
the hero amongst the Pandavas.
Give me your blessings,
brother Yudhishthir
to have appreciation
in my penance.
May your penance
experience
knowledge and competence
always meet with
appreciation, Arjun.
Bless you!
If you do go southward
then you must certainly go to Saurasen's kingdom.*
*Surasena, present-day Braj region in Uttar Pradesh.
I have heard that the food there
is the tastiest in the
entire Aryan region!
Brother Bheem
I am going to perform a penance.
I will consume bland food
and lead a controlled life.
Do not say that, brother.
I will start crying.
How can food
hamper one's penance?
We shall meet very soon, friend.
Where will you go
to perform the penance?
Manipur* in the East
*A state in northeastern India, with the city of Imphal as its capital.
and even Pragjyotishpur* are quite famous places.
*Pragjyotishpura, now Guwahati.
I wish to see those regions.
You may certainly go there.
But after you are
done travelling
you must come
to the city near Dwaraka
to perform your penance in the Somnath Temple.*
*Located in the Prabhas Kshetra, western coast of Gujarat, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines of the god Shiva.
Chandra* had been blessed with a new life there.
*The Lunar deity Soma (lit. "juice"), the juice of sap in the plants and thus makes the Moon the lord of plants and vegetation.
Possibly
you might just
find something there.
And that may complete
your penance.
As you say, Madhav.
Pardon me, Panchali.
Before taking
such a major decision
I could not seek
your permission.
You have taken the correct
decision, My Lord.
Your experience
will benefit our kingdom.
And I...
And I shall benefit from
the lesson of patience.
May there be appreciation
in your penance, My Lord.
Handmaidens.
This life, this world
are all games
of time and tide.
What is bound to happen,
happens
and by its rules
we must abide.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Joy and sorrow
are parts of life.
Only that happens
what is destined.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Duties are more
important than life.
Actions are more important
than the amenities of life.
It is impossible to know
what fate has decided.
Once again, life
in the woods lies ahead.
The blissful life of a palace
must once again be sacrificed.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
If I am a dedicated
and faithful wife
then no stone
or pebble in your path
will ever hurt you.
Sacrifice and truth
run through the veins of this dynasty.
With all due respect, Your Highness
in order to avenge the insult
my husband and children are ready to take weapon in the war.
I have the right to ask this question.
So that everybody is going to fight for you
without selfish motives in mind.
Wait.
I'll greet them first, My Lord.
Before you come in, give me an answer,
who you really are?
Panchali,
he is the sister-in-law Subhadra's son
Abhimanyu.
I know his name, My Lord.
I even know what is his relation to us.
But I want to know who is he truly is?
Sister-in-law!
Son Abhimanyu.
Panchali do not ask what all people know.
There are various types of clouds.
Some drift without producing rain.
Some carry flood.
Some bring beautiful bath.
While some just rumble.
Who you really are Abhimanyu?
Tell that to mother.
I...
I am my father arrows.
I need a blood bath.
But the glory will go to my father.
I shield my brothers.
I will stand in front of them at the moment of struggle.
And behind them in peace time.
But above all,
above all, I am kohl* for the eyes of Mother Panchali,
*Ancient eye cosmetic, traditionally made by grinding galena (lead sulfide) and other ingredients.
Each time there are tears in those eyes,
I could wipe the entire existense.
These are my tears,
Queen Mother, do you want me to die before...
Why you, Subhadra.
Why you
gave birth to such a child?
Gems may be born out of sister-in-law's story
but it is intended to be ornament of the Empress.
He is your son.
He is surely mine.
And until the end of time
the child's name will be immortalized!
New era
always begins with the destruction, Majesty.
The alignment of heavenly bodies
indicates the major changes.
Every war causes great destruction.
Tell me what will be destroyed.
What will happen to my children?
Majesty, try to remember the story of Matsya* avatar.
*Matsya ("Fish") is the first avatar of Vishnu that rescued the first man, Manu.
When the Almighty has submerged the entire
world in water.
Who have seeked refuge
to the Almighty?
As a result, only he is still alive.
Similarly, even in this war
people who are destined to
be destroyed
are those who has not been in the path 
of refuge in the Almighty.
If your children,
have left the Almighty,
and embraced luxury.
Then they are bound to be destroyed, Majesty.
But there is no deficit of competence on my side,
Great Sage.
His Majesty Bisma, great teacher Dorna,
and because maharathi Karna is a great warrior
who will keep my sons safe on the battlefield.
Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn
Rahu, Ketu,* Sun and Moon
*Rahu is a severed head of an asura, that swallows the sun causing eclipses. Ketu is said to be the body of Rahu, after the head of the asura was cut off by Vishnu.
are much stronger
than any warriors from each side, Majesty.
When it's time for someone to die
no man can keep it from him.
However, you may
strengthen your heart.
Survive the blow, Majesty.
That's all.
What do you mean?
Are all my children
will die in the war?
The entire Kuru dynasty will disappear,
only those people will live,
which has the protection of the Almighty.
Which have the protection of the Most Powerful?
Answer me, O' Great Sage.
Do my children
do not have the protection of the Most Powerful?
It has been so
to my fear and worry
but do not let it weighed you down, Majesty.
My children...
will die...
No...
Why did Great Sage Vyas has given life to my children?
There must be a way
to keep my children alive, O' Great Sage!
You have
the power to save a son.
You can save any of your sons' life, Majesty.
One son!
God has blessed me with a hundred sons.
A hundred children.
They were supposed to build my husband's empire.
And you say
that
I could only keep one of them living.
Your Excellency, it is also not an easy task
however
there are ways
using one of which, an heir to a Kuru dynasty
can stay alive.
Who can stay alive?
Who can I give a ride to?
How do I...
This is your decision to choose.
Do you want him to stay alive, Majesty?
You have to think of ways
to keep the child alive.
I can not even say
if this arrangement will benefit your children,
or Kunti's side.
All I can say is
that only one lamp of the Kuru dynasty 
that will continues to burn.
Remember
the burning of lights at the foot of the Almighty
is one of the beneficial.
Kuru dynasty would disappear
only those people will live
who have protection from the Almighty.
I can not even say
if this arrangement
will benefit your children
or Kunti's side.
The burning of lights at the foot of the Almighty
is one of the beneficial.
Queen Sudeshna
even in all regions of the Aryan
you do not find a decent young man
for such a beautiful girl?
We will arrange a Swayamvar
for this year Vasudev.
But you have declared war.
Who knows how many princes
who will live until the end of the war.
So how do we
have Uttara married before the war?
Being recorded for the alignment of the object 
of the heavenly bodies.
We still have some time before
war begins.
We still have four months with us,
Queen Sudeshna.
But how can that be Swayamvar
held in just four months?
What needs to arrange a Swayamvar?
Here, there Uttara herself
and even the groom.
There you go.
It is a Swayamvar.
King Virat,
if you think it's alright,
shouldn't we marry Uttara and Abhimanyu
at the earliest possible?
In Abhimanyu
running blood from both the Kurus and Yadavas.
And Uttara
is the great Matsya dynasty descendant.
Their marriage
will merge
the three major dynasties, King Virat.
Impossible!
Your Majesty, how can you
make such a major decision without
discussing it first with me?
Sudeshna, this is Uttara's good fortune
that she will become daughter-in-law of Pandu's sons.
She will be Krishna student's wife.
Abhimanyu is a great warrior.
Kshatriya's daughters are married in a Swayamvar, Majesty.
Don't let the war ruin everything.
What if Pandu's sons defeated in this war?
How about the future of our Uttara?
Queen Sudeshna
do you have a firm conviction
that you can shape the future of Uttara
in accordance to your plan?
Do you
have a certain right to time?
I'm sorry, Vasudev.
But even you
do not have right to time.
Of course
I have
no right to time.
However, I have faith
in the generosity of time.
I promise you, Queen Sudeshna
that Uttara would give birth 
to the greatest empire of the entire nation.
Abhimanyu
will become the one to usher in a new era.
While his son
will begin the first phase in the transformation.
Your daughter Uttara
would take away the whole Aryan region out of war
to peace and tranquility.
If your daughter was born
to become a queen
then she might just
turn a 'Brahmin
into a King.
Kings and spectators
present here
not all dreams are realised
in this world.
But a resolution never fails.
If a person makes a resolution
then in some form
or through a medium
it certainly gets realized.
To have my daughter
married to the
most competent warrior
of the world
is my resolution
and it shall
indeed be fulfilled!
I address the 'Brahmins
present here
and if there is a competent
person amongst them
then he must come forth.
Did you see...
Did you see that, Pateshwar?
I came here and the King
opened this competition
to the 'Brahmins.
This is certainly a sign.
Be quiet, Batukeshwar.
Just because Lord Parashuram
is a 'Brahmin
it does not mean that
all 'Brahmins' are like him.
How can 'Brahmins' win
such a difficult competition?
We will be insulted.
Pateshwar, there is
no insult in trying.
You five brothers seem mighty.
One of you should go there
and give it a try.
Brother Yudhishthir
it is not right for us
to stay here.
The gaze of all the spectators
is upon the 'Brahmins.
If brother Duryodhan
recognizes us then...
We should go from here,
brother Yudhishthir.
You are correct, Arjun.
Let's go.
What is this foolishness
being exhibited
by King Drupad?
When we mighty 'Kshatriyas
could not achieve this task
then how can these 'Brahmins
achieve the same?
Where are you going,
young 'Brahmins?
Despite having the capability
to win the competition
leaving the gathering must also
be termed competence!
But such competence
is of no use to anyone.
Turning one's back to actions
must also be termed excellence.
But does such excellence
help the world gain
anything, 'Brahmins?
To think only of one's joy,
sorrow and oath
and not of one's duty
towards the world
is utter selfishness.
But a truly competent person
can never be selfish.
Even when a lion is done
devouring its prey
it leaves a good amount of it
for other carnivores.
Is such altruistic behaviour
not the basis of
righteousness, 'Brahmins?
Think about it.
If you have true competence
then come forth.
The welfare of the world is
connected to this competition
and possibly
your welfare may also
be connected to it.
Your friend Vasudev
not only invoked but also
assured you, Arjun.
You cannot back out now.
If Krishna has said it
then it must be correct.
Go on, Arjun.
May you be victorious.
Even seekers of alms
have been filled with the zeal
to display their might.
When such people only know
how to hold a bowl for alms
then how can they lift a bow?
Go back, 'Brahmin.
If you try to lift the bow
then you will lose even
the last drop of your dignity.
Think of Lord Parashuram
and move forth!
The gurus who teach people
the art of weaponry
are 'Brahmins.
Then you need not be scared,
young man. Move forth.
Our blessings are with you.
May you be victorious.
You are indeed Prince Arjun.
Lord Shiva has given me the sign
that this competition
is solely for you, Prince.
You will indeed be successful.
King Drupad, do accept
my greetings.
Vasudev Krishna
do accept my greetings.
Princess Shikhandini
and Princes Draupadi
I bow before you.
Look! He is bowing before
Princess Draupadi!
Every woman
is a form of Goddess Durga.
One who does not respect women
has no competence.
If you accidentally get married
to the Princess, 'Brahmin
then what will you do?
Will you accept the Princess
as your wife
or establish her in a temple?
Every home is a temple,
Crown Prince Rukmi.
And the wife...
The wife is the deity
of the temple.
I assure you
that I bow before
your sister Rukmini
every single day.
Move forth, young 'Brahmin.
Let's see if the values
imparted to you
have given you the
adequate strength or not.
All hail the great 'Brahmin!
All hail the great 'Brahmin!
All hail the great 'Brahmin!
All hail the great 'Brahmin!
All hail the great 'Brahmin!
All hail the great 'Brahmin!
King Drupad
I, Patukeshwar Sharma,
hail from Panchapuri
and I brought them
to the'swayamvar.
Now, you must reward me
handsomely, King Drupad.
They are my friends.
My friends.
A 'Brahmin' won!
He won!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
Princess, place the garland
around his neck this instant
otherwise I shall have my
granddaughter married to him.
Arjun.
Engage in a grappling combat
with me, Krishna!
If I die in this combat
my guard will slay your parents.
If you die
your parents will be spared.
Now, tell me,
Krishna.
Do you still wish
to engage in a combat
or in order to save your parents
you are prepared
to embrace death.
I took an oath to save millions
of parents of the Aryan region.
That is why, I am here,
uncle Kansa.
How many parents will you
be able to kill?
Engage in a combat with me, uncle!
All hail Shri Krishna!
All hail Shri Krishna!
All hail Shri Krishna!
All hail Shri Krishna!
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!
Uncle, did the possibility
of death of your parents
not rob you of your strength?
How could you gather
courage at that moment?
How were you able
to keep your mind calm?
Dear
where there is affection
there is always the possibility
of being agitated.
Being the reason of death
of the people who gave you life
is as agonizing
as being the reason
of death of your children.
But there is a truth
that man seldom remembers...
That every particle
of the creation
is a part of the Almighty.
That is why, they always
remain connected.
The way a flower
spreads fragrance
in the entire chamber
and an odoriferous object
spreads a foul smell in it
similarly
the joys and sorrows of man
influence the entire world.
One's joy
makes
everyone experience
a little joy.
One's sorrow makes
everyone experience
a little sorrow.
In other words, joy and sorrow
are alike in the world?
That is correct,
dear
Such is the creation
of the Almighty.
And when
unrighteousness escalates
this balance gets disrupted.
Because of Kansa,
the entire Yadava society
was filled with sorrow.
Because of Jarasandha,
the entire Aryan region
had to witness the destruction
of righteousness.
And now
because of Duryodhan
the entire Kuru kingdom
is unhappy.
The subjects are being
exploited and tortured.
When unhappiness
escalates in the world
very few people experience joy
while the majority
experience sorrow.
As a result, the society
falls prey to illness.
At a time like this,
treating that illness
becomes mandatory.
Sacrificing oneself
in order to put an end
to the unrighteous
becomes mandatory.
At a time like this,
relationships
and love hold no meaning.
Neither does selfishness
hold any value
nor does one hope for joy.
This is the situation
that lies ahead of you now.
The entire family of King Pandu
must either make a sacrifice
or accept the unrighteousness of
the sons of King Dhritarashtra.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
The decision
rests with all of you.
A tree does not know
the taste of its fruit.
Similarly
none of you will derive
the benefit of this sacrifice.
Look within your hearts.
Do you have
the required compassion?
Does your soul have
the required righteousness
to take the decision
to sacrifice yourself
for the welfare of the society?
All of you need to
meditate over this.
Give me your blessings,
uncle
to aid me pacify the burning
hearts of the sons of Pandu
so that they can pardon
Duryodhan and his brothers.
May the daughter of Drupad,
daughter-in-law Draupadi
give up the thought
of waging a war.
People who lead a righteous life
have the capacity within them
to pardon others, Vidur.
But I
have a suspicion on Shakuni.
What could have made him propose
the idea of avoiding a war?
How could he...
How could he make
Duryodhan and Dusshasan
accept this proposal?
He must certainly have
a plan behind all this.
It will certainly
get foiled, uncle.
Each plan of the King of Gandhar
will get foiled.
Uncle,
the sons of Pandu
have Vasudev with them.
The competence to foil
even the most treacherous plan
lies with Vasudev Krishna,
uncle.
Allow me to leave.
Goodbye.
May your journey be fruitful.
Let's proceed,
charioteer.
Minister Vidur
is proceeding towards the city of Virat.
Splendid.
Marvellous,
my darling.
Before the war
the obstacle lying in
your path needs to be
taken care of by me.
His Excellency Bhishma
Great Guru Drona
Maharathi Jayadrath
and Great Archer Karna are
the great warriors on our side.
We must provide them
with the opportunity
to demonstrate their greatness.
That is why
I must look for a way
to tackle that treacherous
Vasudev Krishna
and that too,
quite soon.
What is the plan,
uncle?
My darling
as the envoy of peace
on behalf of the Pandavas
Krishna will certainly come here
because we have sent Sanjay
with the message
that
it is mandatory
for Vasudev Krishna
to be here.
My darling
you need to make
a strong and illusory rope
which cannot be
broken even by Airavat,*
*Airavata, a white elephant.
Lord Indra's mount.
The court of Hastinapur
shall witness
Just watch
how Vasudev Krishna
gets captured by us.
This tie
shall go beyond
the physical realm
and become a tie
between your souls.
Bless you,
son!
My blessing to you is
that may your wife
become your motivation
and not your limit.
And may your husband...
May your husband
become your pride
and not your tie.
Bless you!
Bless you!
Bless you!
May you live long!
Struggling for righteousness
is not a duty
but a decision
and a vow.
Similarly, for you,
this war
is not a duty.
It is a vow
taken for the society.
Give me your blessings,
Mother Draupadi.
May I be able to serve you
for the rest of my life.
Apart from the five
husbands of yours
the entire lineage
of King Shantanu
will be destroyed.
The entire dynasty will be
annihilated in this war.
Look within your hearts.
Do you have
the required compassion
to take the decision
to sacrifice yourself
for the welfare of the society?
My blessings...
I bless you to...
Bless him to have
a long life, dear.
The blessing to a long life
is the right of a person
during times of peace
but during war-time
it is merely a hope.
Whatever Arjun has got
must be shared equally
among you five brothers.
What happened, son?
What did you say, mother?
I got the daughter of Drupad,
the King of Panchal, as charity.
I got a wife, mother.
Your daughter-in-law.
And
unknowingly, you
ordered us five brothers
to divide her amongst ourselves.
How can
a woman be divided
into five parts, mother?
How?
Draupadi.
Draupadi!
Stop, dear!
But Arjun, why...
Why did you
use the term 'charity
for a woman?
It is charity, mother.
Giving away one's daughter...
You have taught us
that all forms of charity
in the world
tie down the fortune
of the one engaging in it.
Only giving away one's daughter
opens up one's fortune.
That is why, Nakul had said
that his brother Arjun's
fortune had opened up.
Mother, you could have
at least turned around once.
The ones who have
the right to give orders
do not have the right
to be ignorant.
Mother, have a look
at what I have got as charity.
Whatever Arjun has got
must be shared equally
among you five brothers.
I got the daughter of Drupad,
King of Panchal, as charity.
How can
a woman be divided
into five parts, mother?
Draupadi...
Dear
pardon me.
It was my mistake.
But
my sons never planned
to go to your 'swayamvar.
Never had I imagined
that Arjun...
That Arjun would win
the competition.
Were you that certain
of your plans, Lady Kunti?
Are your sons that competent
that they can circumvent
both fate and destiny
and realize all your plans?
You are correct, Draupadi.
It is my fault.
You have every right
to be angry with me.
I am your offender.
No, lady-
Pardon me.
Blaming you is incorrect.
If the floodwaters of a river
drown a deer
then the river is not at fault.
But even the deer
is not at fault, lady.
What is my fault
in this situation?
You are not at fault.
You are not at fault, dear.
I can understand
your state of mind.
The mere thought
of being divided among men makes
a woman experience hell itself.
But
that will not happen.
The ones who have
the right to give orders
also have the right
to abrogate them.
I...
I will tell my sons
not to follow my orders.
This life, this world
are games of time and tide.
What is bound to happen,
happens
and by its rules
we must abide.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Joy and sorrow
are parts of life
Only that happens
what is destined.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Time is the strongest
in the world.
Arjun.
Marry Draupadi
this instant, son.
Marry Draupadi
this instant, son.
And right after that
you must go to Kampilya.
Forget the order
I gave you by deeming it
a bad dream, son.
No, mother.
That is not possible now.
Arjun
listen to mother.
When a volcano erupts
birds do not stay on
the trees of the mountain.
They fly away instantly.
If a place involves
a moral dilemma
one must not
stay there for long.
You should go.
After a while
we shall drop mother off
near the kingdom of Panchal.
Drop me off?
What do you mean?
Mother, you may be present
in Arjun's marriage
but we four brothers cannot.
We will never show ourselves
to Princess Draupadi again.
What are you saying, son?
Why will you not be able
to show yourselves?
When I have abrogated my order
then what problem
do you have with it?
Mother, an order
can be abrogated
but not the words
uttered by one.
Words are like seeds
and when they
sink into the heart
they emerge in some form
or the other in the future.
That is why, mother,
wise men say
that the one who utters words
without thinking first
commits a sin.
But son
it was...
It was a mistake.
Shravan being shot
was also a mistake, mother.
But for that
King Dashrath had to
pay very dearly.
It is not that things
done unintentionally
have no consequences, mother.
Unknowingly, you have bound
Princess Draupadi by
your words mother.
You have bound her by your words
and she is obligated
to fulfill them.
Unknowingly, you have
named the relationship between
Princess Draupadi and us.
And the moral dilemma
is that, mother
it cannot be rendered false.
Then what is the solution to it?
Answer me.
Answer me.
Someone please answer me!
What is the solution to it?
Yudhishthir
tell me.
Answer me.
Someone please answer me!
No maiden can be divided
among five men, mother.
The solution to a moral dilemma
always lies in meditation.
All of us have decided that
we will meditate, mother.
It is Arjun's duty
to marry the Princess.
He shall marry her
and we four brothers
shall resort to asceticism.
Princess.
Prince Arjun
is there a solution
to Lady Kunti's order?
It is easy to look for gravel
amidst wheat, Princess.
But when
wheat falls amidst gravel
it is impossible to look for it.
Similarly
finding solutions
to certain situations
is very difficult.
How did this situation
become so difficult, Prince?
My father conducted
the 'swayamvar
you won the competition
based solely on your competence,
I deemed you my husband.
I did not even question you
about your identity!
I did not ask you your name!
I did not ask about your clan,
dynasty or future plans!
What did I do, Prince
that made
the situation difficult?
You are not at fault, Princess.
Maybe fate is at fault here.
Fate.
Fate can be designed.
It is not definite, Prince.
My Govind says so himself.
That very fate
has been designed by my mother
by dividing you amongst
us five brothers.
Now, even if mother wants to
she cannot go back on her words.
I have
no answers to your
other questions, Princess.
I have only one request.
Please
marry my eldest brother.
Pardon me, dear
but if the Kauravas win
then the entire society
will meet with misfortune
and establishing righteousness
will become impossible.
And
in the path to defeating
the Kauravas
you are acting as a fortress.
If you take an oath
to back out from this war
then I can release you
from the promise you made.
The decision is yours.
Either back out from this war
or give up the protection
of your armour.
Do accept the charity,
Lord Indra.
For the sake
of your son's victory
you had to engage
in such a grave deception
with me, Lord Indra.
The mere sight of this
gives me the joy of victory.
What have you done,
Lord Indra?!
You asked for the armour and
ear-rings of King Karna of Anga!
Yes, Arjun.
Now, there will be no obstacle
in the path to your victory.
But how could you act
so unjustly, father?!
By rendering my enemy weak
you have rendered me
weak as well.
If there is no challenge
then how can there be
an increase in one's strength?
The trees that grow on rocks
are very strong, Lord Indra.
But the stem of a lotus
growing in a pond
is not strong.
Today, you have tainted
my reputation, Lord Indra.
The severed thumb of Ekalavya
weighs my spirit down
even to this day.
Even today, whenever someone
appreciates my archery
I am reminded of Ekalavya.
I begin to doubt
that had Ekalavya
not sacrificed his thumb
would he have been
stronger than me?
Because of
Ekalavya's severed thumb
my competence has been
gravely tainted, father.
By asking for the armour and
ear-rings of King Karna of Anga
you have tainted
my reputation further, father.
Because of me
you inflicted such agony
on the King of Anga.
Did
you not have faith
in the competence of your son?
Did you not have faith
in his Gandiva?
Or did you not have faith
in your own blessing, father?
The question is not about
your competence, Arjun.
Karna's armour
was not a celestial weapon
bestowed by a God.
It was a part
of Surya Dev himself.
After his birth
Karna was Messed with it.
It was necessary
to have it removed.
In a war of humans
no part of a God
can ever take part in it.
Neither for protection
nor attack.
That is why, Lord Hanuman
shall be present on your flag
and not in your chariot.
But you have cursed me,
father!
I could have slain
King Karna of Anga
with the presence of his
armour and ear-rings.
However,
as I have taken an oath
I will still slay
King Karna of Anga!
However 
by asking for the armour and
ear-rings of the King of Anga
you...
You have snatched the joy
of victory from me, father.
People will say
that only because of
the weakness of my enemy
did I gain victory.
My victory
has been turned into
an insult by you, father.
Now, please have
mercy on your son
and return the King of Anga
his armour and ear-rings!
That is impossible,
Arjun.
King Karna of Anga
will never take back anything
he gave away as charity.
However, I am willing
to give you a boon.
Go ahead,
dear Karna.
Ask me for a boon.
I have engaged in charity,
Lord Indra.
I have not engaged
in a business dealing.
If I grace someone
with my presence
and give him nothing in return
then it would taint
my reputation.
Go ahead.
Ask for anything you like,
dear
To a warrior,
the greatest boon
is his weapon.
If you are so intent on giving
then give me a weapon.
An unfailing weapon
which, when released in the
name of a particular person
slays that very person.
So be it!
Do remember, dear.
You can use this weapon
only once
and that too
when the enemy is right before
your eyes in the battlefield.
I accept it, Lord Indra.
Arjun
you will indeed die at my hands.
I will use the very weapon
given by your father
to slay you
very soon...
Karna!
Karna!
Karna!
Karna!
Karna!
Son!
Karna!
Karna!
Karna!
Karna...
Karna!
Son!
Karna!
Be careful,
King of Gandhar.
The war begins tomorrow
but you are already staggering!
Before embarking on
an enterprise of this magnitude
it is quite natural to stagger,
Vasudev.
When man becomes presumptuous
he also becomes heedless.
And when it is time
for man to stagger
the entire creation
compels him to become heedless.
Various situations arise
which are bound to make man
presumptuous.
And what are
the various situations
you are going to give rise to
Vasudev?
When did I ever give rise
to a situation?
Man's actions
give rise to various situations.
And our reactions
in those situations
bind us to them.
His Excellency
had your sister married
to a blind man
and that gave rise
to a situation where revenge
was born in your heart.
And by taking an oath
to aid your sister
and her sons have the throne
you have bound yourself
to that situation.
Tomorrow's war
is the result of that oath.
Duryodhan.
The first one is
Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Father, mother.
Greetings.
To fight me is difficult.
That is why
my name is Duryodhan.
I shall not allow my enemies
even the time to be fearful.
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Greetings, uncle.
Greetings.
May you be victorious,
my dear.
May you be victorious.
I was certain, uncle
that you shall indeed be here
to fulfill your promise.
And until I fulfill my promise,
my dear
I shall stay right here
in Hastinapur.
So, uncle.
In this victory 'yagna' of mine
who is the first
to be sacrificed?
Nakul.
Go on, my dear.
Go on.
The first to compete
with Prince Duryodhan
is Prince Nakul of the Pandavas!
All hail Prince Nakul!
Mother, brother Nakul
is on his way.
Do you know that
when he was in Hastinapur
he used to make me laugh a lot?
Among all my brothers,
he is the handsomest.
All hail Prince Nakul!
All hail Prince Nakul!
Sanjay. - All hail Prince Nakul!
- What is happening?
Your Majesty, Prince Nakul
just made a wondrous entrance.
Sanjay, what is happening
at the moment?
Your Majesty
among Prince Duryodhan
and Prince Nakul
Prince Duryodhan is exhibiting
greater talent and skill.
Wonderful, son!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
What was the outcome?
Nakul lost to Duryodhan,
sister-in-law.
Uncle.
That was not even a competition.
But it was certainly the first
step towards victory, dear.
Who is next?
Sahadev.
Next is Prince Sahadev
of the Pandavas!
All hail Prince Sahadev!
All hail Prince Sahadev!
Sahadev?
Why not Bheem?
You must first get rid of
the smaller thorns, my darling.
All hail Prince Sahadev!
All hail Prince Sahadev!
All hail Prince Sahadev!
All hail Prince Sahadev!
All hail Prince Sahadev!
Sanjay.
What is happening at the moment?
- Your Majesty
among Prince Duryodhan
and Prince Sahadev
the former is exhibiting
wondrous valour.
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Duryodhan defeated
my second son as well.
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Ashwathama has given us
a new name, Nakul.
Now, we are not the Kauravas
but the Pandavas.
Nakul, I find this name
to be quite endearing.
It seems as though
father is with us.
Why? Did you not have
any premonition today?
I have the premonition
of victory.
A premonition of victory
after defeat?
Nakul, brother Bheem had told me
that if I take part in
the competition before him
I must not tire Duryodhan out.
He does not want
Duryodhan to say
that he lost to brother Bheem
because of fatigue.
Sire, if the third competitor
also turns out to be Pandu's son
then this competition
is certainly a deception.
This is deception.
Even if the names of the sons
of Dhritarashtra are announced
they will not fight Duryodhan.
All this facade
is only to facilitate Duryodhan
to be crowned as the prince.
I know this, Vidur.
But...
But the orders of the king
have left me
with no alternative.
Now, it is Yudhishthir's turn,
my darling.
I will oust him from
the competition in no time.
But if you are unable to do so
then do remember
that people who take pride
in their beauty
are afraid of their reflection
lest they see
their own ugliness.
If you try to corrupt
Yudhishthir's interior
then success will be
an easy one.
Yudhishthir.
Yudhishthir?
- Mother Kunti.
Why are brother Dusshasan
and the rest not here?
And between whom is this
competition taking place?
Maybe between your father
and uncle Pandu.
How can that be possible?
Father has not even gone
to take part in the competition.
And is uncle going
to descend from heaven?
Be quiet, Dushala.
Watch the competition.
I have given you my word
to stay quiet, son.
Let my name and my fame
not get tarnished.
Indeed, father.
Whether Duryodhan wins
or someone else does
your glory is bound to magnify.
Next is Prince Yudhishthir
of the Pandavas!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
Your Majesty, Prince Duryodhan
and Prince Yudhishthir
are exhibiting equal valour
in the competition.
Both of them are at par
in their skills, your Majesty.
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
Try to recollect my words,
Duryodhan.
Recollect my words.
Yudhishthir, you truly
are very powerful.
The blood of which dynasty
runs through your veins?
From whom did your characterless
mother conceive you?
Pray tell me.
Did Queen Gandhari
give birth to a lump of flesh?
Yes, Madri.
A lump of flesh
has been delivered.
But why, Lord?
Why is brother-in-law and
sister-in-law's life filled with
so much of
sorrows and grievances?
Not just them
the whole of Hastinapur
and the entire Kuru clan
is a victim of this misfortune.
Even your son
Yudhisthir, Kunti.
Yudhisthir's misfortune!
My father used to say...
Only an unfortunate king
lacks a brother or a kin
for his protection.
A lone tree gets uprooted
easily during a storm.
If it is in a group,
it doesn't get uprooted.
Kunti
I've thought over
what Madri said.
Madri is absolutely right.
Now that Yudhisthir
is the future of Hastinapur
four brothers are also required
for his protection.
You have to invoke the deities
again with the help of mantras.
The Kuru clan wants
four more heirs from you.
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Let's go, Sanjay.
Why did you stop, Sanjay?
Who has obstructed my way?
- It's sire Bheeshma, King.
King, I've learnt that
you've set up an army
to attack someone.
- Yes.
I am going to
conquer everything!
East, West, North, South!
I've taken an oath
to extend my kingdom all over!
I can't give you
permission for this.
I don't need
anybody's permission!
I've had enough of obeying
orders and commands!
I kept following
these obligations so far!
But to no avail.
Now, I'll take my own decisions.
Disperse!
Do take your own decisions.
But the river which flows
with violent speed and current...
The water of such a river
is not fit for drinking.
When someone is enraged
he loses control
over his mind.
Take a decision
when you calm down.
I don't want to calm down!
What did I gain by taking
decisions while staying calm?
Except humiliation, disgrace
and indignity!
The Queen Mother got me married
to the Princess of Gandhar.
It was a wise decision,
wasn't it?
But what did I gain?
What?
Gandhari insulted me
by blindfolding herself!
But still, I accepted her
at your behest.
What did I gain from that,
sire?
What did I gain?
What and when has
Dhritarashtra ever gained?
But, Your Majesty...
Brother, what will you gain by
following the path of warfare?
I will...
I definitely will...
When the fever
is too high
villagers burn their hands.
That pain...
That pain fetches the heat out
of their bodies.
Vidur, I am also in search
of one such pain.
I want to feel the pain of
wounds caused by swords.
So that, I don't get to hear
the lament of my heart.
I don't want to hear that.
I don't want to hear that...
I don't have any son.
My wife has delivered
a lump of flesh.
What sort of irony
is this?
Because of being blind
I have always been at
the mercy of people.
Now, am I supposed to face
their tongue-lashing as well?
What will they think of me?
What sort of a man am I
who is incapable of giving
a child to his wife?
I couldn't
give her a child.
Don't insult Mahadev
by using such words.
To expect a child from Gandhari
was our mistake.
It was my mistake.
I should have understood earlier
that it's not possible
for a woman to give birth
to a 100 children
in a single lifetime.
God's blessing never
goes in vain.
Actually, she has not given
birth to a lump of flesh.
She has delivered the source
of a 100 babies.
Your 100 children have taken
birth in the form of seeds.
Now, the person
who can bring them
to life is my son...
Sage Vedvyas.
Shakuni, what is the sage doing?
He has prepared
an underground cave
and named it 'Kshiti Garbha'.*
*"Earth Womb"
Vedvyas has said that
inside this cave
Gandhari's sons will get formed.
If he can really
perform miracles
then why doesn't he
cast some spell
and give life to my children?
Vedvyas doesn't
perform miracles
his knowledge does.
He is the son-in-law
of Sage Jabal*
Vedvyas' father-in-law.
an expert on the Atharva Veda.
Have faith in him.
He will keep his word.
Vedvyas has summoned
Queen Gandhari and all of you
to the 'Kshiti Garbha'.
Greetings, mother.
The 100 embryos
that Gandhari has blessed
the royal family with...
I have embedded them
in these 100 urns. Mother
they are all
floating in clarified butter
that has been specially treated.
And they are being
nurtured with
many unique miraculous
herbs.
When the right time comes,
in these urns
Gandhari's 100 children
will take birth.
And, Gandhari
when Lord Shiv blessed you
and gave you this boon
you must have had a desire
for a daughter too.
The Lord has also answered
this unspoken desire of yours.
A daughter will be born
from the 101st urn.
The first feature of a king
is his strength.
Yudhisthir will be known for
his good and just deeds.
And I know that.
But a king's deeds and
justness receive respect
only when he has the strength
to protect that justice.
I want a son, Kunti
who has the strength of
a 1000 elephants in his arms.
He should be like the wind,
when it comes to strength.
Just like when the Lord of Wind
gets angry
he destructs the forests,
brings about cyclones
he destructs mountains and
converts them to dust.
The same strength should be
possessed by my son, Kunti.
Chant the mantra and
invite the Lord of Wind, Kunti.
Tell me, Shakuni.
What does the sight
look like?
Is there...
Is there any flutter
in any of the urns?
Is there...
Is there any sign of
life visible?
This cave
is filled with the lives of my
nephews, Your Highness.
There's a flutter in
each of these urns.
Just like the one in your
brother Pandu's heart.
The same kind of
flutter.
Pandu!
Fluttering, in Pandu's heart?
Of course! Don't you
feel it, Your Highness?
Not just flutter but a quake.
There's a quake in his
heart, Your Highness.
His son, in spite of being
the oldest in the royal family
is helpless in front
of these 100 sons.
Just watch.
My 100 sons will be
his strength, Shakuni.
Strength!
Strength!
Strength!
Your 100 sons
will be the strength of Pandu's
son, Your Highness?
Then you will do
the right thing.
My dear sister
has deceived you,
Your Highness.
Instead of giving you
a 100 princes
she has given you a 100 ordinary
soldiers, Your Highness.
Who will be Pandu's son's
bodyguards.
One of them will carry
his sword for him.
One will hold his
fan for him.
And one of them will also
have to pick up his slippers,
Your Highness.
My dear sister is very evil,
Your Highness.
Or else, you are
deceiving my dear sister,
Your Highness.
She went through so much pain
and gave you a 100 princes.
And you...
You wish
to bring them up
as a 100 ordinary soldiers?
Who has cheated whom?
I'm unable to understand it,
Your Highness.
This is a very complex question.
But
when the time comes
you only will have to
answer it.
At your invitation
I have appeared, Kunti.
I am here to fulfil the boon
of Sage Durvasa.
Then bless me with a son as
powerful as you, Lord.
Half the body of
your son
is made of adamantine, Kunti.
I will myself reside
in his arms.
His enemies will shiver on
hearing of his achievements.
He will be very powerful.
The whole world will know him
by the name of Vrikodar Bheem.*
*Vrikodar: 'one with a wolf's belly'. 
Bheem: 'terrible', 'awful'.
My Bheem.
I will go and get
milk for him.
Bheem!
Bheem!
Bheem...
My son.
The architecture of the Gods,
Vishwakarma, himself
is helping the sons of Pandu
by building the city of
Indraprastha for them, brother.
In other words
to aid them in the
reverence of the city
it is time now to send them
one lakh cows.
Why do I hear a tone of doubt
in your voice, Minister?
Do you think I do not remember
my promises, Vidur?!
I do not doubt you,
brother Dhritarashtra.
It is easy to give charity
to the impoverished
but when being charitable
to the affluent
envy is born in the process.
I am alluding
to Prince Duryodhan,
Your Highness.
Minister!
The Crown Prince
is a gallant warrior
oh righteous one
Minister Vidur.
The Crown Prince will not break
his promise, Your Excellency.
But
why give away
one lakh cows, Minister?
Why do we not send
all the cows of Hastinapur
to Indraprastha?
Why do we not send them
all the gold coins
with your permission?
Why are you are being sarcastic,
King of Gandhar?
I am not being sarcastic,
oh intelligent one.
I am not being sarcastic.
The true property of a kingdom
is not represented by
either cows or gold coins.
The true property of a kingdom
is its subjects.
Beloved Duryodhan knows that.
But the thing is...
Out of his property,
my nephew
will give away
one lakh gold coins
and even one lakh cows.
If he exhausts his fortune
by helping the Pandavas
in becoming prosperous
then
how will he
gain all this wealth again?
Even today,
the subjects of Hastinapur
go to great pains
to make the kingdom prosperous,
King of Gandhar.
And they will continue to do so.
In other words
the subjects of Hastinapur
who wish to migrate
to the city of the Pandavas
should not be
permitted to do so?
This is
all I wanted to know, Vidur.
What do you mean?
Your Highness
a new city is being built there.
Many people
are leaving Hastinapur
and migrating to Indraprastha.
I fear, Your Highness
that if majority of the subjects
migrate to Indraprastha
then Hastinapur will never be
able to become prosperous again.
If that happens
then what will the Minister do?
A mahout* uses love to control an elephant, King of Gandhar.
*A mahout/mahamatra  is a person who rides an elephant.
And that is why
the elephant never
forsakes the mahout.
Duryodhan must also
employ love
to control the subjects.
Certainly,
Your Excellency.
Certainly.
But before one learns
to control it with love
the elephant
is captured quite cruelly.
You seem to be forgetting this,
Your Excellency.
The subjects of Hastinapur
cannot be allowed
to leave the city.
This is what I feel,
Your Highness.
You are correct,
Shakuni.
Minister!
- Your Highness.
You need to make
an announcement.
No subject of Hastinapur
can leave the city
and migrate to Indraprastha.
Any person who
disobeys this order
shall be imprisoned
and punished.
But dear...
Uncle
this order shall be executed
personally by you,
I hope you have
no problem, uncle.
It is my duty,
Your Highness.
Your Highness, why use
a sword to kill an ant?
His Excellency Bhishma
need not be bothered for this.
If you allow me
then in order to stop
the subjects from leaving
I can send King Karna of Anga.
Then ask the King of Anga
to close the gates
of the city of Hastinapur.
And to allow no subject
of Hastinapur
to leave the city.
As you say,
Your Highness.
Your Excellency.
Close the gates of the city!
The gates are closing!
- Make haste!
We must leave post-haste!
- Open the gates!
The gates are closing!
- Make haste. - Open the gates!
Make haste!
Let's go.
- They are closing the gates!
The gates are closing!
- Let's go! - Open the gates!
Open the gates! - Make haste!
- King of Anga
order the soldiers
to arrest all the subjects.
Open the gates!
- My entire family...
My Lord, where are you?
My Lord...
My Lord,
I am still on this side.
My Lord...
The subjects are leaving
the city, King of Anga.
Have the gates of the city
closed, King of Anga!
You need to be stern with them!
What are you thinking?!
Father...
Father!
Father!
My son is still inside!
King of Anga... - Be quiet,
Prince Dusshasan!
While closing the gates
of the city
one cannot close
the gates of one's heart.
I have accepted this duty
and I shall decide
how to carry it out.
Let's go.
Father...
Father!
Father!
Father...
Open the gates!
Open the gates!
- Open them!
Calm down!
- Open them!
Please calm down!
- Let us go!
Please calm down.
- Please do not do this!
No one is allowed
to leave the city.
King Dhritarashtra
has given the order
that if anyone tries
to leave the city by force
then he shall be imprisoned!
Open the gates...
I request all of you.
Please...
Please return to your homes.
Return to your homes, please!
Our entire family
is outside the city!
Let us go!
- Open the gates!
That is impossible.
The gates of the city
cannot be opened.
The people who are outside
will be imprisoned and punished.
Open them...
- Open the gates!
All of you need to
return to your homes.
Let us go!
- Open the gates!
Open the gates!
- Radheya!
We have to go outside!
Vrushali!
Are you leaving
the city as well?
I had left with father
the first time
but fate brought me here again.
My father is outside the city
and he is alive.
Please let me go to him.
Just like me, the families
of these people
are also outside the city gates.
Why has His Highness given
an order to separate families?
No one can leave
one's kingdom, Vrushali.
But if we find happiness there
then why can we not?
Do not argue with me,
Vrushali.
Learn to accept
what you get here as joy.
There was a time
when, instead of accepting
the joy you had
searching for happiness
and seeking joy
was what you
believed in, Radheya.
Pardon me
King Karna.
But maybe
the head a crown adorns
seems to bring about a change
in its way of thinking.
My father was correct
that unrighteousness
resides not in a man
but in his crown.
Pardon me,
King of Anga
but I must open these gates
and go to the other side.
Vrushali, stop.
King of Anga
if you let this maiden go
then we will not be
able to stop anyone.
Vrushali, stop
otherwise you shall
be imprisoned.
Soldier!
Arrest this maiden!
King Karna of Anga!
King Karna of Anga
you had said that your mother
had renounced you
and that you did not
renounce her.
Then what happened today,
King Karna of Anga
that you had to renounce
the righteousness
and values taught
by your mother?
King Karna of Anga
this maiden said
that unrighteousness
resides not in a man
but in his crown.
My father,
my husband
and my son
have a crown on their heads.
That is why,
I request you
to not let the words
of this maiden come true.
Release this maiden.
Release this maiden.
Soldier.
King of Anga!
Do not argue with me,
Dusshasan.
It is the order of a mother.
Aunt Kunti
the order of His Highness
cannot be disobeyed.
I am still the Queen Mother,
dear Dusshasan.
And the order of His Highness
is meant for everyone.
I am
asking to make an exception
only for this maiden
who has a heart
that knows the truth
and also the dignity
to speak it out loud.
I have firm faith
in my brother-in-law.
He will not disregard
my request.
This maiden shall stay
in my protection.
When I leave for the
reverence of Indraprastha
I shall take her to her father.
King Karna of Anga
unrighteousness resides
not in the crown
but in the greed to have one.
Do you regard your greed
to be your duty?
You are very beautiful.
More beautiful than
this doll of mine.
I shall have her married to
a good and handsome Prince.
And you should marry a
handsome Prince too, Princess.
Nakul
in which direction
should we proceed?
There is a very thick forest
towards the South, brother.
Some birds are flying
from the West.
They seem to have
found some wheat.
Hence, there must be villages
and fields in that direction.
We should proceed
in that direction then.
Let's go.
Mother
brother Yudhishthir
there is a village nearby.
We may live there for a while.
But would it be right
to go to a village, Arjun?
What will happen
if someone recognizes us?
We are outside the borders
of the Kuru kingdom, Bheem.
This is the kingdom of Ahichhatra.*
*The ancient capital of Northern Panchala, near Ramnagar village in Uttar Pradesh state.
Apart from guru Drona
and Ashwatthama
who else can recognize us here?
Sages, we shall offer you
security till the next village.
Bless you!
This way, please.
Stop, sages.
Greetings.
- Bless you.
You have no protector
or weapons with you.
Where are the five of you
headed towards?
We are not five.
We have...
We were...
- This is my land
and it is my duty
to protect all of you.
Let's go.
Let me drop all of you
to the next village safely.
This way, please.
But there were
six more people with us.
Five young men and their mother.
We must wait for them.
Five young men and their mother?
Where?
Where are they?
We have to kill him now.
Brother Bheem
mother has ordered us
to stay in hiding.
Besides, we cannot kill
the son of our teacher.
We need to proceed
towards the forest.
Soldiers, look for
those six people!
Where did they go?!
Look for them!
Let's go.
Soldiers, those people
must be trying to hide.
And to look for a person
who is hiding
is the prime duty of a King.
Look for them.
Brother Yudhishthir
proceed to the forest
with mother.
Until all of you
make it to the forest
I shall stay here to keep
an eye on Ashwatthama.
Nakul, Sahadev, make haste.
Arjun, be careful.
Let's go, mother.
Let's go, Bheem.
Soldier, what are you
waiting for?!
Go after them! - We cannot
go beyond this, Your Highness.
That is the forest
of the ogre, Hidimb.
A person who enters it
does not come out alive.
But those people
have entered it.
Maybe they do not know,
Your Highness
that even sunlight does not
penetrate this illusory forest.
They are bound to become
Hidimb's meal, Your Highness.
But it is vital to know
why they were
hiding in this manner.
Who were those six people?
Arjun
are you alright?
Sahadev, that way.
Brother, we are back to
where we started from.
How odd!
Sunlight does not penetrate
this place even during the day.
I think, Ashwatthama
must have left by now.
Now, we should leave
this forest as well.
How odd!
I had ripped a tree out
to clear the path.
But did I
rip a tree out from here
or from somewhere else?
From where did we
enter this forest?
Mother, this way.
Brother Bheem,
we should rest for a while.
Mother must also be tired.
But would it not be safer for us
to leave this forest first?
Would resting here be right,
Yudhishthir?
We can certainly
rest here, mother.
After entering this forest
leaving this place
or resting here
makes no difference.
Besides, now we
cannot leave this forest.
What do you mean?
This is an illusory forest,
Nakul.
Illusory.
Illusory?
Despite being the Empress
of the vast Aryan region
Panchali is working as a maid.
This breaks my heart,
brother Yudhishthir.
Nakul, working as a maid
would have left one sorrowful
had one deemed oneself a slave
and Panchali can
never deem herself one.
Our life of anonymity
is almost over.
Just fifteen more days
and all of us will be free.
I can almost feel our freedom.
A person facing East
can see the sunlight
even before sunrise.
Panchali
why are your apparels torn?
I have left a piece
of my apparel
with another wicked man
so that I do not forget him
when it is time to punish him.
Kichak!
Did he misbehave
with you again today?!
I shall crush
his head this instant!
Not now,
My Lord.
Just like Jarasandha
very few people can slay Kichak.
Everyone knows about this.
If the news
of Kichak's death spreads
then Duryodhan will know that
we are in the city of Virat.
Panchali is correct.
We need to stay anonymous
only for fifteen more days.
Hear all!
The Prince of Kuru
the son of Emperor Dhritarashtra
Crown Prince Duryodhan
is making his entrance!
Welcome,
King of Gandhar.
Welcome,
Crown Prince.
I welcome all of you
to the city of Virat.
King Virat, may there be
appreciation in your prosperity
and might.
Do accept my
sincerest greetings.
Do be seated.
What brings you here,
King of Gandhar?
In the last 500 years,
the royalty of Gandhar
and Hastinapur visiting
the kingdom of Matsya
is something
I have not heard of.
That is completely untrue,
King Virat.
That is a false accusation.
The royalty of Hastinapur
has certainly been
to the Matsya kingdom
and the city of Virat
has also been
a home to it.
When?
A year ago.
For the past one year
the five sons of King Pandu
and their wife
have been in your refuge.
I have given refuge to no one,
King of Gandhar.
King Virat
the sons of Pandu are
offenders of Hastinapur.
If you try to keep them hidden
then you must face
the army of Hastinapur
in a battle.
I fear no one,
Crown Prince.
You are welcome to command
your army to my kingdom.
Your Highness
there is no need for a battle.
Crown Prince
had we known
where the Pandavas are
we would have
brought them to you.
The wife of the Pandavas
has beauty that can
be surpassed by no other.
If an exceedingly
beautiful woman
has been living in your city
for the past one year
then bring her to the court
General Kichak!
My husband has taken
the vow to put an end
to all the evil-doers
of this world.
I am protected by
five mighty Gandharvas.
This is not the court
of Hastinapur, Prince Dusshasan
where women are dragged into!
This is the court of King Virat
where such lowly behaviour
is not permitted.
King Virat!
Stay within your limits!
Do not cross them!
Your Highness
I think
we have no reason to be an enemy
to the kingdom of Kuru.
Crown Prince
in the past one year, whoever
migrated to the city of Virat
shall have to walk in this
very court and show himself.
Until then,
do accept
our hospitality tonight.
But King Virat seems to have
a different opinion
General.
In the kingdom of Matsya
the General and the King do not
have different opinions, Prince.
My decision
is that of His Highness.
Do not worry,
Prince.
Tomorrow at dawn
all the guests and immigrants
shall be present in this court.
Soldiers
order all the immigrants to be
here in the court tomorrow.
What kind of an order is this,
brother Yudhishthir?
We need to be present in the
court at dawn to show ourselves.
King Shakuni
was given a promise
by General Kichak
that he would help him
look for us.
Can Duryodhan
and the King of Gandhar
recognize us
despite our disguise?
An onlooker merely sees
an unfamiliar shape, Nakul.
However, a keen eye always finds
what it is looking for.
Had they casually met us
they would never
have recognized us
but they will indeed recognize
us in this display of people.
If Kichak has made a promise
with such great faith
then he must have discovered
Panchali's true identity.
If that is the case
then why did he not disclose
her identity in the court?
I know of his
nefarious intentions.
If he has discovered
Panchali's true identity
then that wicked man will
try to take advantage of it!
Empress Draupadi,
do accept
my greetings.
I know
who you truly are, Sairandhri.*
*"Female attendant employed in royal female apartments."
You are leading
a life of anonymity
and the five Gandharvas
who protect you
are truly the five Pandavas.
I also know about this.
However,
you do not know
that the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur
has reached this kingdom
in search of all of you.
If he discovers
your true identity
then you will have to go
on an exile for twelve years
Yet again.
Now, only I
can protect you
Draupadi.
Come to my chamber tonight.
I shall think of the ways
to protect you.
Do you understand,
Draupadi?
You are married to five men.
Another husband
should not bother you.
Tomorrow at dawn
if you
and your five husbands
are not compelled
to be at the court by me
then Duryodhan will indeed not
discover your true identities.
I hope you understand
Draupadi.
One more thing.
Do bring some wine with you when
you come to my chamber tonight
Draupadi.
This is an impossible
situation, My Lords.
If I accept
Kichak's indecent proposal
then I shall have to
embrace death.
If I do not accept it
then all of us will have to
go on an exile
for another twelve years
and an additional year
leading a life of anonymity.
Then we shall kill Kichak
and flee from the city.
Yes!
It is merely a matter
of fifteen days.
Our life of anonymity
is almost over.
Can we not hide in the woods
for the remaining days, brother?
We cannot run,
Sahadev.
If we are not present
in the court tomorrow
then everyone will indeed
discover our identities.
Duryodhan will attack King Virat
and King Virat has
given us refuge, Sahadev.
This city has been our home
for the past one year.
Protecting it
is our responsibility.
We cannot let our life of
anonymity go in vain, brother.
It is almost time for the war.
I am eager to crush the heads
of Duryodhan and his brothers!
A delay of another
thirteen years
is intolerable to me.
We must look for another way.
We can find a way out,
brother Bheem
if we ask ourselves
the correct questions.
Does Kichak wish
to have only Panchali
or by helping Duryodhan
is there an additional
motive in his mind?
So,
do you
wish to acquire the throne
of the Matsya kingdom
Kichak?
Indeed.
Virat is weak.
I am the true King.
However, I can
ascend the throne
only when King Virat
and his son Uttar
get killed in a battle.
If I kill him myself
then the subjects
of the Matsya kingdom
will never accept me.
In other words
you must attack
the Matsya kingdom
slay Virat and his son
in the battle
and make me the new King.
If you promise me this
then I shall bring
your offenders to you.
We accept it,
Kichak.
We give our word to make you
the new King.
You can now have a peaceful rest
and await dawn.
There is another ambition
I must fulfill
before dawn.
Kichak must certainly
be plotting
to dethrone King Virat
and I am certain
that his nefarious schemes
are not hidden from the King.
Even if that is true
it still does not help
our case, brother Arjun.
Our life of anonymity
will certainly go in vain.
You are correct,
Sahadev.
However, for eyeing
Panchali lewdly
Kichak needs to be punished.
I have a plan with me.
Uncle
are we truly going to
attack the city of Virat?
No, my darling.
That old geyser
will never attack.
Then why was Kichak
promised so by you,
uncle?
In the path to one's ambitions
do you know
what the biggest obstacle is?
What?
One's greed.
Greed for women and wine.
Kichak has
greed for Draupadi
otherwise he would never have
asked for time till dawn.
He is foolish.
He does not know
that righteousness dwells
within the Pandavas.
Out of the fear of going on
an exile again, the Pandavas
will not forsake their duties
towards Draupadi
and neither will they
ever do so.
In other words
tonight,
the Pandavas
will slay Kichak.
I am awaiting
the sound
of the duel
between Bheem and Kichak
to reach my ears.
Then we shall leave immediately
and make the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas
go in vain.
Who?
Who dared to help me
when I did not ask for any?
It is me, brother.
Pandu.
I do not require your help!
I do not fear anyone.
Do not keep reminding me
that I am blind.
In this world,
each person has some weakness
or the other.
For instance,
someone cannot run very fast
while another,
cannot lift heavy weights.
While one is afflicted
with a malignant disease
another is unable to recall
the things he has learnt.
There are many such examples.
Do you know a person
who has everything?
And that single weakness of ours
is considered the epicenter
of our lives.
This gives birth to sadness
and discontentment in the heart.
Weakness is either
a congenital defect
or is bestowed by fate
but the same weakness,
by the nous of a person
is assumed to be the bounds
not to be overstepped.
But there are some people
who, through their
righteousness and hard work
defeat their weakness.
What is the difference between
such people and others?
Have you ever thought about it?
There is a very simple answer
to it.
A person who does not
let his weakness defeat him
and houses righteousness
in his heart
is able to move
past his weakness.
In other words,
God may give one weakness
but bounds..
Bounds are determined
only by the nous of a person.
Think about it.
Pandu
you are here.
Are you here to help
your elder brother again
so that no one is able
to forget that I am blind?
Am I right?
A king is offered services,
brother
and not aided.
- But I am
not yet a king.
But you are the heir to the
throne of Hastinapur, brother.
The throne has been awaiting
your presence all these years.
A throne is not meant for a king
but a king is meant for it.
Greetings,
brother Dhritarashtra.
Greetings.
And the heir to the throne
is decided by the capability
of a person, brother Pandu.
I am the eldest of this dynasty.
I have immense strength.
I can fire projectiles
guided by sound.
I am skilled with
every weapon.
I have complete knowledge
of all the 'Shastras' and lores.
Then who are you to judge
my competence?
I cannot that,
brother Dhritarashtra.
Only the Chief Minister
has the right to do so.
When the time is right,
he will take the decision.
All I was telling brother Pandu
that words spoken out of time
are worthless like the fruits
picked before they turn ripe.
Allow me to take your leave,
brother Dhritarashtra.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, brother Pandu.
This is the reason..
This is the reason why
he is envious of us, Pandu
because we are the sons
of King Vichitravirya
but he
is the son of a maid!
Son of a maid.
No, brother.
Do not be so hard-hearted.
The three of us
have the same father
and Vidur is also like family
to grandfather and Queen Mother.
Neither does anyone ever doubt
the depth of his knowledge
nor can his devotion towards
Hastinapur be questioned.
And grandfather adores
a particular virtue of his
that he does not sugar coat
the truth while saying it.
Do not call it a virtue
but vice, Pandu.
Anything said to insult a person
is not candidness but an abuse.
An abuse.
But, brother, the truth
insults only that person
who harbours any
false intentions.
You have nothing but
righteousness in your heart.
Then why would you get insulted?
You should always be gleeful,
brother
because a melancholic heart
can never dispense justice
and it is the duty of a king
to uphold justice.
Being gleeful?
I shall be gleeful only after
I am enthroned as king, Pandu.
I am always skeptical, right?
I have always been doubtful
of my next step.
With every sound I hear,
I am filled with disbelief.
I keep looking
for some hidden meaning
in every word I hear, Pandu.
All my life..
All my life, I have believed
in nothing but disbelief, Pandu.
This disbelief gives birth
to loneliness
and this loneliness will end
only when I am
enthroned as king.
No one will be able
to make a sound near me
without my permission
when I shall be declared
as King Dhritarashtra!
Only then..
- All hail the king!
All hail the king!
A kingdom is for the service
of its subjects, brother
and it cannot be run
for a selfish cause.
Besides, loneliness is cured
not by owning a kingdom
but by embracing love.
You need a wife now, brother
who will become your eyes
to rid you of your loneliness.
I do not have the time
to think about marriage, Pandu.
You need not think about it.
Grandfather and Queen Mother
have already thought about it.
By fixing your marriage
with the princess of Gandhar.
I know.
I have heard
that the princess of Gandhar
is unparalleled in beauty
and virtues, brother.
And she has also been
blessed by Lord Shiva
to beget a 100 sons.
You are extremely fortunate,
brother.
The princess of Gandhar
is the fortunate one, Pandu
who is destined to become
the queen of Hastinapur.
My King
after taking a decision
weakening the heart
by means of pain and worry
is but worthless.
I am not worried or sad,
Sudharma.
My heart is burdened
with the feeling of guilt.
I feel as though l have
a great load on my heart.
My King, when you accepted
the proposal of Bhishma
I was filled with anger
but after pondering over it
I feel
that your decision was correct.
With a person like Bhishma
and the army of Hastinapur
waging a war against them would
spell disaster for our subjects.
This decision was made
by a king, Sudharma
but a father still considers
this decision to be wrong.
My King
a father is bound by affection
and affection makes one weak.
Sudharma
look at our daughter
in the garden.
She is frolicking there.
Like a bird that knits its
dreams on the tree of happiness
she has no idea that the tree
is about to be chopped down.
She is a princess, my King.
If she has to make a sacrifice
for the sake of her subjects
then she will do so
with a smile on her face.
But how will I tell my daughter
about this, Sudharma?
That for the sake of happiness
of the subjects of Gandhar
I have given her sadness
for her entire life.
Not now, my King.
Right now, Gandhari is in
a state of bliss
and I cannot see
this bliss
transform into misery.
Let her fate reveal itself
before her.
But when Shakuni returns
from the hunt
what will happen then, Sudharma?
He is very fond of his sister.
He will never accept the fact
that his sister is being married
to a blind person.
Make haste, sire.
The rope is breaking.
Prince, this rope will break.
It cannot take the weight
of two people.
Then I shall let go
of the rope, soldier.
That will save your life.
- No, Prince. No.
Your life is more precious
than mine.
Then you should
let go of the rope.
Let go.
- No.. No..
Let go.
Let go!
I will not marry the son
of a charioteer.
Son of a charioteer!
Is this 'swayamvar' a test of
competence or caste and class?
It is matter of great surprise,
King Drupad
that your daughter
was reminded of my caste
when I was about
to achieve the goal.
It is evident that your daughter
does not want to marry me
but had she not ridiculed
my birth like this
had she not insulted my caste
the entire world would have
been proud of the Princess!
You daughter does not know,
Your Highness
that in this gathering here
she has not only insulted me
but also those
millions of people
whose competence is not
determined by their lineage
but labour and strength!
Your daughter has
has committed a grave sin,
Your Highness.
Committed a grave sin.
Keep quiet and return
to your place, King of Anga!
The decision to whom
to get married
and in which lineage and dynasty
to get married into
is a right that lies
solely with the maiden.
This is not a right, King Drupad
but the arrogance
of your daughter!
You have turned this 'swayamvar
into politics, King Drupad.
We had thought
that to end the enmity
between Kuru and Panchal
you had invited us
but
you solely wanted to insult us!
That is a lie!
I have no knowledge
of any enmity, Prince.
If my intentions were not pure
then this instant
may Lord Surya burn me to ashes!
The 'swayamvar' of a Princess
is never open to beings of all
types and sections of society
Prince.
Otherwise do beings like, 'yaksh,* gandharva,'* ogres
*Fairy, nature-spirits; **Male nature spirits, part animal.
spirits, ghouls and others
not have the competence?
But none of them can come forth
and approach a Princess
for marriage.
Honouring the rules
of a 'swayamvar
is the duty of everyone.
The truth is, by deciding to
participate in the 'swayamvar
King Karna of Anga has broken
the rules of this undertaking.
If this is what you think,
Princess Draupadi
then listen well to this.
I am challenging you
that if you are to get married
you must do so
in this very 'swayamvar
that too with such a person
who emerges victorious here.
Take a look around you,
Princess Draupadi.
Is there anyone who can
achieve this goal?!
I am here.
Did I not tell you
that a person who is
fated to receive alms
reaches the destination somehow?
King Drupad,
there is no one here
who can take part
in this competition.
Is there anyone?
A Prince or a King...
Does anyone want to participate
in this facade
of a 'swayamvar?!
Break that bow!
Destroy that goal, King Drupad!
And take your arrogant daughter
and imprison her in
the corner of a palace forever.
- Kuru Prince!
Prince Duryodhan
King Drupad is grateful to you
for attempting
to break that bow.
You have proved
that it is not yet time for
the bow to be destroyed.
Brother Yudhishthir
he is Vasudev.
You must be aware,
Crown Prince Duryodhan
that the bow of Lord Shiva
was built for many purposes
out of which one was
the 'swayamvar' of Goddess Sita.
Only after the completion
of that task
did that bow break.
This miraculous bow did not
break at your mighty hands
and that can mean
only one thing
that a warrior who can
win this competition
is still present here.
A warrior who can
win this competition
is still present here.
That is why
I request you,
Crown Prince Duryodhan
to allow this 'swayamvar
to be completed.
Your Highness, address
all the Kings present here
for one last time.
I address this gathering
for one last time!
If a King, Crown Prince
or 'Kshatriya' warrior
wishes to demonstrate his might
then he must come forth!
Govind
can a 'Kshatriya' maiden
not get married to 'Brahmins?
She most certainly can.
But only if you want to.
Yes, Govind.
Address the 'Brahmins
this time.
I have firm faith
that my hidden fate
will appear before
the entire world today.
Your Highness
it is said in the 'shastras'*
*Scholar/sacred texts.
that when the might
of 'Kshatriyas' falls short
and the knowledge of the
shastras' is inadequate
then one should turn to
Brahmins' for answers.
King Gadhi's daughter* was married
to Sage Richika* and all of us know about it.
*Parashurama's grandparents.
Your Highness
address all the 'Brahmins
and ask them to take part
in this competition.
But Vasudev
my daughter was born
to become a Queen.
Marrying a 'Brahmin
and asking for alms
does not suit a Princess.
When a fruit gets buried
in the earth
it cuts through it
after some time
and grows into a tree.
If your daughter was born
to become a queen
then she might just
turn a 'Brahmin
into a King.
Nakul, hold on to its string!
How did you come up with the
idea of making kites, Govind?
Upon observing human beings.
The hearts of human beings
also keep soaring like kites
in the winds of desire.
If the string of control
is lost or cut
the heart
gets bruised and broken
in the harsh winds of desire.
It goes insane.
Look at Nakul's kite over there!
Sometimes human beings
lose control over themselves
because of other people.
Govind!
Your hand is bleeding!
Till the string keeps
the kite in control
it does not hurt oneself
but when the kite
starts pulling the string
one ends up cutting one's hand.
Sometimes
the actions of others
leave the heart frazzled
and one is on the verge
of losing control
but at times like these,
staying composed
and keeping
one's heart under control
becomes quite essential.
Is something like this
going to happen to us, Govind?
Can you not see the future?
No, friend.
I had told you
that I can observe
the temperament of a person
and estimate his future actions.
However
after seeing the success
of the Pandavas
the sons of Dhritarashtra must
certainly be up to something
and at a time like this
if you know what is
most precious to you
and safeguard it
you will indeed see the ray of
joy in the darkness of sorrow.
Will you not
stand by us, Govind?
I must leave to protect Dwaraka.
I have got the news
that King Shalv
has left with his army
and is headed towards Dwaraka
to attack it
but I am
always with you.
The string of control
that you had lost
must once again
be in your hands, friend.
Do not lose heart.
I reside in the hearts
of all of you.
If you lose heart
then your Govind
your Krishna
will be lost as well.
The Pandavas!
Three.
All hail His Highness!
Minister Vidur
seeks permission to enter.
Allow him in.
Welcome!
Welcome, my darling
younger brother Vidur!
Greetings.
Greetings,
brother Dhritarashtra.
Your heart will soar
with joy today
when I give you
this piece of news.
I am all ears,
brother.
What happened in the court
of the sons of Pandu
between Duryodhan and them
and how the daughter of Drupad
had to interfere
in the matters of state
was not at all correct
for which both Duryodhan
and I are very sorry.
That is why, inviting Draupadi
to Hastinapur and welcoming her
is what I suggest.
Besides
after Draupadi's marriage
she was not
received warmly by us, Vidur.
That is why, I have
taken the decision, Vidur
that by burying the hatchet
the Pandavas and Draupadi will
be invited to Hastinapur by us.
Draupadi must get the much
deserved respect and welcome
and we will ensure
that she gets it, Vidur.
The great Guru Drona
and his son Ashwatthama
will also be cordially
invited to Hastinapur.
The sons of Pandu and Draupadi
will be invited to Hastinapur
personally by you,
Vidur.
But sister-in-law is not
present here, brother.
What do you mean?
It has been
my experience, brother
that while delivering a news
whenever sister-in-law
is present with you
that news always brings joy.
Minister!
Yes, Your Highness.
Will the Pandavas
be a part of a friendly duel
in this gathering?
No, uncle.
Duels of all sorts
require weapons
and you are
well aware of the natures
of brother Bheem and me.
If there are weapons involved...
No one will use
any weapon, Duryodhan!
That is an order!
The sons of Pandu will be
welcomed warmly by you
and you better not forget that!
Vidur
along with the knowledge
of the 'shastras' and weapons
a game of dice is also
a part of us 'Kshatriyas.
That is why, along with
strength and knowledge
it is essential for a King
to have control over
his fortune as well.
And fortune can be tested
with gambling,
can it not?
That is why,
my son Duryodhan
will organize a game of dice.
Let us see
how much control
one has over one's fortune.
Let us see
how much control
one has over one's fortune.
Go on
and send them the invite.
As you say,
Your Highness.
Uncle, go ahead and play.
Here goes.
Go on...
Twelve.
Look!
I won.
But Your Highness,
you turned the die yourself.
So what?
If we can roll them
with our hands
then why can we not turn them?
Once you roll the dice,
you cannot turn them.
You do not know
how to play this.
You may go.
I will play with My Lord.
My Lord.
My Lord...
Prince Arjun.
What happened,
Subhadra?
Please play 'chausar' with me.
This is the least you can do
for your wife who is with child.
Do you know,
Subhadra?
The actions of a mother
become the values
of the unborn child.
Do you wish to give my child the
values of the game of 'chausar?
My child ought to
learn the values
of love and warfare
and not those
of gambling and drinking.
You will not be able to
teach him the value of love.
That is because,
you do not know it yourself.
You may teach him
warfare instead.
I hope, you will
not fall asleep.
If it is interesting
then I will not.
A labyrinth of this nature
either has five, seven
or nine circles
and each circle has a specialty
that it can be navigated
only in a particular way.
This is a labyrinth
of seven circles.
This is how a warrior navigates
through the seven circles
and enters the middle
of the labyrinth.
The warrior must navigate
through the seven circles again
to come out of the labyrinth.
A different kind of strategy
is used for this.
I hope, you are
listening, Subhadra.
Subhadra...
She fell asleep.
I knew that she would.
She heard how to
navigate into a labyrinth
but
failed to hear the strategy
to come out of it.
She fell asleep before that.
Greetings, Prince.
Minister Vidur of Hastinapur
is here.
His Highness has called you
to the court at once.
Uncle!
What brings uncle here
without informing us earlier?
The fishes shown in this scene
were generated
using computer graphics.
May Emperor Yudhishthir
have undying glory.
May Empress Draupadi
have eternal happiness.
Your Highness,
on behalf of Hastinapur
I have brought these presents.
For this gesture of goodwill
by Hastinapur
a grand temple will be built
in its honour, Minister
because uncle Dhritarashtra
is revered by all of us.
Your Highness,
Hastinapur is organizing
a humble ceremony
to honour you.
It is being held to honour
especially Empress Draupadi.
I have approached you
and Empress Draupadi
to invite both of you
to that ceremony personally.
Various events will be held
there for your entertainment
and at the end of the ceremony
Crown Prince Duryodhan
will
play a game of dice with you.
Before one accepts
such an invitation
the ministers of the court
and the experienced elders
are always consulted with
Minister.
Certainly.
You may certainly
consult with them
Prince Arjun.
What do you suggest,
uncle?
Should we accept
this invitation?
My suggestion!
Soldier!
Leave!
Greetings, uncle!
Bless you!
When a hunter sprinkles
grains on the ground
one must understand
at once, dear
that the hunter has set a trap.
Under no circumstance should
this invitation be accepted.
Under the garb of a ceremony,
that Shakuni
must certainly be weaving
a web of treachery.
Elder brother.
How could you shackle me?
Elder brother,
please set me free!
Elder brother,
please set me free!
Elder brother,
please set me free!
Pardon me, Prince!
Pardon me!
Will you imprison me?
Brother Duryodhan?
Friend!
Can you shackle me?
Duryodhan, my lad!
Imprison me if you dare!
Can you bear the weight
of your sins, Duryodhan?
My lad!
Show me your might, lad!
Shackle me!
The arrest must be made
by yourself, son!
Who is in the prison?
Me?
Or you, brother Duryodhan?
Duryodhan!
What happened?
Why are you screaming?
What happened?
Will someone please tell me
what happened?
I shall grant you sight,
King Dhritarashtra!
See for yourself!
What... What sorcery is this?
What is it that I am seeing?
Take... Take back my sight!
I do not want it!
Forgive me, Krishna!
Forgive me!
My lad!
What happened?
Friend!
What illusion was that, Krishna?
It was not an illusion, Prince.
It was a premonition.
Soon death shall chase you
in the battlefield similarly.
And you shall not
be able to hide.
Because there is no use
running or hiding from death.
The day the spark of justice
shall ignite in the battlefield
right before your very eyes
the entire Kuru clan
will reduce to ashes!
Farewell, King!
General...
Gather the army right away.
Father, I need to avenge
for every insult
that hypocrite
has inflicted on me!
This moment,
we will attack Virat, Father!
We will attack for sure!
Are you still dreaming
about attacking, Prince? - Yes.
The foolish attempt you had made
to incarcerate Vasudev...
That moment...
That very moment,
we became incapacitated.
Forever and ever!
If you still have
some sense left in you, go...
Go and ask Vasudev
for forgiveness.
Thats impossible, Minister!
I...
I can never ask anyone
for forgiveness.
Never can I ask!
Will I get scared
of that devious person
who like a juggler
sets a bewitching trap?
I...
I...
Ill finish him!
Whether or not he chooses
to fight in the battle
I...
I will for sure
put an end
to that graziers life!
I will surely do away with him!
Friend...
Dont take a decision
out of anxiety, friend.
Be calm and take a decision.
- Keep quiet!
I used to consider
you to be competent and strong!
Is this your strength?
When that cheat
was setting a trap
what were you doing
to protect me?
What were you doing?
Its the duty
of the chief of army
to protect his king and prince.
But you remained seated
like a helpless woman!
All of you are weak!
Weak is what all of you are!
All of you
are just a bunch of cowards!
Nothing else!
But I dont need anybody!
Nobody at all!
Im capable enough
to take my revenge on my own!
Yes, on my own!
Im capable enough!
Duryodhan...
Duryodhan!
Duryodhan has lost his senses!
Your Highness, Dhritarashtra!
Stop your son
else, he will be the cause
for a catastrophe!
Your Highness,
Vasudev is still in the kingdom.
He will be taking rest
in my chamber for some time.
Your Highness
please walk in,
and ask him for forgiveness.
Brother...
Please do this favour on me
for one last time.
Let it be, Vidhur.
Let it be.
Let this battle take place.
Not my righteousness
not Guru Dronas teachings
neither the deceit of
the King of Gandhaar
nor the archery skills
of Anga Raj...
No one...
No one can protect
the Kauravas now.
All of us are now
approaching our end.
Krishna...
Did Duryodhan try to incarcerate
you in the court of assembly?
Destiny paves its way.
Humans only play a role
in executing destiny's plan
by using their intelligence
and culture.
Sister-in-law wishes
to apologise to you
on behalf of the sins
her sons have committed.
Greetings, Your Highness!
If you must
then apologise to your sons
to whom you didn't impart
the right teachings
at the right time.
You knew
that His Highness was
empoisoning your sons' minds
with revenge
and futile ambitions.
But still
you let your sons imbibe
the teachings he was imparting.
Now, the situation is such that
Duryodhan has crossed
all his limits.
Don't be resentful
at my sons, Vasudev.
They aren't aware
of the lightning pace at which
they are nearing their death.
No, Your Highness.
Resent is shown on those
who are knowledgeable enough
to make decisions.
Duryodhan's decisions
arise from his ignorance.
How can I be resentful at him?
I only sympathise with him.
Nothing else.
If you sympathise with him
why don't you refrain him
from commencing the battle?
The way fireflies get attracted
to the light of the flame
and get engulfed by it
Duryodhan is facing
a similar situation today.
How can he be stopped?
There must be a way out,
Krishna.
Vasudev, there must be some way
to protect my sons
from self-destruction?
Duryodhan has utmost belief
on Grand sire Bheeshm
Guru Drona
and on the Karna's capability.
Grand sire is helpless
because of his position.
Guru Drona...
He is helpless as he is bound
by the oath he had taken.
But Karna hasn't promised
anything to His Highness.
Karna
is bound by the oath
of friendship with Duryodhan.
Promises made to the king,
Guru, hermit and God
can't be broken at any cost.
But a promise given to a friend
can be broken
if it is
for the friend's well-being.
Please, stop Karna
from taking part in this battle.
I have full faith
that Duryodhan won't
have the courage to go to war.
Nothing is impossible
for you, Vasudev.
As long as a person doesn't...
make a conscious effort
to learn...
it becomes impossible
for even God to enlighten him.
Still...
If Karna's mother makes
an effort, it's possible
that Karna deters
from his decision...
to go to war.
I can accept your proposal,
King Shakuni.
But there's only
one problem.
The great warrior
Karna.
Such a great warrior
cannot be left independent.
Me?
- Yes.
I don't belong to
the warrior class, Emperor.
I'm a charioteer.
I am no king.
Charioteer or warrior...
It makes no difference to me.
You are devoted to your friend
and not towards me.
The mightiest emperor
is the one
to whom even skilled warriors
surrender their arms.
I hand over a kingdom Malini* to you.
*Malinipuri.
You will be its king.
And will swear allegiance
to me.
Any plant that is going to
yield sweet fruits in future
is to be planted
in my orchard.
And not in
anyone else's orchard.
I apologise, Emperor.
I do not wish
to take up
the responsibility
of a kingdom.
I have returned
an acquired kingdom.
Maybe King Shakuni
compelled you to
renounce the kingdom.
So that a skilled warrior
remains independent
and carry out his orders
and not mine.
Great warrior Karna
I am a wrestler.
A wrestler!
Not a moron.
You will surrender
as a king
and only then can this plan
be successful.
Friend
there is a very complex
situation in front of us.
What do we do now?
I request to you,
friend.
Don't ask me
for anything
that becomes a burden
for me.
My child
It's important
to stop Karna.
I am afraid
Vasudev Krishna
is on his way
to Magadh
with the intention
to attack.
At that time
Karna protecting you,
will not be enough.
He has to be there to protect
Emperor Jarasandh.
Or else
the entire plan
will be down the drain.
But, uncle
how do I persuade him?
Go tell him
that the ones who go
to the ocean
in search of a pearl
keep themselves
tied to the boat.
Now that you are in a pact with
an unrighteous emperor
like Jarasandh
then it is necessary
that he keeps you
tied to righteousness.
Or else
you will drown
in the ocean of unrighteousness.
You have done me many a favour,
friend.
If I'm able to repay
them in this life
I will be satiated.
I will not be able to take
any more of this burden.
Don't say that, Karna.
I have not done you
any favour.
Whatever you got was
the result of
your capability
and knowledge.
You considering me
your friend
makes me feel honoured.
Friend...
- Let me complete, friend.
The other day,
out of anger
I had called you
a charioteer.
I am a charioteer, friend.
I'm the son
of a charioteer.
And Vrushali explained
to me
that if I continue to see my
birth as an embarrassment
then I will never be
happy in life.
You addressed me
as a charioteer's son.
I hold no anger for that.
- You may not.
But I'm angry
with myself.
Do you know why, Karna?
Do you know why
I am angry with myself?
Because I know what
righteousness is.
But I'm unable to walk the
path of righteousness, friend.
I end up insulting
my friend.
I end up committing
a lot of unrighteous deeds.
You stop me,
yet I commit.
The sins I commit
are like a crack
in the wall
that keeps deepening
by the day.
Your path maybe
impure, friend
but your intentions
are not.
You are fighting
against injustice.
Do you know, friend?
You know, the day
I'm able to resolve injustice
I'll be able to walk the path
of righteousness.
Do you have faith,
my friend?
I have complete faith.
But if uncle's plan
fails to succeed today
then it will never succeed.
This crack of
unrighteousness
will tear my life apart,
friend.
I require your support,
friend.
Yes.
Yes, I'm being selfish.
But won't you stand
by me today?
Unrighteousness can
be eradicated, friend
but only with the help
of your faith.
Will you support me?
Regardless of if a horse
is pulling a chariot or not
but till he dons a bridle
he cannot be considered free.
Get lost, charioteer!
Listen to your father
for he is aware that
a charioteer is incompetent.
Go away, charioteer!
Go away.
Go away, charioteer!
If this young archer
is a king
the he can challenge Arjun.
I
Emperor of the Kuru lineage,
Dhritarashtra
right away, declare
this young boy
the king of Anga.
The entire Hastinapur's army is
there to protect your friend.
But only you can protect
me and my harmony, lord.
Prince, I accept to
bear the king's orders
and at the king's feet
I vow
that hereafter
my property
and even my life
will forever be at your
feet, Prince.
If needed
you can wear the crown
once again.
I accept
your orders, Prince.
What happened, Madhav?
Why did you stop?
King Shakuni.
There isn't another man as
intelligent as King Shakuni
in the entire Arya dynasty,
Parth.
But unfortunately, he uses
his intelligence
for his selfish purpose
and not for benevolence.
What do you mean?
I didn't get you.
Circumstances have
changed, Parth.
Now, we will not be able to
gain victory over Magadh.
What do you mean?
Won't we kill Jarasandh,
Vasudev?
Now that depends on you,
Bheem.
I have heard that
as a child
that you had learnt to wrestle
from Magadh's wrestlers.
Do you remember
any techniques?
Definitely.
A lot of them.
Then the death of Jarasandh
is definite, Bheem.
But now
the princes of Indraprastha
cannot enter Magadh.
A Brahmin wrestler
will now have to
enter Magadh.
Oh, Lord Bhairav!*
*"Terrible" or "Frightful", sometimes known as Kala Bhairava, is the fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.
Oh, Lord Mahakaal!*
*The Destroyer of one who destroys.
Please accept the sacrifice
of 100 rulers.
May I be blessed with
the life and the power
of these kings.
Get those
disciples of Krishna!
In the place meant
for the Rajsuya Yajna
why is he planning to carry
out a sacrifice?
If he wants to
kill those kings
then why doesn't he
kill all of them at once?
My child
sacrificing men is considered
very pious at Magadh.
And that is why Jarasandh
is considered a sinner
by the entire Arya dynasty.
Uncle!
I have an extraordinary news.
The Pandavas were approaching
Magadh with their army.
Suddenly they changed
their path.
The army changed
its path!
Surprising!
They must have
gotten scared.
My child, if a leaf flying with
the winds changes its path
it can be considered abrupt.
But
if a bird
changes its path
it is considered
a strategy.
I'm unable
to understand
what Vasudev Krishna
has as a strategy.
Hail King Jarasandh!
Hail King Jarasandh!
Hail King Jarasandh!
Hail King Jarasandh!
Hail King Jarasandh!
Madhav
we've to stop the kings
from being sacrificed.
That's very simple, Parth.
Jarasandh
cannot ignore a challenge
to wrestle.
That forms the core
of his maxims.
Emperor Jarasandh
an animal sacrificed
during a yajna
is first fed well.
Only the sacrifice which
is completely satiated
adds to one's merit.
Won't you give
your sacrifices
an opportunity to
feel contentment
before their death?
Nothing can give contentment
to a person
who is about to die.
- That's untrue, Emperor.
For the worshippers
of bravery
to witness your art
of wrestling
is the biggest reason
of contentment
and that's what I have heard.
This friend of mine
Vrikodar
challenges you for
a wrestling match.
I don't have the time now.
The auspicious moment for the
sacrifice is at hand, Brahmins!
You denied the challenge
of wrestling?
Friend, it's a very happy
moment for us.
We won!
Now you can tell all the
wrestlers of the Arya dynasty
that Emperor Jarasandh
did not accept
your challenge.
This is a very happy moment.
Let's go.
Stop!
First try to displace my leg.
Then you can dare
to challenge me.
Which leg, Emperor?
Don't be too proud.
Any of them.
I have come to Magadha
to displace both your legs.
Who are you?
After having consumed
the food
you don't question about
the cook's caste
Emperor Jarasandh.
You have accepted
the challenge.
Now you'll have
to wrestle.
Vasudev Krishna!
Greetings.
Pandu's son Bheem
is very excited
to have a wrestling
match with you.
Your Highness
why did you halt
the chariot here?
The first time
I had entered Hastinapur...
It was on a chariot.
But
this time
I am the culprit of Hastinapur.
I couldn't protect
its King.
I have no right to enter
riding on this chariot.
- Your Highness
even today, you are
the Queen of Hastinapur.
And the future Queen Mother.
Who has ever known
what the womb
of the future
gives birth to, Vidur?
Hence I request you,
Your Highness
enter the kingdom
as the Queen.
15 years earlier when
you had gone to the forest...
Those circumstances
don't exist anymore,
Your Highness.
Today, against
these five boys
a 100 boys are
standing there.
If you surrender your
rights, Your Highness
then the rights of your sons
too will be lost.
That which is lost
is ambition.
Not rights.
My husband has
taught my sons
the right values.
Sons
come here.
Yes, mother.
- Yes, mother.
This Hastinapur
is your house.
Henceforth
your father figure will be
your grandfather
Bhishma. Dhritarashtra
will be your uncle.
And Gandhari, your aunt.
Serving them will be
your duty.
Here, you have
a 100 brothers.
Be loving towards them.
Reciprocating their love
will be your duty.
Here, there will be no
differentiation between
Gandhari's 100 sons
and Kunti's five sons.
Here
there will be the 105 sons
of the Kuru clan.
These are the Pandavs.
The five Pandavs.
Because of them
you couldn't be coronated
as the Crown Prince.
But you yourself had
advised His Highness
that my coronation
cannot take place now.
My dear!
My dear
I had to say this
because of that old man.
He says
that he will not
be partial.
But he and Vidur,
the maid's offspring...
These two people
love these five Pandavs
a lot.
Always remember
that they are
not your brothers
but your enemies.
Enemies!
May God give you patience
and faith, child.
Grandsire
these are
my five sons.
I've brought them here
for your guardianship.
- No, Kunti
please don't say that.
They are not outsiders.
This is rightfully their home.
Come.
May you have a long life.
May you have a long life.
May God bless you, Kunti.
May God bless your children too.
May you have a long life.
Greetings.
May you have a long life.
Your Majesty
it's time for your sister-in-law
to enter the temple.
The priests are waiting
for her.
Let's go, Kunti.
The attendants will take
the children into the palace.
Before entering the palace,
even you have to
perform the purgation ceremony
and then, the ritual
of entering the temple.
Let's go, Kunti.
Bheem, stop making fun of him.
Get up, attendant. It's Bheem's
habit to make everyone laugh.
Call your companion wrestler.
- Come here.
It's the Prince's order.
Are you a wrestler, attendant?
- Yes, Prince.
I'm a wrestler from Magadh.
I live in the residence
for Magadhis.
If I come to your place
will you give me some lessons
in wrestling?
But, Prince, the princes
who belong to this place
don't follow
our style of wrestling.
We do it in a lively
and rural style.
We apply oil and soil
to our bodies.
Attaining that knowledge
is also important.
What if we ever
have to wrestle in Magadh?
Where will I get an expert
master like you?
Attendants,
you have finally come.
Hurry up.
Bring our footwear.
At the orders of His Excellency
we're now attending
to these princes, Prince.
I'm not talking to you!
I'm talking to these
five attendants.
The ones who are friends
with the servants
are servants themselves.
Come on...
Greet us!
Of course.
Nakul and Sahadev,
Dushashan is elder to you.
Greet him.
It's a must for the younger ones
to greet the elders.
It's not the matter
of being elder.
It's about superiority
and inferiority.
The sons of King Dhritarashtra
never greet anyone
rather, everyone else greets us.
All five of you will greet
the 100 of us right now
and forever after!
Pay your respect
to the sons of the King.
Even we are the sons
of the King.
Their father was the King
of the woods.
He used to rule over animals
and birds.
The coronation ceremony
in Hastinapur
was conducted for our father.
If you have a doubt
then enquire about it.
- Bheem, don't argue.
We will definitely greet you
but I hope you are aware
of the fact
that the one who doesn't
have the right to be greeted
becomes a sinner
if he is greeted.
Doesn't the Prince have
the right to be greeted?
There's only one prince
in the kingdom.
And there is only one prince
and that's me.
My younger brothers will greet
all of you
but before that
Yudhishthir should greet
me first.
Has the coronation ceremony
been conducted for you,
brother Duryodhan?
When?
Durbhiksh will tell us
when his coronation ceremony
as the Prince was conducted.
Attendants, you may go.
- At the order of His Excellency
we're attending to
these princes, Prince.
We can't leave them here
and we'll have to answer
to their questions.
The coronation ceremony has not
yet been conducted, Bheem.
I don't require a coronation.
It's only my right to be
enthroned as the Prince.
It is my birth right.
Duryodhan
only the presence of clouds
in the sky
doesn't make the earth wet.
The clouds
can be easily blown away
by strong winds
and the same is applicable
to one's rights.
So, intelligent people
do not display their rights
until the appropriate time.
Yudhishthir is the eldest
among you.
First of all,
all of you, greet Yudhishthir.
Pay your respects to him.
It's my order.
Duryodhan!
King Drupad
the deities of this 'yajna
will fulfill your wishes.
Your fate and the betterment
of the Aryan region's future
lies with the children
born from this 'yajna.
What happened, Arjun?
There is someone in the bushes,
brother Yudhishthir.
I think, an animal
is proceeding towards us.
Greetings.
Who are you and what has
reduced you to this condition?
We hail from Panchal.
The King of Panchal, Drupad,
had imprisoned us.
We have fled from his captivity.
Do begin.
Sages, do accept
my heartfelt apologies.
No
you need not apologize.
We were terrified.
Hence, we were in hiding.
Though sages should not
get frightened
but when a mighty person
tortures people, fear becomes
a part of
a weak person's nature.
Who torture sages
in this region?
This is a grave sin.
The King of Panchal, Drupad.
But he is not at fault.
When anger and greed
take over a person's heart
righteousness
is the first virtue
to be expunged.
The fire of his insult
is burning him.
A son who can behead Drona
is what he is asking for.
And His Highness also wishes
to defeat the sons of Pandu.
In order to defeat
the five Pandavas
he is asking for just one son?
Did he get such a son?
We were unable to perform
such a 'yajna
but the great sages Yaja
and Upayaja saved us.
By sacrificing all the merits
they had earned
they have asked for a son
from the Almighty for Drupad.
At the moment, such a 'yajna
is being performed in Kampilya.
The Gods are pleased with
your sacrifices, King Drupad.
It is now time for
the fulfillment of your wishes.
It is now time for
the fulfillment of your wishes.
Ask for the kind of son
your heart has been
dying to have, King Drupad.
A son is one
who deems the ambitions
of his father as his fate.
By sacrificing my sword,
I ask for a son
whose anger is
as sharp as a sword!
By sacrificing my armour,
I ask for a son
whose pride
is indestructible
like an armour!
By sacrificing my blood, I ask
for a son
whose entire being
is laced with vengeance!
I wish for a son
who will behead Drona
and place his head at my feet!
King Drupad
dhrishta' means steady
and 'dyumna' means light.
His glory will be everlasting
and you have been blessed
with such a son
by the Gods!
His name will be Dhrishtadyumna!
My son Dhrishtadyumna!
My son Dhrishtadyumna!
My son Dhrishtadyumna!
Give me your blessings, father
so that I follow your orders
and be prepared to even
sacrifice my life.
May you live long.
May you be invincible!
Come and embrace your father.
My son Dhrishtadyumna.
But why did all of you
not perform such a 'yajna?
We do not have as much merits
as great sages Yaja and Upayaja.
We would not have been
able to give a son to Drupad
who is not destined to be his.
He is destined to have
only a daughter.
What do you mean?
- Great sage Upayaja had said
she will change
not only the fate of Panchal
but also that of
the entire Aryan region.
Greetings, mother.
Today, you have returned
to your mother, son.
No, mother.
Today, I am here to bathe
in your holy water
to wash away my sin.
You are my son, Devavrata.
You cannot commit a sin.
But I have committed
a sin, mother.
To secure the future
of Hastinapur
I have sacrificed
the happiness of a maiden.
I did not even ask her
what she wanted.
Whether Gandhari was ready
to accept a blind husband..
I made no effort
to find out about it.
Did she protest, my child?
Not explicitly
through words but
her oath to keep her eyes
covered for life
is a form of her protest,
mother.
When you had taken an oath,
Devavrata
were you filled with protest
back then?
After so many years..
Why are you asking me
this question, mother?
Look within your heart, son.
There are moments in life
when we are compelled
to engage in retrospection.
This is termed as
bathing in river Ganges.
No, mother.
I can say with
complete authenticity
that while taking the oath,
I had nothing
other than concern
for my father's happiness
and the integrity of Hastinapur
in my heart.
And even today, I feel so.
Had Gandhari objected
to the marriage
would you have attacked
the kingdom of Gandhar?
No, mother.
Your son would never disrespect
the wish of any woman.
Then you are innocent, son.
You have only carried out
your duty.
Sometimes, it is my duty
to breach my banks
to destroy the old
and initiate regeneration.
But when my flood waters recede
the earth becomes more fertile
and nourished.
Similarly in life,
some duties are also agonizing
but they give birth
only to happiness.
I too have just one wish
from the Lord, mother
that may He bless Dhritarashtra
and Gandhari with happiness.
By making such a big sacrifice
Gandhari has undoubtedly
set a new standard
to being a devoted wife.
What Kripacharya said
was absolutely true.
This palace has seen
many instances of sacrifices
being made by wives.
Was our sacrifice not enough?
The question is whether
what Gandhari did is a sacrifice
or a protest.
No.
I do not see this..
- What you and I see in this act
is irrelevant.
The perspective of Dhritarashtra
is what is important.
Gandhari.
I am right here, my Lord.
I know that.
Just by listening
to one's breathing I can know
how many people are present
in a chamber and where.
Come to me, Gandhari.
What?
Alright, my Lord.
If you go in that direction, you
will never be able to reach me.
You will bump into the pillar.
Come here.
Where..
Where are you, my Lord?
Just look at your foolishness.
If you cannot even tell
where I am
how could you cover your eyes?
What did you have in mind?
lnsulting me or making
a mockery of yourself?
I just want to be in the same
situation as you, my Lord.
How could you..
How could you believe..
How could you believe
that by covering your eyes
you could become blind?
I can see with every inch of me.
Gandhari
how could you be so arrogant
about your vision
that you deem the blind
to be helpless?
Not helpless, my Lord.
I consider you different
from the rest.
And I am trying to adapt
to this variation. - Fool!
What do you think?
That I wish for a court
full of blind people?
That after becoming the king
I will order everyone
to cover their eyes forever?
What most people cannot see
with their eyes
is what I can without them.
That is why, quit all this drama
and take off that cloth
from your eyes!
No, my Lord.
Do not say so.
Life becomes hell for a person
who breaks an oath.
If, because of this oath
I refuse to accept you
then will your life
not become a living hell?
To help one's wife
carry out her oath
is the duty of a husband,
my Lord.
And to carry out
the orders of a king
is the duty of every subject.
If, after my coronation,
I order you to uncover your eyes
then will you not do so?
I shall uncover my eyes then,
my Lord.
If I get such an order
I shall uncover my eyes
while stepping into the fire.
This means..
This means
you will not listen to me
under any circumstance.
And what is all this?
Where are you ear-rings?
Where are your bangles?
And why are you
wearing this garland?
M-My lord
I have adorned myself
with flowers
so that you may..
- Enough, Gandhari!
Enough.
Enough of insulting me.
Just because I cannot see
your jewellery
you have gone to this limit
to remind me of my blindness?
Have you forgotten that you are
the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru dynasty?
You will have to grace
the throne of Hastinapur.
Will you do so in the garb
of a female monk?
Has covering your eyes
made you believe
that the people in the court
will not be able to see you?
Or do you wish to keep reminding
the subjects of Hastinapur
that you have
met with injustice?
Is it not so, my Lord.
- It is so, Gandhari.
It is so.
You have come here
only to insult me.
As per the tradition
I had brought this ornament
for your hair, Gandhari.
It is the symbol of privilege
for every woman.
But you are unworthy of it.
You are unworthy.
You are nothing
but my abjection.
Nothing but my abjection!
I
son of King Vichitravirya,
Dhritarashtra
reject you.
The whole of Hastinapur
may consider you its queen
but I
will never accept you
as my wife.
Never!
Never.
From the beginning of time,
one particular question
has always bothered man.
When it comes to relationships,
gaining maximum happiness
and keeping sadness at bay
is the primary motive.
Have all your relationships
given you
complete satisfaction?
Think about it.
Our life is based
on relationships.
Our security is based
on relationships.
That is why, the basis
of all happiness in our life
is also a relationship.
Then why do we meet with grief
when it comes to relationships?
And why are struggles
born from relationships?
Have you ever thought about it?
When a person does not accept
the work or belief of another
and tries to bring about
a change in it
a struggle is born.
In other words,
the more one refuses
greater is the struggle.
And the more one accepts,
greater is the happiness.
Is it not the truth?
If man willingly
restrains his expectations
analyzes his thoughts
and instead of trying to change
another person
tries to bring about change
in oneself
then is achieving
satisfaction in relationships
that difficult a task?
In other words
is acceptance not the true
meaning of relationships?
Think about it.
King Dhritarashtra.
Now, even Dhritarashtra is
getting impatient to hear this.
And this impatience is what
I fear, Queen Mother.
Dhritarashtra has excessive
greed to rule the kingdom.
He dreams of filling his void
of blindness, his inadequacy
by ruling this kingdom.
Who does not go
through this, Bheeshma?
Dhritarashtra is
not at fault here.
Mother, I..
I am empathetic towards
Dhritarashtra's situation
but he has not yet been able
to accept his condition.
And if a person cannot
rise above one's pain
how will he understand the pain
of his subjects as a king?
We have no other alternative,
Bheeshma.
Dhritarashtra is the eldest son
of the Kuru dynasty.
The eldest.
But you should also understand
that he is blind.
If he doesn't become the king,
then what will he do?
He cannot become the General
or the Chief Minister.
His life will be
wasted then, Bheeshma.
As the General,
Pandu will lead the army
and protect him and the kingdom.
Vidur has extensive knowledge.
He will guide Dhritarashtra.
Will Dhritarashtra appoint Vidur
as the Chief Minister,
Queen Mother?
If, after becoming the king
he does not appoint someone
as the Chief Minister, then
neither will I be able to
disobey his orders
nor will you.
After the coronation ceremony,
the orders of a king
become the will of the Almighty.
Then before
the coronation ceremony
I will declare Pandu
as the General
and Vidur as the Chief Minister.
But to keep Hastinapur
as an integrated entity
it is important to coronate
Dhritarashtra as the king.
Bheeshma
my decision to coronate
Dhritarashtra as the king
may not be palatable to you
but it is still
the correct decision.
Listen to me, Bheeshma.
Greetings, sire.
Welcome, Vidur.
Before swearing in
as the Chief Minister
have you come here
to take my blessings?
I have come to ask for
your permission.
Permission?
Regarding what, son?
To release me.
Release me from the duty
of taking
such an oath, sire.
The royal family of Hastinapur
has given the son of a maid
a great deal of love
shown him a lot of respect
and great faith, sire.
Vidur, you are the son
of King Vichitravirya
as are Dhritarashtra and Pandu.
I have never differentiated
among the three of you.
Nevertheless
they are the sons of queens,
sire.
If our reputation
ever gets tarnished
then I will be the first one
to be blamed
not them.
You are my disciple, son.
You would never do anything
to jeopardize our reputation.
After swearing in
as the Chief Minister
when it is time to decide
between righteousness and love
what should I choose,
sire?
Righteousness is like the sun
and love is like the moon.
If you choose love,
you will get comfort
but also the darkness
of the night.
If you choose righteousness,
there will be light
for you, your family
and for the subjects
of our kingdom.
Go on, Vidur.
Go and swear in
as the Chief Minister
and carry out your duties
with righteousness.
As you say, sire.
Goodbye.
May you live long.
Son, may Hastinapur
always be protected by you
and may you
always be victorious.
May your enemies shudder at
the very mention of your name.
May you be immortalized
in history, son.
May the rank of the General
of Hastinapur
shine like its throne.
No other rank has the authority
to shine like the throne.
I know,
yet I shall pray
for your rank to shine on.
For a mother, her child's
success is her only happiness.
I, a descendant
of the Hastin dynasty
the grandson
of King Shantanu
and the son
of King Vichitravirya
take up the reins of
the kingdom of Hastinapur
in my hands today.
I shall extend the boundaries
of Hastinapur
to the very limits
of the region of Arya.
I shall take the reputation
of the Kuru dynasty
beyond the limits of the sky.
Hastinapur will have more wealth
than Lord Kuber himself.
All the kings
of the region of Arya
shall bow before
the throne of Hastinapur.
I.. - 'All hail
King Dhritarashtra!
All hail King Dhritarashtra!
King Dhritarashtra!
Today, I take the oath
that..
Who dares to interrupt
my speech?
In reality a human isn't
bound by his deeds.
The expectations linked to
those deeds bind him.
How so, Krishna?
If you hope to be victorious
in this war
then you shall feel
immense sorrow upon defeat.
And that sorrow shall compel you
to do something else
for which you need to
be born again.
If you are victorious
your arrogance shall grow.
And that arrogance
shall drive you towards
worldly triumph.
It shall make you kill
and the sin ought to it
shall bind you.
Think about it!
If in this battle
you have no desire to win
and have no fear of losing
would you feel bliss or sorrow
at the end of this war?
Neither bliss, Krishna
nor sorrow.
Therefore your bliss, sorrow
hopelessness, disappointment,
arrogance
aren't due to the war.
The expectations that you have
from the war
shall cause them.
Is it not true, Arjun?
Therefore, holding joys
and sorrows as equals
without thinking of
gain, loss, victory or defeat
if you engage in battle,
O' son of Kunti
you shall not bear any sins.
This is called 'Karma Yoga'.
The one who attains
the knowledge of 'Saankhya
realises the fact
that he isn't a body
but a mere soul.
That the bliss and experiences of
the body are only until death.
And therefore, aren't real,
but just illusions.
For him becoming a 'Karma Yogi
becomes easier.
But, Krishna
if deeds are meant to restrain
isn't it wise to renounce
the world
and embrace sainthood?
Such thinking is the sole reason
for this war today, Arjun!
Ponder over it.
When the ones possessing 'Gunas
and the ones who know justice
give up deeds
then the ones full of injustice
run the world.
Had Grandsire Bhishma
not renounced the world
injustice wouldn't have
grown so vast today.
And had your father
not gone on an exile
brother Yudishtir would be
reigning in peace today
and would be teaching
his subjects
about justice and righteousness.
But Arjun, the sad truth is
that only the virtuous ones
can benefit the world.
But they are the ones
who often think of sainthood.
Just as water drifts away
as steam
and did keeps lying
right there, similarly
the virtuous and learned ones
give up the world
and unjust ones possessed by
Tamas' function in the world.
Ought to this very reason sins
and injustice grow in the world.
But 'Karma Yoga
protects this world
from this bizarre situation!
A 'karma Yogi' gives up
expectations of an outcome
but not the deeds themselves.
He stays in this very world
like a saint.
He performs all actions
but doesn't lose himself in one.
A 'Karma Yogi' expects nothing
from his children,
from his dear ones
and even his subjects at all.
He himself reaps the benefits
of sainthood.
But he benefits the world
like a familial head.
A human toils for the well being
of his off-springs.
How can he not expect joy
from his own off-springs?
Whatever a human does
for his children
is it a transaction
or an act of love?
Love, Krishna.
Then why expect an outcome
for his deeds, Arjun?
Future gains are measured
in a transaction
and not in love.
The human who moulds
his children's character well
and bestows the virtues of
love and justice upon them
his children shall surely give
him love and protection.
The deeds of one's children
and the behaviour of dear ones
reflect one's own deeds, Arjun.
And when one has no rights
upon their deeds
what is the use of having hopes
and expectations from them?
If you think deeply, Arjun,
you shall realise soon
that there is no deed in life
to which linking hopes
and expectations is inevitable.
When the creation is God
and human is a fragment of God
all actions are caused
by God himself.
A human does nothing on his own.
This is the base principle
of 'Karma Yoga', Arjun.
Hence it is necessary
that you become a 'Karma Yogi
and fight this battle, Arjun.
By giving up three 'Gunas
be free of them, Arjun.
Be free of this dilemma!
Always think for 'Sattva
which is the Lord himself
and continue with your duties.
The desire to achieve something
and the thought of defending
something that was achieved
must be given up, Arjun
and liberate your soul.
Remember, Arjun.
Your right is only
to commit deeds.
The outcome relies on the Lord.
Therefore neither is it right
to run from deeds
nor is it right to expect
a return for your deeds.
The one who gives up
on outcomes
but does not give up deeds
how can such a 'Karma Yogi
be recognised, Krishna?
Look, Arjun?
The one who gives up food
just to escape its taste
in reality the craving for taste
never leaves his mind.
He faces a twofold loss.
For one he becomes weak
due to which the inevitable
effort of attaining the Lord
cannot be done by him.
And secondly
his mind is always full
of craving for taste.
Hence rather than giving up food
one better gives up
the craving for taste itself.
A 'Karma Yogi' draws out
all cravings in his mind.
He accepts life as his duty
and does function.
But he is never in harmony
with his actions.
And Arjun
the one who has no hopes and
expectations from his actions
are the one whose motives
are fulfilled.
The one whose mind doesn't
falter even after one failure
The one who doesn't think he is
most superior after one success
such a person is called
a 'Karma Yogi'.
And such a person succeeds
in life repeatedly.
Wishes arise out of expectations
of outcome.
And it is a characteristic of
wishes to stay unfulfilled.
Unfulfilment gives rise
to anger.
And anger gives rise to desire.
Due to desire a person
forgets the knowledge
of behaviour and interaction.
Loss of knowledge causes
loss of virtue.
Inappropriate actions
take place.
And the society becomes
an enemy of such a person.
And in the end such a person
meets complete downfall.
Like for brother Duryodhan
his Commander-in-chief
Grandsire
is his enemy
and he blessed you
to emerge victorious.
Arjun
dutifulness is the second step
towards the divine knowledge.
Strengthen your faith
in the Almighty.
Know your own self.
Break free from the shackles
of bondage.
Sacrifice the desire of the
outcome and do only your duty.
By strengthening my faith
in the Almighty
how can I become dutiful?
Arjun, due to 'Sankhya Yoga
a human keeps reminiscing
the Almighty.
Reminiscing the Almighty
gives birth to a sense
of submission.
And this sense is called
devotion.
Devotion enlightens a human
about what is right and wrong.
And that knowledge gives him
a glimpse of the Almighty.
The one who gets a glimpse
of the Almighty
he becomes the most Dutiful.
He is freed from the circle of
rebirth and attains salvation.
That is the ultimate aim
of all souls
and the pinnacle
of righteousness.
But how will I submit
without a glimpse
of the Almighty, Madhav?
To get a glimpse of the Almighty
get rid of
greed, pride, anger
and prejudice.
If a person sitting in
a dark room says
that he wants to see the Sun
what will you suggest him?
Won't you tell him to come out
of the room
and stand under an open sky?
Sun is already present there!
Similarly, Arjun, this universe
is the Almighty.
The Almighty is everything.
Nothing else other from Him.
The one who sees his soul
sees the Almighty.
Like the taste of
a single granule of salt
is indifferent from
the taste of the ocean
similarly
a soul is indifferent
from the Supreme Soul.
That means, Madhav
are you the Almighty?
Yes, Arjun.
I am the Almighty.
Just like you are.
But you aren't enlightened
about it
unlike me.
So, Madhav
why isn't submission before you
regarded submission before God?
Absolutely.
Submission before me is
submission before the Almighty.
Sacrifice everything
and seek my refuge, Arjun.
I am the universe.
I am present in every aspect
of the universe.
I am the Sun and I am the moon.
I am present in all the
constellations and planets.
I am more ancient than the Sun
and as new as
a blossoming flower.
I am the human race.
I am the power that creates
heaven and hell.
I am Duryodhan.
And I am Arjun too.
How is that possible, Madhav?
People have witnessed
your birth.
Your mother is still alive.
You took birth from her womb.
How can you be, both,
ancient and modern?
You are seeing the body
and I talk of the soul.
I have been born innumerable
times, Arjun.
I have many avatars.
I have taken up many forms
and have died right here!
And I will take many births
in the future, as well.
Whenever righteousness is harmed
whenever the
evil raises its hood
in order to rescue the righteous
to annihilate the evil
and to re-establish
righteousness, I'll take birth.
This has happened in every age
and will continue to happen
in future, as well.
I am the Almighty!
I was the Matsya avatar*
*The fish that kills Damanaka to save the vedas and also saves Manu from a great flood that submerges the entire Earth.
and the Vamana avatar.*
*The dwarf that grows into a giant to save the world from King Bali.
I am Parashurama and
I was Lord Rama!
I am Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Shiva)!
And I am Saraswati, Kali
and Lakshmi, as well.
I am neither male nor female
nor a transgender.
I am neither the body
nor its parts.
I am knowledge, creation
reason and eternal.
I am everything!
Yet, I am nothing!
This has happened in every age
and will happen in future,
as well.
Kunti!
Arjun!
Yudhishthir, Bheem,
Nakul, Sahadev!
No!
No!
Mother
Bhagirath had brought you
to the earth from heaven
so that his subjects could
offer the ashes of their
beloved deceased in your waters
and pray for their salvation.
Have you ever seen
an unfortunate event
when a person came
to offer his own ashes?
Today, I am here, mother
to offer you my own ashes
and pray for my salvation.
These are my ashes, mother.
The way the skeletons
are the basis of a body
the sons of Pandu
were the basis of my life.
They were the basis
of all my hopes.
They were the basis of the
future of my kingdom's subjects.
The leaves of a tree
may fall off
but its roots can
never attain liberation.
You are the root of the
tree of righteousness, uncle.
How can you attain liberation?
The tree has fallen, Vidur.
Hastinapur's tree
of righteousness fell today.
It fell.
Every inch of me is burning
with anger and dejection.
I feel like following
Lord Parashuram's example
by drawing my weapons
and destroying the entire
Kuru dynasty!
I feel like punishing
Duryodhan and his brothers
in such a manner
that they repent
for their sins
till the end of time!
I feel like following
Lord Parashuram's example
and punishing Duryodhan
and his brothers
in such a manner
that they repent
for their sins
till the end of time!
But I...
But I cannot do so, Vidur.
I...
I am helpless.
Even if one's child is a sinner
one cannot kill it
with one's hands.
Now, my heart
hopes for nothing in this world.
My end must be near.
No, uncle!
I have faith
in your merits and in that
of my ancestors.
The tree of righteousness
can never fall.
But just for a little while
it has been clouded by
the mist of unrighteousness.
But when the time is right
that mist will certainly
clear up, uncle
and that tree will be
visible once again.
How?
How, Vidur?
How?
I had a suspicion, uncle
that Duryodhan and
the King of Gandhar, Shakuni
had hatched a conspiracy
in Varnavrat.
I had informed Yudhishthir
about the same, uncle.
Does this mean
that the sons of Pandu
are alive?
They must certainly be, uncle.
Rahu can swallow the sun
only for a few moments
but not forever.
They must certainly
be alive, uncle.
And when the time is right,
they will show themselves.
Arjun
we cannot look like
Princes any longer.
If the news of our survival
reaches Hastinapur
then a search party
will be sent for us.
Brother Yudhishthir
we should give up
our kingly clothes
and dress up as ascetics.
That's a sensible idea.
We will dress up
as 'Brahmins' and sages
and proceed to the West.
After travelling for a few days
we will reach the place
where father and mother Madri
have been commemorated.
The place where
our lives had begun.
Greetings, Minister.
Listen carefully.
Henceforth, you shall have
only one task.
You must monitor all activities
of the King of Anga, Karna
and inform the same to me.
Do remember.
Each sentence spoken
by the King of Anga, Karna
and every word uttered by him
should register in your mind
and you must
remember everything.
As you say.
Mother Radha.
Son.
Karna!
Son!
I
shall stay here tonight,
mother Radha.
I have forgotten the taste
of the food made by you.
I hope, you will
feed me yourself.
Son, you...
Why do you seem so agitated?
What is it, son?
T-Tell me, son!
Do not ask him anything, Radha.
Let him catch his breath first.
The major flaw of the
environment of a palace
is that it is serene
on the surface
but very soon, it ignites
a fire within one's heart.
An unrighteous person's heart
burns with the fire of desire
but that of a righteous person
burns with the fire of remorse.
Son! That place
is not right, son.
Please give up the greed
of being a King.
Come back, son.
Stay in your home with us.
That is not possible, mother.
I...
I cannot forsake my friend.
That is why, I had told you
that we would nourish this house
with righteousness, Radhe
because I knew
that you would have to be a part
of unrighteousness there.
If you befriend a serpent
it is bound to bite you.
Prince Duryodhan is not
a serpent, father!
Even he has met with injustice!
And even this is true
that resorting to righteousness
will not aid him
in having his right.
If you are certain
that Duryodhan's approach
is the only possible solution
then why are you
so unhappy, son?
Do not ask me that, father.
I have given my word
to Prince Duryodhan.
When the pillars of a temple
collapse, it causes no grief.
But when
the idol in the temple's
sanctuary breaks
it gives birth to
unrighteousness, father.
This is the fire
that burns me up.
Tell me how to put out
this fire, father.
Please tell me how to
put out this fire.
Charity.
Engage in charity, son
because charity is the
only form of meditation
that washes away all sins.
And also pray that
may Duryodhan's plan
never succeed
may your friend be saved
from committing sins
and may you be saved too.
Greetings, Crown Prince!
- Greetings.
Greetings, Her Highness!
- Bless you.
Do come in.
This place is outside the city
of Varnavrat, Purochan.
Indeed, Crown Prince.
I had the ambition of making
a grand palace for all of you.
And I could never have got
so much space within the city.
That is why, I had the palace
constructed here, Crown Prince.
Where?
Beneath the earth?
Why are you jesting,
Prince Bheem?
It is right there.
Let me show you.
Do come in, Her Highness.
Please enter.
Purochan, before we enter
we must light a lamp
at the entrance.
I-Indeed.
Certainly, Her Highness.
Do come in.
Do come in, Her Highness.
This way.
Do come in, Crown Prince.
This way.
Why bother, Her Highness?
Let me hold it.
Please enter.
This palace is miraculous,
Crown Prince.
My sons and I have
put a lot of labour
into constructing it.
We have poured all our knowledge
into building this palace.
Wonderful, Purochan.
Never have I seen
such a beautiful palace.
Does the entire palace get
illuminated with only moonlight?
Indeed, Crown Prince.
We have placed mirrors
in such a way here
that moonlight is
sufficient for lighting.
There is no need to light
even a single lamp.
Now, a more beautiful
structure than this
can be made only by Lord Vishwakarma.*
*Ultimate reality (later developed as Brahman), the "Principal Architect of the Universe".
Splendid!
Marvellous, Purochan.
Brother Yudhishthir
you should reward Purochan
for this lovely creation of his.
To have all of you reside
in the palace made by me
is more than a reward
to me, Prince Bheem.
On a new moon night
how does the palace
get illuminated?
On a new moon night
how does the palace
get illuminated?
A-Actually...
Actually...
- Sahadev
who is going to stay here
until the new moon?
Why do you worry unnecessarily?
Just think of how many mirrors
are present in this palace.
Nakul is going to be
very pleased.
Incidentally, the question
is a valid one, Purochan.
How does the palace get
illuminated on a new moon night?
We will have to
light torches then.
No, Crown Prince!
I will certainly think of a way
before the new moon night.
Brother, your room must
also be quite marvellous.
Let's have a look.
I will be there.
Let's go, mother.
I forgot to tell Purochan as to
where to put that lamp.
What happened, Purochan?
Pardon me, Her Highness.
I dropped the lamp.
That is
an ill omen, Purochan.
The person who drops a lamp
meets with misfortune.
Now, light the lamp again
and place it near the entrance.
As you say, Her Highness.
He said that the cornerstone
of a temple is its pillars
and the sanctity of the temple
lies in the idol situated
in the temple's sanctuary.
When the pillars
of a temple collapse
it causes no grief.
But when the idol in the
temple's sanctuary breaks
it gives birth
to unrighteousness.
Pillars are the cornerstone
of a temple...
Which temple was the
King of Anga talking about?
I could not
understand that, Minister
but the King of Anga
seemed exceedingly unhappy.
As though he was
experiencing hell itself.
Duryodhan's enemies are
certainly the Pandavas
but why would the King of Anga
compare them to the
pillars of a temple?
When the idol in the
temple's sanctuary breaks...
He...
He...
He was talking about
the Pandavas
mother, Her Highness?
Duryodhan must certainly be
planning to kill sister-in-law
and her sons in Varnavrat.
I must talk to uncle at once.
Greetings, aunt!
Bless you.
Greetings, Grand sire!
- Bless you, child.
Greetings, Minister!
Bless you, child.
Greetings, Sage Drona.
- Greetings.
[MUSIC]
Greetings, uncle.
Bless you, Krishna.
Greetings, Duryodhan.
Greetings, Krishna.
Welcome, Krishna.
I've arranged for your stay
and refreshments at my palace.
No, Duryodhan.
I am here with a peace treaty.
I am not here to stay.
I can't stay at your palace.
Don't you trust us, Krishna?
If trust is all you wanted
then you could've asked
for my advice
and not a treaty.
I shall stay
at Minister Vidhur's place.
See you at the court tomorrow.
Greetings, Krishna.
Greetings, Karna.
I am impressed
with your archery.
Like Lord Karthikeya* and Lord Ganesha
*Karthikeya, a war god, second son of Shiva and Parvathi, and the younger brother of Ganesha (the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom).
you and Parth
bring pride to the Arya clan.
If you both form a nexus
then the reign of righteousness
would prevail among the clan.
Karthikeya and Ganesh
would never stay
in Kailash together.
I hope you're aware of it.
Goddess Parvati
was unfortunate that way.
We are fortunate that we are
not siblings.
I shall fight a battle
with Arjun.
Doesn't this peace treaty
make you happy?
Why do I need to wage
a war to combat Arjun?
I can call him
for a war anytime.
Thwarting such a catastrophe
would be the right thing to do.
I congratulate you.
I can see that you
advocate righteousness.
Why do you emphasize
on warfare then?
Krishna, let's go.
Rashavi, is that all?
What about the sweet meat?
Apologies, Krishna!
After the warfare meeting
we've been eating
such plain food.
Bitter leaves for the bitterness
that's spread around Hastinapur.
Dry bread for the dryness
that's spread around.
I wanted to make sweets for you
but sister stopped me.
Why so, aunt?
I love sweets.
Krishna!
I can almost see
Kuru Dynasty ruin.
On one hand I think
such a warfare must be avoided.
On the other hand I feel
that justice
shouldn't be denied
at any cost.
Keeping calm
under these circumstances
is impossible, Krishna.
One needs to feel
happiness, aunt.
It can never be attained.
One who seeks happiness
out of materialism
seldom attains happiness.
One whose happiness
lies in power and wealth
invites ruin for himself.
Kuru Dynasty
is destined to be ruined.
King Dhritarashtra
never understood
what true happiness is.
His sons too
sought happiness
in power, wealth
and satiating their arrogance.
Will the entire dynasty
be doomed?
Can't you save anyone?
Of course they will be saved.
Justice and righteousness
shall prevail.
Elements that have to be
destroyed will be destroyed.
Ones that have to be saved
shall remain safe.
That's why I said
that happiness
needs to be understood
and it can't be attained.
Here!
Let me relish the sweets
that you've prepared.
Tomorrow at the court
everyone will be rewarded
according to their perspective.
Greetings, Your Highness.
Bless you, Krishna.
I welcome...
The mightiest Yadava
on the land of Hastinapur.
Krishna
the Kuru Dynasty is on
the threshold of ruin.
Like one realises darkness
when night befalls
I can sense Kuru Dynasty's doom
when I see my elders anxious.
Vasudev
only you can show us the way
to stop this battle.
Please, show us a way.
Long live the King!
Your Highness
return the Pandavas
kingdom to them
and make your sons ready
for repentance and punishment.
I promise you that they
will not lose their lives.
But they will have to let go
of their pride.
If this is acceptable to you
then the battle
can be averted.
Vasudev!
I am the rightful ruler
of Indraprastha
the King isn't.
Under no circumstances
will I return Indraprastha.
And as long as the Pandavas
aren't the rulers
of Indraprastha
they have no right
to battle anyone, Vasudev.
Everyone has the right
to fight against injustice
Prince.
It's the Pandavas' generosity
that they haven't started
a battle with you so far.
They respected the King
at every step.
Actually
the end of a state
is ensured
by its very beginning.
A margosa tree
never yields mangoes.
Your Highness
even this battle
began the very day
that King Pandu died
in that forest
and his sons arrived
at Hastinapur.
Had you announced
Prince Yudhishthir
to be the Crown Prince
that very day
then this circumstance
wouldn't have arisen.
But you were unable to overcome
your attachment
towards the royal throne.
What kind
of language
are you using,
Vasudev?
Have you come
to propose peace
or to declare a battle?
King of Gandhar
only he who benefits from lies
considers the truth an insult.
But the truth is that,
Vasudev...
That only the king's son
becomes the next king.
But you are a temporary king.
The truth is
that your coronation
never took place.
So, how do your sons
have any right to the throne?
What is the point of digging up
the past
Your Highness?
Vasudev
the truth is that at the end
of the game of dice
the Pandavas had accepted
that they will live in
anonymity for one year.
But before the completion
of that one year, Duryodhan
had found Arjun.
We are ready to free
the Pandavas from their exile.
Only if they give up
the idea of a battle.
Even sinning in the courtyard
of a temple
does not convert the sin
into a good deed
King of Gandhar.
That very game of dice
was unlawful.
So, its results are meaningless.
Vasudev
did brother Yudhishthir
not stake his property
his brothers, his wife
and himself, voluntarily?
So, how could it
be unlawful, Vasudev?
By trying to disrobe
a woman at this court
you had turned the whole
proceeding unlawful, Prince.
No one asks which morsel
has poisoned the body.
The whole food is considered
poisonous.
Even I was unarmed
at the court of Indraprastha.
Have you forgotten that,
Vasudev?
When you were unarmed
at that court
why did you not declare
war right then, Prince?
Why did you conspire
to disrobe a woman
at the court,
during the game of dice?
The truth is
that you are incapable
of battling them.
Vasudev, even
His Excellency Bhishma
was present at the game of dice
along with Guru Drona.
Did they sin as well?
Yes, they did.
When the whole house
is crumbling
the gatekeepers cannot
just protect the door
King of Gandhar.
When someone is committing
a crime against society
against humanity
just protecting your own duty
results in a disaster.
I cannot support
this strange
sense of duty.
This is not the time
to have this debate.
Right now, we must
concentrate on trying to avert
this great battle.
And that's why, I have come
as a messenger of peace.
This message
is not acceptable to me.
If you leave this court now, Prince...
I will meet him next
only on the battle field
Your Highness.
Duryodhan.
Wait.
Vasudev
by talking of punishment
you made the message of peace
unacceptable.
How can any warrior
accept punishment?
Which warrior tries to disrobe
a woman from his own family
at the royal court,
Your Highness?
What does fearing punishment
after committing a crime, mean?
But still
I promise you
that if the culprits
touch Draupadi's feet
and ask for forgiveness
then they Pandavas will treat it
as a punishment.
What has happened to you, sister?
Sister!
Please get up!
Sanjay, now nobody can
stop my son's victory dance.
How much longer to sunset, Sanjay?
Not too long to go,
Your Highness!
This duration of time
will serve as a jolt
to the Pandavas!
Sanjay, Shikhandi's death
is now certain.
It is certain.
My Queen, her heartbeats seems
to have stopped.
I don't think she can survive now.
If Grandsire Bhishma does not die today
we will surely lose this war.
You will have to rise again.
You will have to go to the battlefield.
Rise!
Sister, you must.
Madhav, there is very
little time left for sunset.
Where is Shikhandi?
Arjuna, do not worry about Shikhandi.
He will only cause Grandsire
to lay down his weapons.
You will have to take the
fight to him thereafter.
To bring that great man down
all five of you brothers
will need to work together.
Master, do allow your student
to showcase his skills!
You are sure to die by my hands.
This is sure to happen today.
Charioteer, the Pandavas
are approaching him.
- Take me there.
- Stop right there, Duryodhan!
Do not worry about Grandsire!
Duryodhan, you should be
more concerned about yourself.
Lord Surya!
When Vichitravirya had died
I had called out to you.
Today, I request you.
Please wait a while longer.
After many years,
the possibility of my death
looks possible and near.
Please
let this happen.
May God bless all of you,
my dear.
The sunset is upon us.
Do not wait any longer for
Princess Amba.
Use all your combined powers
and attack me together.
Prince Bhima.
Take your mace and step down from chariot.
We are short on time.
If all five of you attack me together
you will surely be able to kill me.
Do not wait for Princess Amba.
Attack me, dear.
No, Grandsire.
How can all of us attack you together?
If four of my beloved ones lift
my bier during my last moments
and one of you takes the
fire to light the bier
I will consider myself extremely fortunate.
It is time for my departure.
Nakula, Sahadeva, get your weapons.
You have taught us the path of 
righteousness, Grandsire.
We cannot do this to you.
I saw the true face of righteousness yesterday.
For the first time ever.
After taking a lesson in
righteousness from Lord Kishna.
I order you...
to attack me together
as that is appropriate.
Do not shed tears.
You are about to bring
salvation upon me.
Arjuna.
Your powers...
don't need Amba's support.
Your powers will inspire millions
of others in times to come.
Take your weapons and attack me.
Dear, your weapons will
not cause me pain.
Instead I will be relieved!
Attack me!
Attack me!
Why are you standing silent?
Attack me!
Attack me!
My child, go and kill Shikhandi.
Hurry up!
Until we live, we will not allow
them to harm you.
Now, it is our responsibility 
to take you to Grandsire.
Attack me, Bhima.
Attack me, Bhima!
I command you!
Attack me, Bhima.
Attack me, Bhima.
Brilliant, Bhima!
You are an excellent mace fighter!
Sahadev, slay me!
Slay me!
These hands have comitted 
many sins!
My silence has caused much 
injustice in this lifetime!
This life of mine must ends!
This life should ends.
At the hands of you five,
my lads.
Yudhisthir, my lad.
Fight!
Fight!
Fight with all your might, my lad!
Do not wait for Shikhandi, my lad!
The sun is about to set. 
Attack me!
When your soul is plagued by age and exhaustion, 
I shall arrive as your death!
Your wait has come to an end, 
Grandsire Bheeshma!
Your redemption stands 
right before you!
Complete your life's purpose, 
Lady Amba!
The cause of your death is present 
before you, Bheeshma!
Recall your promise!
I make a promise...
I shall lay down all my weapons 
before you.
Grant me redemption, Lady Amba!
Stop decorating this 'mandap.'*
*A mandapa is a pillared outdoor hall or pavilion for public rituals.
Dhrishtadyum go tell the domestic help
that no marriage
will take place here.
Let's go, daughter.
Father, Draupadi...
Sister, he was Prince Arjun.
Those five brothers were
the sons of Pandu.
But they have decided
to stay hidden.
That is why,
I cannot tell father about it.
Please do not tell him either,
sister.
Please do not tell him.
Whoever they were, Draupadi...
After what they did
you have no right to think
of their well-being.
Let's go, Draupadi.
One can preach righteousness but
not order its implementation.
Each one of us must determine
what righteousness means to us.
I can only aid all of you
in familiarizing
yourselves with righteousness.
Yudhishthir
if you resort to asceticism
then a powerful kingdom
like Hastinapur
will be devoid of a worthy King.
My sons have renounced the
kingdom on their own, My Lord.
We do not covet the throne.
This must have been your
decision, Kunti.
But while taking this decision
did you think even once
about the welfare
of the subjects?
Did it ever occur to you
that if Duryodhan becomes King
then for generations to come
a great and powerful
kingdom like Hastinapur
will be ruled by selfishness
and unrighteousness?
No, sire.
My heart said that
nipping struggle in the bud
would be appropriate.
Letting your heart
rule your thoughts
and letting your head
govern your likes
is the first stage
of unrighteousness.
What do you feel about
this now, Kunti?
We must stop hiding like this
and return to Hastinapur.
After brother-in-law
descends from the throne
Yudhishthir must become
the next King.
Not for his personal gain
but to provide the subjects
with a worthy King.
Splendid.
Splendid!
But Yudhishthir and Bheem...
If both of them
resort to asceticism
then Duryodhan will
certainly be the next King
because Arjun is younger to him.
He has no right to the throne.
And on the other hand
if, apart from Yudhishthir
the remaining brothers
resort to asceticism
then who will protect
Yudhishthir?
Pardon me, My Lord
but is it necessary to discuss
politics at the moment?
It is unnecessary!
Pardon me, My Lord
but why is the decision
of marriage
being weighed on
the scales of politics?
That too when
it is such a dreadful situation
for Princess Draupadi.
Politics is also a method
of ensuring social welfare.
And it is as vital
as righteousness.
When facing a dreadful situation
if one forgets to think
of social welfare
and thinks only of himself
then is it correct?
Answer me.
No.
But My Lord...
Whenever the thought
of Princess Draupadi
comes into my mind
I fail to console myself,
oh revered one.
Becoming the wife to five men...
How can it be easy?
How can we make a woman
lead such a life?
Draupadi's life
will indeed be difficult...
Then can you five brothers
not make certain sacrifices?
Can you not take certain
difficult decisions
which will ease Draupadi's life?
If the decision to make
such a big sacrifice
was taken by Draupadi herself
then why are all of you
declining it?
Are you afraid of something?
Or does it involve
a selfish motive?
But My Lord, subjects follow
in the King's footsteps.
This will become a tradition.
Many women will be
forced to do so.
Would it be correct?
It would indeed
be incorrect, Prince
but at the moment
a major trouble
surrounds all of you.
The righteousness one resorts to
in times of trouble
can be referred to as
a duty in face of peril.
According to this
many such deeds are committed
which, under
normal circumstances
would be a grave sin.
If another woman will be married
to more than one man
then all those men will be
fated to a life in hell.
But for all of you,
this is not a typical situation.
Then its solution
may also be atypical.
What kind of a path
is this, My Lord?
How can the wife
of my younger brother
be deemed my own?
Instead of revering
the wife of my elder brother
as my own mother
how can I deem her
my wife, My Lord?!
How?
An urn is placed
between three pillars
and the Almighty's idol
is placed below the urn.
The idol is secure
from all five directions.
To whom is that idol
connected, Bheem?
To all of them
yet to none.
Similarly
can you not deem Draupadi
the idol in your life?
Do remember, Bheem.
The temple's idol sanctifies
the urn and the pillars.
The urn and the pillars
do not sanctify the idol.
What is your decision now,
sons of Pandu?
If you resort to asceticism
then a powerful kingdom
like Hastinapur
will be devoid
of a worthy King.
If Duryodhan becomes King
then for generations to come
a great and powerful
kingdom like Hastinapur
will be ruled by selfishness
and unrighteousness.
Then can you five brothers
not make certain sacrifices?
Can you not take
certain difficult decisions
which will ease
Draupadi's life?
Can you not deem Draupadi
the idol in your life?
After brother-in-law
descends from the throne
Yudhishthir must become
the next King.
Not for his personal gain
but to provide the subjects
with a worthy King.
If you resort to asceticism...
- After brother-in-law
descends from the throne...
- Who will protect Yudhishthir?
Yudhishthir must become
the next King.
Not for his personal gain...
- If Duryodhan becomes King
then for generations to come
a great and powerful
kingdom like Hastinapur
will be ruled by selfishness
and unrighteousness.
Not for his personal gain
but to provide the subjects
with a worthy King.
We must go to Kampilya
and bear the cloak
of asceticism
called life, sage.
And this will establish
righteousness.
Go on, sons of Pandu.
Bless you!
Dhrishtadyumna!
What is your order, father?
Those five 'Brahmins
are approaching
who have had the nerve to
insult the Princess of Panchal.
Get the troops ready!
Soldiers!
The way throwing away
rotten food
does not result
in committing a sin!
Similarly
killing 'Brahmins
indulged in unrighteousness
does not result
in committing a sin!
It helps one earn merits!
Today
by killing the five 'Brahmins
approaching Kampilya
all of you
shall be recipients of merit!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!
How dare you come here?
Who gave you the right
to enter Kampilya?!
After insulting
my daughter so gravely
forget about Kampilya...
None of you will find a place to
stay in the entire Aryan region!
King Drupad.
These five 'Brahmins
are none
but the Princes of Hastinapur
the sons of King Pandu.
And that is Arjun
to whom you had dreamt
of having your daughter married.
Grandsire will not fight us
in the battlefield.
He knows what his duties are.
But his duty is to serve
the throne of Hastinapur.
Are his principles
more important to him
than serving the throne?
One does not forsake one's
principles for the throne, dear.
Give the sons of Pandu
what is rightfully theirs.
In order to wring clothes
one can apply force
only up to a limit.
One does not apply
excessive force, dear.
You have hurt
the Pandavas enough.
Now, returning their property
with due respect
is the righteous thing to do.
Do not let the patience
of the sons of Pandu cave in
dear Duryodhan.
Arjun has challenged us
to a battle.
Return them their property
and also the throne
of Yudhishthir.
I shall make them agree
to accept the property.
Give them
what is rightfully theirs.
They will never refuse
to what I say.
Are you asking for mercy for
the Pandavas, Your Excellency?
If you are making a request
then we shall return
the Pandavas their property.
However
mercy cannot aid one
get the throne, can it
Minister?
If you are asking
for their rights
then do pardon us,
Your Excellency.
We cannot give them
their rights.
The sons of Pandu are capable
of taking their rights,
King of Gandhar.
The land they attack
with wrath and vengeance
will have to face
utter destruction.
Dear Dhritarashtra
take the correct decision.
End this struggle.
A struggle always has
two sides, uncle.
You must convince the Pandavas
to prove that it was
sundown the other day.
Their rights shall be returned
to them with due respect then.
However,
if they attack us
then we cannot
stay quiet either.
Go and tell the Pandavas
that the right
to attack a kingdom
resides only with another King
and not with forest dwellers.
All hail Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail Emperor Yudhishthir!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
All hail Empress Draupadi!
All hail Ballav Maharaj!
Because you gave us refuge
your kingdom was attacked,
Your Highness.
Emperor Yudhishthir
when a piece of gold is shaped,
it transforms into an ornament.
By spending your life
of anonymity in my kingdom
you have sanctified
my entire household.
The army of the Matsya kingdom
is prepared.
The moment you give the order
we shall attack Hastinapur.
You have indebted us
with your love, Your Highness.
A twig within a whirlwind with
the intent of touching the sky
has no competence of its own.
No
the armies will not fight,
Your Highness.
We five brothers took an oath
solely based upon our competence
and we shall use it
to fulfill our vows.
Very soon,
only five chariots
will be standing
at the gates of Hastinapur.
To punish the hundred
sons of King Dhritarashtra!
Not hundred,
Panchali.
Hundred and one,
Panchali.
Have a message
sent to Hastinapur.
The basis of unrighteousness
of Crown Prince Duryodhan
is the competence
of King Karna of Anga.
The sons of Pandu will sacrifice
hundred and one people.
The way
hundred and one fruits
of the Golden Apple Tree
are offered to Lord Shiva
for worship
similarly
tomorrow at dawn
hundred and one severed heads
will be presented to
the Deity of the Battlefield
Kala Bhairav* as an offering.
*The fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.
Tomorrow at dawn,
hundred and one severed heads
will be presented to
the Deity of the Battlefield
Kala Bhairav as an offering.
How dare the sons of Pandu
challenge me to a battle?!
I shall render
the people sleepless
who dream of beheading me.
Forever!
Forever.
By accepting the heads
of the Pandavas, Kala Bhairav
will have to be contented,
friend.
Anyone who attacks you
shall be slain by me.
Have faith in my competence.
Why are you getting so excited,
King Karna of Anga?
The right to fight
on behalf of Hastinapur
has not been given to you yet
because
the other term for 'rights
is 'responsibilities.
With the grace of the Almighty
this right
resides with the most competent
person of this world
and the most powerful General
His Excellency Bhishma.
Impossible!
The challenge is for the hundred
sons of Dhritarashtra
and not Hastinapur!
Challenge?
Challenge...
This is not a challenge,
Your Excellency Bhishma.
This is a protest.
A protest of slaves!
Do something,
Your Excellency.
Do something.
Whether the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas
was successful or not
has not yet been proved by them
in any manner.
That day,
the sunlight
had not faded,
grandsire.
Even when the sun goes down
and the sunlight is visible
it is still called
dusk,
grandsire
and not night.
When one cannot see the sun
while standing
in a particular place
it is deemed
the end of the day
for that particular place.
Now,
this question
is of righteousness,
Your Excellency Bhishma.
Who is the one
who gets to decide
whether it was night
or day,
Your Excellency?
You?
Yudhishthir?
Me?
Who?
In other words
their challenge and attack
are both acts
of unrighteousness.
Now, you must decide,
Your Excellency Bhishma
whether you
wish to take the side
of righteous people
or that
of that family.
You must leave
bearing righteousness within you
and weapons in your arms
My Lords.
Righteousness is on your side.
Become the weapons
of the Almighty
to slay the sinners!
Uncle, tomorrow at dawn,
the sons of Pandu
will enter Hastinapur.
When Hastinapur will echo
with the sound of a battle cry
we will have to hoist either
of the flags, uncle.
The white flag of peace
or the red flag of war.
Hastinapur has emerged
victorious
for the past
seven generations, uncle.
If the sons of Pandu win
then the honour of Hastinapur
will get annihilated.
However,
if the sons of Pandu lose
then the entire Aryan region
will be robbed of righteousness.
I have taken an oath to protect
the throne of Hastinapur
Vidur.
If the sons of Pandu
lose then my dream will break.
Either way,
I end up being defeated.
Only the sons of Pandu
can safeguard my principles.
However, my principles
cannot safeguard
the sons of Pandu.
Till this old man
continues to stand
in front of the Pandavas
the Pandavas are bound
to be defeated.
Are you here
to fight a battle, son?
In reply
even I have waived
off the red flag.
I am the actual stronghold
of Hastinapur.
If you're competent enough
then try breaking
this bastion.
Lift your weapons,
Pandavas.
In reply of your summon
Hastinapur's defender
is present here before you.
No, grandsire.
I cannot shoot an arrow at you.
- Then accept defeat, Arjun
and return.
I am confined
to the throne of Hastinapur.
If Hastinapur is ever attacked
I will definitely be present
to defend it.
You too raise your weapons.
If Hastinapur is ever attacked
I will definitely be present
do defend it.
You too raise your weapons.
The summon was
for the Kauravas
and not the entire
Hastinapur, grandsire.
There are not courageous enough
to even accept this!
Then based on what powers
did they commit a crime.
Based on my powers,
Bhima.
My powers.
It's very unfortunate
for me
that my righteousness
serves as a shield
to many unrighteous deeds.
We're not here to fight
a battle with you, grandsire.
Hence we sent the summon
only to King
Dhritarashtra's sons
and the king of Anga,
Karna.
Your summon
for a battle
has not been accepted
by Dhritarashtra's sons.
If they do not come
to fight a battle with you
then what will you do?
We will be forced
to break the fort
and that will be considered
an attack on Hastinapur.
Guru Drona and you will
raise your weapons against us
and we will have
to fight you.
This means, grandsire,
that the circumstances are
that either we forget about
our humiliation
forget about our wealth
and reside in the forests.
Or we attack you.
Why this dilemma?
Why this dilemma, grandsire?
You very well know,
grandsire
that we're on the side
of righteousness.
The cruel behaviour that
Kauravas showed towards us
towards your daughter-in-law...
Is it not important
to punish them?
Why are you protecting them?
I have no remedy, son.
The outer cover
of the coconut
cannot sacrifice his stiffness.
Even if the water within
the coconut dries
not even then.
I will have to carry out
my duties.
A person who was born blind
won't let be
Gandhari's husband, father!
Never!
Gandhari?
Gandhari, stop!
Gandhari!
It means...
It means, my dear sister
has been kept in the dark!
Firmness and callousness
have a very thin line
of difference, father.
But the difference itself,
runs quite deep.
A father is firm
and callous is but an enemy.
An enemy.
No, Gandhari.
No.
It's not the time to
shed tears, Gandhari.
It's not the time to cry.
I am still alive.
Your brother!
I will not let anything happen
that may cause grief to you.
It's my oath.
I am not scared
of Hastinapur.
They may have power.
They may have abundant wealth.
But you and your future
are not within their rights
to trample upon.
No rights at all!
Why did father do this?
Why didn't he inform that my
husband was born blind?
I wouldn't have at least
dreamt so big.
Gandhari, he isn't
your husband yet.
He isn't your husband.
The imbecile heart dreams
beyond limits, brother.
I had dreamt about my future.
The future shattered in no time.
Dreams are like
a bottle filled with fireflies.
Once it breaks,
all lustre is lost.
The shattered glass pierces
and bleeds the heart.
I am hurt
for father should have
at least told me.
Gandhari.
I will immediately send a
message to Hastinapur
that we do not accept
the wedding proposal.
They can attack if they wish to
but we do not accept
the wedding proposal.
We do not accept it.
Brother.
Didn't father have at least
that much faith in me?
Wasn't he confident of
the values he taught me?
Gandhari
what are you saying?
Brother, father has
pampered me very much.
Parents can never ask for
compensation of their love.
Cession in lieu of love can't be
forsaken by an offspring either.
When my parents are in a dilemma
I cannot refuse from
sacrificing, brother.
Father didn't have faith in me
and this bothers me.
But being a princess
I accept his decision.
But
with a man who
was born blind...
How would you be happy
with him, Gandhari?
How would you?
If I don't find happiness
then it's apt to consider
what's found to be bliss.
The happiness of the subjects
should be more important.
These are the values
taught by my parents.
As a son has rights
on his father's wealth
a daughter has rights on his
values, doesn't she?
This marriage
is acceptable to me.
But, Gandhari...
Brother, get ready
to proceed to Hastinapur.
Princess
why are you putting
out the lamps?
I am trying to get
used to darkness.
But, princess, aren't you
scared of darkness?
I am...
I am really scared of darkness.
But darkness is going to
be a part of my life.
I have to fight my fears.
Princess, you are
marrying a blind man
and not darkness.
To understand one
with dark cast over his eyes
one has to understand
the darkness, Sugadha.
How would have the prince
lived in darkness all his life?
When we stumble while walking
we are careful of
not stumbling again.
But
the prince may have
stumbled several times.
The fear of darkness must
have hounded him too.
Princess, I have no answers
to your questions.
But I have to find the
answers to all these questions.
Hereafter, I have to
stop depending on light.
I have to befriend darkness.
In this very darkness,
my married life
and steps to its success
will be visible to me.
Go, Sugadha.
Sugadha, leave!
All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!
All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!
All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!
All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!
Dhritarashtra.
- Mother.
Greetings, mother.
- May you live long, son.
Mother, I... - I had seen
Gandhari yesterday.
The guest house used by
king of Gandhar and his family
she was seated there
at the porch.
She is really beautiful.
Here, wear this.
Mother, another piece
of ornament?
That isn't an ornament
it's a talisman.
Let's go.
The Queen Mother is eager to
take you to the wedding tent.
Let's proceed.
Where is Pandu?
I am here, mother.
Pandu, I can't see myself.
You should tell me,
how do I look?
Today is my first
meeting with Gandhari.
Your valour is known
all over Gandhar.
Your image in the eyes
of the princess
has already been discerned
before your meeting.
Let's go.
The auspicious time for
the wedding is nearing. - Sure.
Greetings, Queen Mother. - You
should go to the guest house
and give a message to
the king of Gandhar
to immediately come
along with Gandhari.
The auspicious time for
the wedding is here.
Queen Mother, their messenger
has brought a message
that princess Gandhari
is being adorned.
They will all start for here
in the next two half hours.
Sugadha, are you done
with the adornment?
Yes, princess.
All of you should now
wait outside my room.
Leave me alone for some time.
But, princess, it's time
for the wedding.
Let the future wait for me.
I want to be alone
for some time.
Leave, Sugadha.
Govind!
Draupadi.
Draupadi!
Don't touch me,
Queen Mother Kunti.
I'll get besmirched.
I'm no longer
your daughter-in-law.
I'm not your sons' wife.
Neither am I the bride
of the Kuru dynasty.
Dear!
Now, I'm without a husband
a name
or a dynasty.
Just like a flame
burning in the hearth
of a forest dweller far away.
I am pure
but I am thriving
on what is impure.
Today, in this court
I alone have shed tears
equivalent to that of all
the women in this world.
Queen Mother Kunti
Queen Gandhari
if you wish to save yourselves
then renounce
this court and leave.
Because this whole court
will drown today.
I'm not a human being
but death!
Only death!
I'm the death
of all the wicked men
present
in this unrighteous court.
And it's my curse
that right now,
at this very moment...
No, Draupadi!
Please don't curse,
Draupadi.
Forgive them.
Please forgive them.
My curse is forgiveness
in itself, Your Highness.
If I have to punish
then it shall be
in this lifetime.
Every moment,
they'll experience hell.
There will be no end
to their suffering.
No.
The woman who gives life
can't give death.
These men have almost
committed suicide in this court.
If someone destroys
their physical being
it is called self-annihilation.
But suicide takes place
when they destroy their souls.
Out of rage
don't do something
similar to these men.
It's a woman's task
to keep the house clean.
And it's a woman's task as well
to keep the society clean.
I curse that...
- Stop, Panchali.
Today, the sons of Pandu
have endured
a great disgrace, Panchali.
Give us a chance
to redeem ourselves.
Let us avenge your dishonour.
How will you take revenge?
You are now the slaves
of these wicked people.
And I no longer
consider you my husband.
Henceforth
I shall never bind my hair.
I shall not wear a tiara
on my head!
Henceforth
I will never tie my hair.
I will not adorn
my forehead with any ornaments.
I accept it.
But only you...
Only you can guard
our souls, Draupadi.
If you don't give us
a chance
to repent for our sins
then till the end of time
we will reside
in the netherworld, Draupadi.
I'm not saying this
as a husband
but as a friend.
Don't lose your patience,
Draupadi.
Don't lose your patience.
Sometimes the deeds
of others terrify us
and give us a chance
to lose our patience.
But continue
to be patient.
It is very important
to control one's heart.
Patience?
Patience!
Patience...
My dear...
That's enough, my dear.
King Dhritarashtra
your younger brother,
Pandu's family
has once again done
you a favour.
Go and live happily!
But until you're leading
a content life
keep in mind
that the day my sons...
The day my sons
attain freedom
will be the last day
of your happiness.
Your sons will
attain freedom?
Keep quiet, my dear.
Keep quiet.
Let him speak, Shakuni.
This is his arrogance speaking!
You wanted to disrobe Draupadi,
isn't it, Duryodhan?
Look!
Look around this court!
Even the skin of a poisonous
snake
deserts it.
All those who quietly
witnessed this unrighteous act...
Look at how they have been
disrobed
like a snake!
Look around this court!
Listen carefully, Duryodhan
I will soon go to Dwarka
and bring Krishna's
Narayani army to Hastinapur.
And I will request
Krishna and Balrama
to defeat
the Kuru dynasty!
Help my sons gain freedom!
But not to kill any of you
because the responsibility
of taking revenge
for my daughter-in-law's
humiliation
lies only with my sons.
And this task
will be done
only by my sons.
No, Kunti.
No.
No, Kunti.
Don't give us such
a severe punishment.
If the Kuru dynasty is
destroyed
at my hands
then the souls of my ancestors
will never rest in peace.
No.
I seek your forgiveness
Draupadi.
You can ask for any wish
you want.
Yes.
But forgive my sons.
If it's possible for you
erase the memories
of today's game.
Nothing else
can subside my pain.
The stain on our characters
will never be erased, my dear.
But so that our sadness
decreases to some extent
ask for a wish, my dear.
Do His Highness a favour.
Ask for a wish.
Ask, my dear.
Give the Pandavas
their freedom.
Return their weapons.
Their powers had been
snatched through treachery
in this court.
Return their powers to them.
Make an announcement
in the entire Kuru kingdom
that King Pandu has won
Kunti's hand in the 'swayamvar'.
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
Prince, I have
brought you your meal.
Okay.
Set it down.
The taste...
It's a bit different today.
It has been prepared in the
Gandhar's culinary style, sire.
Gandhari wished
you to be introduced to
the taste of Gandhar's cuisine.
She herself...
- If you didn't like it
I will get another meal
ready in no time.
No!
The taste of
Gandhar's cuisine is good.
It's different but it's good.
Won't you take a seat?
So finally the dishes of
Gandhar did make
their way into Hastinapur's
royal kitchen.
It's my first try, Prince.
I must say,
it's quite a good one.
But it won't be famous
in Hastinapur.
Henceforth
the procedures of
Kunti province will be followed.
If the platter has a variety
of tastes
the joy of having food
increases, Prince.
If the tastes of here, Gandhar
and Kunti province join
what harm can it pose?
Don't try to preach to me!
You don't have the right
to offer me counsel.
I'm just trying to ease your
agitated heart, Prince.
I understand that you
are still disturbed.
But, Prince, the pillar
of a temple is as pious
as the stoup it holds.
As a matter of fact, the stoup
can't be without a pillar.
The one who was born
to be considered the'stoup
could never be
the supporting 'pillar'.
And the 'pillar' meant
for support
wouldn't suit if it were
glorified to be the'stoup'.
Which stone has been
made for either of them
is something only the architect
knows best about.
We should accept the decision
of the Almighty, Prince.
This is the time to forego
of all bitterness
and welcome Pandu and Kunti.
- Don't touch me!
I haven't yet given you
the right to do so!
Every time...
Every time I try to
consider you as my wife
this very behaviour of yours
makes me feel
as to how much
my insult...
Gladdens you.
How very much are
you at peace by the same!
Remember, Gandhari
Pandu's welcome
will neither be done by me
nor by you.
I am your husband.
My orders define your
rules of conduct.
Now whether you abide by
the same or not
is a choice I leave to you.
Two persons
on coming closer
try to form boundaries and rules
for the other for sure.
If we ponder over every
relationship, we'd notice
that the source of all of them
are the very boundaries
that we draw for others.
And even if unknowingly,
a stranger oversteps the bounds
the very instant
our heart palpitates with anger.
What's the actual form of
these boundaries?
Have we ever given
it a thought?
By imposing boundaries
we don't allow the other
to decide for himself.
We impose our decision
on the other.
In other words, we reject
the independence of another.
And when independence
is rejected, his heart
is filled with sorrow.
And when he breaks
all the boundaries
our heart is filled with wrath.
Isn't that how it always
happens?
But if everyone respects
the independence of another
boundaries and rules
become extinct.
In other words
just like agreement is
the body of a relationship
isn't independence the soul
of a relationship?
Think over it.
No, dear.
Son-in-law
the first to be offered respect
is the King of the Yadavas
Shoorsen.
He is the one who
sired Kunti.
No!
Greater than the father
is the one who
brings up the child.
You are so right, sire.
The one who forsook one's
child after its birth
can never be the first
to be offered respect.
Your right will always
come second.
You may please proceed.
Please come.
Did you hear that, Priyamvada?
So generous and broad
is the outlook of my husband!
By selecting such a husband
I have made myself fortunate!
- Yes, Princess.
But now you must do
no such thing
that robs you of your fortune.
But I can't deceive my husband.
If in order to gain something
one has to lie
that's deception
but in order to shield oneself
from harm, if truth is concealed
it's not termed
a deception, Princess.
Don't try to weave
a web of words, Priyamvada.
The truths of the world
are but hazy at best
to palace dwellers
but do remember
that if the same truths
pass into the hands of a foe
they become but
trebuchets.
What...
What are you doing?
This is a shield, Princess.
To safeguard your
and King Pandu's happy life
from the attacks
of any vile person.
Till the time this thread
is tied around your wrist
you won't say a thing
about your past to your husband.
What are you doing?
- This is a shield, Princess.
To safeguard your
and King Pandu's happy life
from the attacks
of any vile person.
Till the time this thread
is tied around your wrist
you won't say a thing
about your past to your husband.
But... - There's no time
for options, Princess.
A king has many wives.
If King Pandu marries
a second time
this very secret of yours
will become a risk to your life.
And anyway
a secret portends
a danger to a woman.
Why...
Why do I get the feeling
that by tying this thread
you have but curtailed
my breaths.
If I keep this matter
a secret from my husband
then it would be
my second crime.
Moreover
after having forsaken my son
I have committed a crime.
God knows
who would have raised my son.
Whose family would have
served as his refuge.
Would he...
Would he have ever received
maternal love?
Or just as an orphan
is he destined to
suffer pangs of sorrow.
Where could my son be?
Where could be...
My Karna!
Help!
Someone, help me!
Hey! Look! Move away!
- Help!
What's going on?
- Help!
Run for your lives!
- Someone save him!
Someone save him!
Save him!
Move back!
Move back!
- Step back! - Save him!
What's going on!
Someone save him!
Move!
Son!
Karna!
Yes?
Radha, your son
is indeed divine.
Mother, I just...
Mother?
Mother!
Mother!
- Shut up, idiot!
First you infuriate me
and then chant my name!
Come home and I'll
take you to task!
But why, mother?
What did I do?
I was just saving the kid.
And what about you?
Would the Lord save you?
Why don't you think before
doing anything?
But I don't require
any protection, mother.
You know that already.
- Shut up and come home!
Come on!
Come home and I'll
take you to task!
Come on home!
Mother!
Are you angry, mother?
Son, you first infuriate me
and then very coyly ask
if I am angry.
Why do you do any such deed
that makes me angry?
I'm Adhirath's son.
I will have to save
the child, right?
I know that.
But I have to save you from
your father's temper, right?
And after the deed you've
done today
deems your punishment necessary.
Father had gone to the Kunti
province with the King, right?
But now he's
on his way back.
Son, the King is coming
back with his Queen
and we have to pay them a visit.
Does that mean they will
actually see us?
But why would they see us, son?
Neither are we any criminal
nor any valorous warrior.
Mother, haven't you
always said that
being graced with the King's
attention is good fortune?
Or even great misfortune.
Son, attention from
great people
always has a profound effect.
Then we should be graced
with Their Highness' attention.
But how?
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
This is a shield, Princess.
To safeguard your
and King Pandu's happy life
from the attacks
of any vile person.
Till the time this thread
is tied around your wrist
you won't say a thing about
your past to your husband.
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
All hail!
- King Pandu!
Why did you stop, Adhirath?
The Chief Minister is coming
to welcome you, Your Highness.
Greetings!
- Greetings, younger brother!
Greetings!
- Greetings!
His and Her Highness
are welcome.
Your Highness, Mother Queen
has ordered
that you should first pay
a visit to the district deity.
Won't you welcome your brother
and sister-in-law, Vidur?
I would welcome
sister-in-law
by being her charioteer.
Adhirath, if you may,
please proceed to your home.
Please take some rest.
My lord!
My lord!
Radha, how are you?
Where is Karna?
He is busy preparing for
the King and Queen's welcome
so that Their Highness
be pleased.
What are you saying?
Why didn't you stop him?
My lord, how could I stop
him from welcoming the King?
God knows what kind
of welcome he would arrange!
He won't use a bow
and arrows, right?
You just don't understand
the gravity of any situation!
Now I have to stop him!
Where is he?
Lord Surya
I don't know of any mantra
but please bless my arrows
with the speed of light.
May no one be harmed by these.
These are
the very same flowers
in whose golden colour reside
the light of Lord Surya and
countless memories of mine.
Vidur, who showered
these flowers?
Such an amazing display
of archery!
Who did this?
This archer has
really pleased me!
Who is this archer?
Come forth!
You deserve the thanks
of mine and the Queen!
Come forth!
Tomorrow herein
I shall step onto
the battlefield
as an undeterred warrior.
With only triumph,
clenching my mind.
Sanjay, today grandsire
shall obliterate the Pandavas' army.
Assume that today,
is the final day of the war.
My sons
shall emerge victorious
while the Pandavas
will concede defeat.
Tell me. What is
happening on the battlefield?
The Pandava warriors are cooking
up a battle formation, my King.
Commander Dhrishtadyumna.
You, along with elder brother
shall confront Duryodhan
at the centerfield
of the battlefield.
Bhima, Nakula, Sahadev.
Attack the forces
of the Kaurava, from the west.
It's your foremost
responsibility
to rebuff Lord Dronacharya.
King Virat, Abhimanyu and I
shall entice grandsire
into battle.
Brother, attack Duryodhan
the moment is vulnerable.
Soldiers, get to your
respective positions
at the earliest.
The battle formation
is about to commence.
Praise the lord!
Praise the lord!
Praise the lord!
Praise the lord!
Grandsire, declare
the battle formations to begin.
You had urged that you would
decimate the Pandava's army.
Incentives are not
achieved by formations
but by a sense of purpose,
Prince Duryodhan.
Why hasn't grandsire
created a formation, yet?
What if, like the first day
he is planning to attack
our army from both sides?
No, Arjun.
Grandsire is a
distinguished General.
The formations,
which his enemies can comprehend
he will never put up with the
same strategy again.
Moreover
war needs a formation
decimate doesn't have one.
Lord Dronacharya, you will stay
at the end of the battlefield.
And shall protect
Prince Duryodhan.
Prince Duryodhan!
You had questioned
my sense of duty.
Today, you shall view
with your own eyes
how I carry through,
my obligation.
Let's move, my friend.
Grandsire!
It's not your Grandsire,
Arjun.
It's Kaurava's accomplished general.
The proficient follower of duty.
The saviour of traditions.
Lord Bhishma!
Pandava!
Get ready,
to engage with Bhishma.
Your army,
will not be allowed to surrender
nor could they take off
from the battlefield.
On this battlefield
the only thing they
could partake in, is death.
The third day of war.
Lord Bhishma had
caused us great many casualties.
With just nine attacks
he annihilated two
battalions of our soldiers.
I could feel for a while
that we weren't facing off
against the grandsire
rather the Lord of Death,
was present.
Pertaining yesterdays
involvement, I thought
Grandsire was
against the Kauravas.
I thought he would
hold off our onslaught.
But wouldn't attack
us in return.
What could have
changed his mind?
His perception has changed,
Sahadev.
Fingers were raised against his
sense of duty.
Henceforth,
he is ready to embrace death
or embark upon, to take up ours.
Hereafter, from today,
our only objective
is the death of grandsire.
[MUSIC]
Fourth day of the war.
Your Grace, we just have four
battalions of soldiers left.
In just a day, Lord Bhishma
had thumped our forces.
And this is just the
fourth day of war.
It is impossible to
defeat grandsire.
Every potent individual
has tried his best.
But grandsire
has always triumphed.
If we do not stop grandsire
then he will
obliterate our armies.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Fifth Day of the War.
The funeral pyres of the enemies
are burning till the horizon
Your Highness.
The wailing of widowed women
is driving a stake through
the hearts of the sons of Pandu.
It seems as though
the torches in their camp
are spreading
darkness instead of light
today, Your Highness.
This very darkness will engulf
their fortune as well, Sanjay.
The power to revolt
against uncle
does not reside
in Lord Indra himself.
Sixth Day of the War.
Your Excellency
the Pandava army has been
reduced to three 'akshauhini.
If you annihilate them
then the war will be over.
No,
Guru Drona.
This war
will not end
until Yudhishthir gets slain
and I must slay him.
Seventh Day of the War.
Seven days ago, we had
seven 'akshauhini' army with us
but now, we merely have
two 'akshauhini' army.
However, they still have nine
akshauhini' army with them.
We tried to attack
grandsire numerous times
but were unsuccessful.
Can no one
revolt against grandsire,
Vasudev?
Every question has an answer,
brother Yudhishthir.
However, it is mandatory
to ask the right question
at the right time.
Vasudev, by the time
we await the right time
we will have no army with us.
We must slay grandsire
at any cost.
"Eighth Day of the War"
The valour of His Excellency
has left everyone perplexed
Your Highness.
For all these days,
neither has he eaten
nor slept a wink.
Then how can such power
get generated in his aged self,
Your Highness?
This is not a war
but my uncle's meditation,
Sanjay.
Its fruits shall be reaped
by my sons.
Mother-in-law
why is great grandsire Bhishma
standing in the battlefield?
Does he not require food,
water and rest?
Grandsire is facing the
punishment of his actions, dear.
In this battlefield
each time he will slay someone
he too will experience death.
But why, mother-in-law?
What did he do?
His Excellency Bhishma
is the sentinel of the
Kuru dynasty in terms of
its memories, power
and righteousness.
However,
blinded by attachment
he allowed unrighteousness,
lies
and deception
to enter Hastinapur.
That is why, he is facing
this punishment today.
As long as
His Excellency is alive
neither will he be
able to sleep
nor take rest.
"Ninth Day of the War."
Renounce your weapons,
dear.
I do not wish to slay you!
Great grandsire,
I leave the camp each day
with the wish to die!
You may certainly slay me!
I am prepared.
Fight me, grandsire!
Give me the opportunity as well
to showcase my competence!
I am not here in the battlefield
to showcase my competence!
This war is my duty and
not my valour, dear!
I am helpless, Arjun!
Irrespective of
who attacks Hastinapur
I must slay him!
Prince Duryodhana
is standing there!
Remember, Arjun!
The orders to drag Draupadi into
a filled royal court as a slave
were issued by him!
Dushyasan, bring that
slave Draupadi to this court!
If that arrogant woman
dares defy my orders
grab her by the hair
and drag her till here!
Look here, Arjun!
This is your uncle, Shakuni!
Today he wields a sword!
But he always tries
to attack by treachery!
Remember
how he conspired to burn all you
five brothers and your mother
in Varanavrath!
In the palace of Varanavrath
all five of our foes
shall be together!
In that very palace
your ascension to princehood
shall be decided!
Now look here, Arjun!
Dushyasan!
These very hands had committed
the audacity
to infringe
upon Panchali's modesty!
Look at Grandsire Bhishma
and Master Drona!
He stayed a mute spectator
as Draupadi was dishonoured!
Look at Ashwatthama over there!
And remember the foul words
he had used!
The one who nurses
a relationship
with five men...
l am ashamed to call her
my sister!
Does your head not crave
for vengeance now, Arjun?
Does your soul not
clamour for justice now?
Does the desire to wield
a weapon does not arise in you?
Does the battle
not seem inevitable now?
Yes, Krishna!
This battle is inevitable!
Now, this battle seems
inevitable to you!
So, look at your Grandsire
once again, Arjun?
And remember
how he provided you with love
and protection at each step!
He sacrificed himself
in an attempt to get justice
for you and your family!
As long as you hold the throne
of Hastinapur as a king
l shall live every moment
to protect you!
But today, please grant
the sons of Pandu
one chance at solace, son!
Once again look at Master Drona
and remember how with
immense love and pride
he bestowed upon you
his supreme knowledge!
You shall be the world's
best archer!
l shall make you
the world's best archer!
This is my promise, son!
Just in order to make you
the world's best archer
he burdened himself with sin!
Remember, Arjun!
If you wish to give me
a souvenir as a disciple
grant me the thumb
of your right hand!
And over there,
look at Vikarna as well.
He was the only one
who dared to oppose
at the royal court that day!
If a King ever loses in battle,
he has to lay down his arms!
But a lady should not be
dishonoured in this manner!
There is a difference between
disarming an enemy and
dishonouring a woman, brother!
And Draupadi is the bride
of the Kuru dynasty!
This is the truth!
ls all this worth killing for,
Arjun?
No, Krishna!
How can I kill them?
Indeed!
But look at the side you are on,
Arjun!
Now look at the side you are on,
Arjun!
Your eldest brother, Yudishtir!
Brother Bheem!
Look at your younger brothers!
Look at your sons
and your nephews!
Many of them shall meet
their demise in this battle!
Doesn't your head feel weakened
by the possibility
of their death, Arjun!
Now also think over
as to what is the fault
of Brother Duryodhana!
If he was greedy for power
and if it is true
if he was conceived earlier...
If Dushyasan committed a crime
by dishonouring Draupadi...
If it is indeed a crime
even you heeded to your
elder brother
and let your wife
be dishonoured!
Wasn't that a crime too?
Grandsire considered his oath
to be more important
and assumed the honour of his
clan's bride as insignificant!
Was that not unfair?
And your eldest brother
Yudishtir
in order to fulfill
his personal obligation
participated in the gamble
in the court!
Was that not unfair?
So, is it appropriate to assume
brother Duryodhana as a foe?
Do you see justice
on your side, Arjun?
You are indeed right, Krishna!
On both sides
I can see justice
and injustice as well!
Therefore
you could never realize
the purpose of the war
nor could you perceive
the form of justice, Arjun!
My mind has gone numb, Krishna!
Every part of me is trembling!
My hands
do not have the strength
to wield a weapon!
My 'Gandiva' bow is repeatedly
slipping of my grasp, Krishna!
I can only foresee
immense destruction!
Only immense destruction!
Why?
What for, Krishna?
What for?
The agony of insult?
The thoughts of injustice
or the oath of vengeance?
I do not have any such reason.
I have no reason, Krishna
to accept such vast catastrophe!
I cannot!
A catastrophe is the foundation
of reformation, Arjun!
If a branch of a tree is cut off
two grow in its place!
Why do you fear
the catastrophe today?
Do you not know the fact that it
shall cause reformation later?
Do not embrace this impotence,
O' Arjuna!
This does not befit you!
This impotence does not
befit you at all!
It is your duty to wage a war,
Arjun!
Raise your weapon!
How can I raise my weapon,
Krishna?
Serving these people
has been the most fortunate
aspect of life!
Such are my Grandsire,
Master Drona, uncle
and my elder brother!
I do not have the courage to
raise my weapons against them!
Even if I attain Heaven
by slaying them
it is futile, Krishna!
It is futile!
Krishna, a man lives
thinking of his future.
Even when I look
at these soldiers
when I look at these
million soldiers
it reminds me
that post the war
countless women
shall be widowed.
Countless children
shall be orphaned.
Tomorrow, when the rules
of society are broken
there shall be none to teach
the values of tradition!
The knowledge of 'Vedas
shall go extinct, Krishna!
The Kuru dynasty
shall be destroyed!
The safety of the Arya clan
shall be destroyed!
It shall all be destroyed,
Krishna!
It shall all be destroyed!
You may preach like a wise man!
But in reality
you speak like a fool, Arjun!
What shall be destroyed?
If a tree sheds a few leaves
or grow new ones
it cannot be held as a reason
for joys or sorrows!
The reason for a leafs creation
and the meaning
of their existence
is just to keep the tree alive!
Similarly, the real reason
and purpose for a man's birth
is the society's well-being!
The society is for the world!
And the entire world
is for creation!
And this entire creation
is for God Himself, Arjun!
The one who realises this fact
can always see the path
to justice clearly!
Yes, Arjun!
There shall be destruction
in this war!
There shall indeed be!
Yes, Arjun!
There shall be destruction
in this war!
There shall indeed be!
But bear this in mind too
that new traditions
shall be formed too!
Old traditions have been
rendered poisonous!
Thousands of years ago
the heritage that was
established by the 'Vedas
now remain as mere words!
The social construct that was
based on a man's intelligence
is now based on a man's birth
and has become a medium
for exploitation, Arjun!
Old constructs shall shatter!
New constructs shall arise!
Old heritage
shall rise again in a new form!
Just as before rainfall
even the cloud strewn skies
look stained
and the land sprawled with
flowers seems tainted as well
the situation is similar today.
And past the rainfall
the skies and the earth
are washed clean!
Similarly, post this war
the society and the world
shall be scourged clean, Arjun!
Post this war
the society and the world
shall be cleansed as well!
Hence give up
your affection, Arjun!
Think of the benefit
of the entire world!
Raise your weapon and wage war!
I can hear your words, Krishna!
But their meanings
do not reach my head!
My mind is clouded by affection!
How do I see through it
and view my duties!
My mind is filled with
thoughts of my dear ones!
How can I think of
the entire world?
Krishna, you had said
that you shall steer my chariot
in the appropriate direction!
Take command of my soul
steer the course of my life
in the right direction, Krishna!
What is it that
after knowing which
I can overcome my weakness?
Rise, Arjun!
Listen, Arjun!
Know the secret of life!
Comprehend the actual form
of creation!
Plunging your fist
into the current of river Ganga
won't give you anything!
But if you dip a cupped palm
into the current of river Ganga
the holy water of Ganga
can be raised to your lips!
Think, Arjun!
Is it a fist of arrogance
or a cupped palm of sacrifice
that you have assumed?
Can you comprehend
this knowledge?
Are you a Knight or 
a coward?
Bheem, be prepared to die.
Those who do not fear death is
true knight, you're stupid.
Think of your sins and ask 
forgiveness to God.
You never do good in this life.
Perhaps you will be reborn...
May you...be better
in the next life.
Bheem!
Dusshasan, in a duel between 
mature Knights...
Immatured knight should 
not interfere.
Keep stalling any longer, friend.
Brother Bheem is not yet winning.
Get up, Duryodhan!
Come on, get up!
Quickly, Duryodhan!
Give up Yudhishthir.
I can not give myself 
to you, Grandsire.
But in this duel I will try 
to beat you.
Yudhishthir I do not want 
to kill you.
Give up,
and I will take you to Duryodhan.
It will end this war, 
my son.
Is Duryodhan to stay alive
to see it, Grandsire?
This is why I hate this war, 
brother Bheem.
To crush you under my feet.
Come on, get up!
Why are you lying on the ground like 
a tail insect, brother Bheem.
Get up, if you have the courage.
Come on, get up!
Hit me. 
Get up.
Your enemy's right in front of you. 
Get up!
Get up, brother Bheem.
Get up!
Get up.
Come on, brother Bheem.
Brother Bheem!
Get up!
You are our pride.
Get up, brother Bheem.
Heeyah!
Mark and remember my vow, 
Duryodhan!
You ordered to undress Draupadi.
First I will pull your tongue and then 
crush your head.
It's impossible.
It's not possible, brother Bheem.
I am the Crown Prince.
King of Hastinapur, Dhristarasta's 
not here.
So I'm in power here.
The right to imprison and kill me is only in the hands of your brother Yudhishthir.
You're stupid, Duryodhan.
Didn't you get authority over the kingdom in uncle's absence.
Then I had authority over the kingdom in my brother's absence as well.
And as the Crown Prince I have 
the right to punish you.
This is why Vasudev told brother 
to head to Hastinapur.
So you will not get 
Grandfather's protection.
Yeah!
Come on, let's get intimate.
Come here, servant Draupadi.
Sit on my lap.
Dusshasan, remove the clothes.
Prince Bheem!
Your king is in my hands.
And without his permission you can't 
attack Prince Duryodhan.
Ha...ha...ha...
And if he ordered you to 
kill Prince Duryodhan,
I'm going to kill him.
Bheem!
If I die, the war will end today.
Kill Duryodhan,
and let Grandsire kills me.
To restore peace in Aryavrat, I'm ready to sacrifice my life.
Strike, Bheem!
The sun will set soon!
Strike, Bheem!
My dear!
Sanjay...
Sanjay, why are you silent?
What happened to my son?
What is going on with Duryodhan?
Quick, tell me!
Majesty,
Bheem has assaulted Prince Duryodhan 
with his mace.
He attacked Duryodhan!
King Yudhishthir is under threat of 
his excellency Bhishma's spear.
Brother Bheem, to win you must 
have more eagerness.
Unless you can let go of your attachment.
Your duty, your brothers and 
also your family,
You will remain bound to them, and victory will always be away from you.
And attachment will only bring 
defeat, brother Bheem.
Just defeat.
My duty, my brothers,
and my family is my courage, 
Duryodhan.
And the day when you have to 
face my courage again...
It will be your last day, 
Duryodhan!
Your last day!
It will soon arrive!
The war is over for today, 
Majesty.
Pandavas had won the war today, Majesty.
But...
uncle did not let their 
victory complete.
He saved my son Duryodhan from Bheem.
Wait and see, Sanjay!
Until uncle in charge in the battleground,
sons of Pandu will not win.
Sons of Pandu's victory is very unlikely.
Our victory today is priceless, 
Emperor Yudhishthir.
Our army courage and spirit 
have increased manifold.
Now they believe that under 
your leadership,
and Vasudev Krishna
we are surely will win.
We achieve victory today.
But Grandsire experience
have beaten us.
No.
Brother Yudhishthir did not fight 
with all his might.
However, Madhav.
Grandsire has a boon to die 
as he wishes.
It is impossible to kill him.
He probably got the boon but it doesn't 
have to be at his will.
It is possible to severely hurt him.
That will cause him can't 
continue this war, friend.
It is also not possible, Vasudev.
Grandsire is the epitome of chastity.
We will not be able
to attack him.
Nobody's that holy, brother Bheem.
Neither the acacia tree nor 
the sandalwood.
When dried, they are ready to burn.
It is a law of nature.
Anyone who tread the road of 
Kaurava's punishment,
must still be destroyed.
People of Kuru
this day has ushered a new
beginning to the Kuru kingdom.
Happier times
and new successes
shall begin today, people.
Before man sets out on a journey
he stands at the gate
takes a look at his house
and embraces each memory
that resides within it.
Today, I too
am reminiscing old memories.
I can recall the time
when, in the royal courtyard
my beloved Dhritarashtra,
Pandu and Vidur
would sit next to me
and study their lessons.
Once, on an early morning,
I saw the three Princes
playing a strange game,
In that game, Pandu and Vidur
had climbed to the
highest branches of a tree
and were calling out
to their eldest brother
while jumping off that tree
with great confidence.
And Dhritarashtra ran to them
and caught them in his arms
and did not let them
fall to the ground.
Upon seeing this, I told
the three Princes to stop.
Then I called Pandu
over to me and asked him
as to
what kind of a game
were the three playing.
I said, they could have died
had they fallen to the ground.
On hearing this,
Pandu smiled and said
that
his elder brother
was standing there
and would never
have let him fall.
Upon hearing this, I told Pandu
that Dhritarashtra
could only hear his voice
but could not see him.
Upon hearing this, Pandu said
that
his elder brother
did not require eyesight
to see him.
He said, his brother's love for
him was enough to help him see.
That day, those three boys
my disciples taught me
a new lesson.
The lesson of love and trust.
Your Majesty
when Lord Yama* must have come to take your younger brother away
The god of death.
he would never
have questioned Him
as to
whom he needed to entrust
his sons with while going away.
I can say with complete
confidence, Your Majesty
that he must never have
put forth this question.
Be it jumping off
branches of a tree
or meeting Lord Yama himself
your younger brother had nothing
but faith in you, Your Majesty.
Only in you.
I will not be able to say
anything more, Your Majesty.
At this point of time
may the Lord motivate you!
This is my blessing.
This is what
I was talking about.
Your Majesty
everyone is eagerly waiting
to hear your announcement.
All my life, I have known
only one warrior
who has never accepted defeat.
And I have always tried
to become proficient like him.
And this is the reason
of my victory.
And that warrior
is my biggest motivation.
My elder brother
Dhritarashtra.
People of Kuru
I am faced
with a terrible dilemma.
I have always had the intention
of choosing the most able Prince
during the coronation ceremony.
That is why
this competition was held.
But unfortunately
the outcome of this competition
was such
that one could draw
different conclusions from it.
The decision is a tough one
because uncle's advice
is appropriate.
A King takes the oath
of being righteous.
When it comes to me, this oath
cannot be forgotten either.
That is why
I must look for righteousness
within my heart
for it is very important.
A King takes the oath
of being righteous.
When it comes to me, this oath
cannot be forgotten either.
That is why
I must look for righteousness
within my heart
for it is very important.
Your Majesty
everyone here
awaits your decision.
You have a righteous heart
and no one doubts this.
You must
ask your heart before taking
the decision, Your Majesty.
I, King Dhritarashtra
announce that
the crowned Prince of Hastinapur
is... - May the Lord
bless the King of Kuru!
Your Majesty
I apologize
for interrupting you!
I know that today
you are going to announce
the heir to the throne
and that is why, I have
come to request to you
that out of my disciples
no one ought to be
chosen in the court.
What do you mean?
- Until a sculptor is satisfied
even the Almighty cannot reside
in the idol made by him.
And that idol cannot be deemed
worthy of worship.
I do not understand you.
Your Majesty
Dronacharya has not yet
been paid by the Princes.
That is why, until the Princes
are his disciples
we cannot coronate
any of the Princes.
So, what does the mighty
Dronacharya expect?
I expect my disciples,
Your Majesty
to pay me in the form of
the art I have taught them.
Let me see, who is the most
superior amongst my disciples.
I wish to see, who is
the most capable disciple.
Indeed, sire.
A teacher testing his disciple
is the most apt way
of judging him.
Then no one shall charge us
for being partial.
Pardon me, Your Majesty!
Pardon me.
What is the need of testing
the capabilities time and again?
If one looks at
one's reflection for too long
one sees ugliness in it,
Dronacharya.
Capability is a virtue
of the soul
and not an adornment
of the face, King of Gandhar.
And it does not show
in a reflection.
But was the competition
not held, Minister?
But there was no definitive
outcome of that competition.
Even His Highness
has agreed to this.
That is why, if the capabilities
are now judged
through the medium
of paying Dronacharya
then what problem
do you have with it?
Certainly.
Since the competition
was inconclusive
resorting to this method
seems appropriate.
So, Dronacharya.
Ask for your fee.
The Prince who will be able
to convince you with his might
shall be the most capable one.
But while seeking your fee
what if you become partial
and choose only
one particular Prince as
the most capable one?
Your doubt is an insult to me,
King of Gandhar.
A teacher can never be partial.
And whether my fee
can be paid by one Prince
or all the Princes
for that matter
is a matter of doubt.
What are you asking for,
Dronacharya?
I want revenge
for being insulted.
The King of Panchal, Drupad
needs to be at my feet.
The King of Panchal, Drupad
needs to be at my feet.
I was insulted gravely
in the court of Panchal once
at the hands
of my friend Drupad.
The hurtful words of an enemy
denote a challenge
but those of a friend
denote an insult.
When a friend insults you
your whole life gets poisoned.
My disciples
I have endured the fire
of this insult within me
and lived for years.
Had I made up my mind,
I could have defeated Drupad
at that very moment
but he
had insulted my art.
That is why, I took an oath
that one day
I will defeat him
at the hands of my disciples!
And today
that moment has come, Princes.
That moment has come, Princes
when you have the opportunity
of fulfilling the vow
of your teacher.
Who will be able
to pay me my fees?
Do you have the capability?
Do you have the capability?
No!
Impossible!
A powerful and experienced
warrior like Drupad
cannot be faced by my sons.
Panchal has more than
two crore soldiers.
And the fort of
the capital city Kampilya
is immense and impenetrable!
No, mighty Drona.
Ask for something else.
This is my fee for teaching,
Your Majesty.
This is not business.
I want either revenge
or nothing else.
If I could not fortify the might
and self-confidence
of my disciples
then it is my misfortune,
Your Majesty.
But you need not feel sad.
I will go to another kingdom
to look for brave men.
I will fortify them with my art
so that they avenge my insult
because, Your Majesty
I shall have my revenge.
Then you must find
the heir to your throne
from another kingdom.
Allow me to leave.
Teacher!
In everyone's life,
there comes an event
when one determines
to disclose a truth
but the truth isn't able
to come out of the mouth.
Some fear embraces the heart.
Talking about an incident
or event
or else talking about
any mistake which one commits...
Is that a true feeling?
No.
This is just a fact.
That means, just disclosing
exactly what happened
is usual.
But sometimes, even while
disclosing that fact
one feels scared.
Perhaps, one thinks about
the emotions of someone else.
They even hesitate to speak
thinking it would hurt someone.
So...what's truth?
Have we ever thought about it?
When someone reveals a fact
even though the fear exists
that's called the truth.
In reality, truth is nothing
but another name of courage.
To be courageous one needn't
wait for the right time
because courageousness
is the nature of the soul.
In other words
isn't every moment right enough
to disclose the truth?
Think about it.
After a few months.
Earlier, messages were being
conveyed through the drum beats.
But now, we have
stopped receiving messages
from the battlefield.
We'll receive a message.
And the message
will surely have a good news.
There is a good news,
Queen Mother.
King Pandu has defeated
his enemies in the battle.
I had faith
that in the first battle itself
Pandu will achieve victory.
Without any controversy,
he has proved himself
as an emperor.
Organise a celebration
in the province.
Nothing should be lacking
in the welcome ceremony.
The period of your happiness
has started, Kunti.
On the very first day
of marriage
if a husband goes far away
I can understand how miserable
a wife feels.
I have no regrets,
sister-in-law.
The first and foremost right
of a king is on his throne.
To be at the second place
I don't have any objection.
- Never say so, Kunti.
When a husband doesn't
pay attention to his wife
her life becomes miserable.
I wish, you always be
your husband's priority.
Now it's time to decorate
your room again.
Maid, go with the other maids
and decorate the king's room
in the best manner.
After the news of victory,
what other news can there be?
Is there any...bad news?
No, grandsire. The news
is not bad but...
What's the news, Chief Minister?
The news is
we, I mean, King Pandu
helped the province Madra
and protected it
from a fierce war.
Subsequently, the king of Madra
requested King Pandu...
He must...
He must have requested.
To refrain His Majesty
from refusing
he must have requested
in a way that... - Vidur
be clear about what
you wish to say.
Queen Mother, the king of Madra
had made King Pandu
his son-in-law.
King Pandu is coming here
with his second wife.
Make arrangements to welcome
King Pandu
and his newlywed wife,
Chief Minister.
A king has many queens.
If King Pandu
does another marriage
this truth will become
troublesome for your life.
As it is, a secret is always
troublesome for a woman.
The arrival of the second wife
of King Pandu in Hastinapur
and into his private chambers
is gladly welcome.
I had a fear that the news
of second marriage of Pandu
will make Kunti sulk.
I felt she wouldn't
welcome Madri
but look, sister
Kunti accepted Madri as
if they were sisters by blood.
The way clothes conceal wounds
similarly, words cloak
feelings, Ambalika.
Anyway, whatever I can
behold exudes auspiciousness.
You trust your eyes
but I have learnt from my son
that eyes seldom
are trustworthy.
Greetings, brother.
Hastinapur and I are
proud of you, Pandu.
Even I am proud of my victory.
On this occasion of victory
I would like to make
an announcement.
Ever since my childhood
I have looked up to only
one warrior.
He never accepted defeat.
He has always celebrated
his struggle.
With his robust character
he has crossed all boundaries
and become the most supreme.
Every move I made in the war was
done following his footsteps.
I always tried to be
worthy of him.
And this is the reason
behind my victory.
And this warrior is the biggest
inspiration of my life
and he is my elder
brother Dhritarashtra.
Pandu...
- Yes, brother...
<i>This victory is not mine
but yours.</i>
Only yours...
See...
It's more like he got
what he wanted
without putting in any efforts.
Stay blessed.
Greetings, grandsire.
I wish you a long life.
Pandu, you have shown
immense valour.
We are proud of you, Pandu.
You must be tired.
Victory turns every
pain into pleasure.
No, Pandu...
Your body gets relief from pain
only after a proper rest.
You need to rest.
For a few months,
along with your wives
you shall go
on a forest excursion.
And that too immediately.
But, Queen Mother...
<i>Pandu...</i>
I don't want any
arguments.
It's a right of your wives
to spend some time with you.
This is an order.
Yes, Queen Mother.
Yours
and the king's room
is on the other side,
Madri.
Rambha!
Yes, Your Highness.
Show Madri
the way to her room.
What are you doing?
I am washing your feet
with my tears, sister.
I heard about
the king's valour in the battle.
And
I lost my heart to
him, sister.
But I didn't know
that His Highness
is already married.
I also didn't know that on
the very next day of marriage
he had to leave
for the battle.
Please forgive me, sister.
During our journey itself,
His Highness told me
that I have to apologise to you
the minute I get here.
I have wronged you.
But an unintentional
wrongful deed
is worthy of being excused,
right, sister?
Won't you accept your
younger sister's apology?
You are not at fault,
Madri.
Don't be sad.
In this palace you will
receive the love and respect
that I get.
After hearing your words
I feel at peace, sister.
I was thinking about you
throughout the journey.
Whether or not to be a subject
of His Highness' affection
I would have to
compete with you.
Or if I would lose to you
in this competition.
I had such doubts.
There is no competition
between us.
That I understood
on seeing you.
I am younger than you
and also much prettier.
If there would be
no competition between us
that would be best for you.
I will leave now.
His Highness must be
waiting for me.
The state of Queen Kunti
saddens me, my lady.
Even I feel sad, Sukhda.
But kings having more
than one wife
is a tradition.
In the presence of pain
and the absence of options
rather than accepting the same
it is referred to
as tradition.
But I completely
trust Pandu.
He will treat both his
wives equally.
Injustice isn't a part of
Pandu's nature.
And neither a part of
his ethics.
Haven't Kunti and Madri gone
with Pandu
on an excursion to the forest?
Just wait and watch
Kunti and Madri will
definitely get along.
Yes, my lady.
Queen Kunti's nature
itself is as such
that anyone would
get along.
And both the wives will receive
love from their husband.
Not being able to receive
a husband's love
is the greatest misfortune.
Greetings, Elder Queen.
Prince Dhritarashtra has sent
a message for you
to come to his chamber.
He has called me!
Yes, Your Highness.
He has called for you.
Give this 'Brahmin
ten cows in charity.
The son of Bharadwaj
does not accept charity,
Drupad.
If you seek alms
then go ahead.
I can write two villages
in your name
on a gold parchment.
But if you talk about rights
you will be
sentenced to death.
I have spent my entire life
burning in the fire of revenge.
You had approached me as a
friend to ask for a few cows.
Had I deemed you my friend
this kingdom would
never have got divided.
I return you your kingdom
that had been conquered,
friend Drupad.
I have committed a crime
by refusing your friendship
and its punishment is
that I should have only
half the kingdom with me.
Pardon me, friend.
You are to die
at the hands of my son
and that is fate.
Everyone dies eventually,
friend.
But today, I am happy to know
that when Dhrishtadyumna
will behead me
it will not be out of anger.
It will certainly be to save me
from some grave crisis.
Then it will be best, guru Drona
if you deem the Prince
to be your son
and impart knowledge to him.
The knowledge imparted by you
will become the medium
of your salvation.
Then it must certainly
be a part of your plan.
That is why, you had
sent me a message to come here.
Vasudev
I had heard a lot
of your greatness
but today...
Today, I have seen it
for myself.
No, guru Drona.
Vasudev
pardon me.
I could not know you.
Your Highness
had you known your daughter's
love and dedication
knowing me would not have
been that difficult.
You have always deemed your
daughters to be your misfortune.
Just look at
Draupadi's greatness.
Look at her dedication.
Even the Kaumodaki mace
of Vasudev Krishna
was pacified by her.
Draupadi!
Stop, Draupadi!
Draupadi...
Draupadi.
Let's go inside, Draupadi.
I cannot go inside, sister.
I have been banished
from the city.
Draupadi, come inside
and apologize to father.
I am certain.
He shall certainly pardon you.
If a chariot loses its wheel
the wheel loses its definition.
But even after
a chariot loses its wheel
it is still called a chariot.
A child is identified
by its father's name.
Please do not bring arrogance
into the picture, Draupadi.
This is not arrogance, sister
but the ones who have
no self-respect
they cannot command
respect from others.
And in order
to have self-respect
it is important for me
to know first
what the purpose of my life is
and what my strengths are.
Goodbye, sister.
Attendant, to honour
Princess Draupadi
make the necessary arrangements
for a grand procession.
Prepare a gold palanquin!
She will enter the royal court
with great pomp and show!
Where is Draupadi?!
Where is she?
Father
Draupadi has decided
to leave Kampilya.
Impossible.
Impossible.
My...
My daughter cannot
renounce her kingdom.
She must certainly be unaware
that today, because
of Vasudev Krishna
I have had a change
of heart, Shikhandini!
S-She must not have gone far.
I shall go and bring her back!
Your Highness
let me
accomplish this task.
Princess Draupadi.
Princess
tell me what you did exactly.
W-Which mantra did you use?
Share that knowledge
with me, Princess.
Help me better myself.
I did not use any mantra.
No, you certainly did.
You pacified my magical
Kaumodaki mace!
How?
You must... You must
teach me that mantra
otherwise...
Otherwise I will jump off
the cliff and kill myself
and you will be
responsible for it.
Stop!
I did not use any mantra.
I had gone there
only to protect my father.
I do not believe you.
Without the knowledge of mantras
you could never
have protected him.
I am leaving.
- But I can
certainly brave the weapon
being charged at him.
In other words, you had
used the mantra of love.
Then I need not fear.
Everyone knows
the mantra of love
but no one is able to use it.
Now, if you wish
to jump off the cliff
you are free to do so.
Go right ahead.
I do not wish
to jump off the cliff.
I am merely looking for
the answers to some questions.
What is the importance
of my birth?
What is the purpose of my life?
To make my father accept
and respect me
what must I do?
So many questions!
And all of them
are worthless.
Your question should be
as to who you are.
If you know yourself
then you will get
all the answers.
Who am I?
Every person is an image
of the Almighty
but no one knows this.
In ash are hidden embers
and in ignorance...
In ignorance is hidden the soul.
And the one who is
unable to see himself
has the desire
of others to see him.
We wish other people to tell us
what we are
and who we are.
But others are surrounded
by their own ignorance.
And the one who
does not know himself
cannot tell us who we are.
In order to know who I am
what must I do?
You must bear righteousness
and in order to
re-establish righteousness
you must make
the necessary efforts.
But how will I
know righteousness?
Before knowing righteousness
you need to know its bases.
Righteousness has five bases
knowledge, love
justice, dedication
and patience.
Did you not ask me, Draupadi
why you were born?
You have been born to acquire
the five bases of righteousness.
The Gods have said
that you will build the
future of the Aryan region.
You will help
re-establish righteousness
in the entire world.
And this will only be possible
when these five bases
namely
knowledge, love
justice
dedication and
patience will be
acquired by you.
Shall we go now?
Life is waiting
for you, Draupadi.
Who are you truly?
Me?
I am the protector of cows.
My friends call me Govind.*
*Among his most common names are Mohan "enchanter", Govinda, "Finder of the cows", or Gopala, "Protector of the cows".
Krishna, my Krishna.
The one who lifted the Govardhan* was Krishna.
*He lifted the Govardhana hill and prevent the devastation of its pasture land by Indra.
The one with
a peacock feather...
Answer a question
of mine, Govind.
Did I truly
pacify that mace?
What do you think, Draupadi?
You had pacified it.
But it had been
pacified for you.
That is why,
the credit goes to you.
Shall we go now
friend?
Why is it taking
so long, Hidimba?
I am almost done
luring them, brother.
Bring them to the village
as soon as possible!
I have promised the ogres
that after years,
they shall have
tasty human meat.
Everyone is awaiting them
back in the village!
Bring them there
as soon as possible!
Come here...
Closer...
I cannot wish
for your victory, brother.
I am
on your opponent's side now.
Pardon me.
By giving us your
unparalleled Narayani Army
you have shown us the path
to victory, Vasudev.
Now,
even if
you do not wish for our victory
we will
not blame you.
King of Gandhar
the way the strength of a bow
lies with the archer
similarly the strength of
an army lies with its General.
The Narayani Army is indeed
a superlative one in the world
but in the absence
of an exceptional General
even the Narayani Army can fail.
We would never worry
about that, Mighty Balaram.
We have
Maharathi Bhishma with us
as our General.
Until you have
His Excellency Bhishma with you
there is no need for the
Narayani Army, King of Gandhar.
But after His Excellency
gets slain
who will lead the Narayani Army
as its General?
Slaying grandsire Bhishma
is impossible,
Vasudev
because he has been
blessed with the boon
to die at will.
Brother
the result of a war
cannot be predetermined
like a game of dice.
Even His Excellency
can die.
That is not possible,
Vasudev.
Without using treachery
His Excellency Bhishma
cannot be killed.
Besides,
the side you have chosen
is a righteous one.
You cannot use treachery.
That depends upon the definition
of treachery, King of Gandhar.
Lord Ram was hiding
behind a tree
when he attacked Bali,
the King of the Monkeys.
You seemed to have
forgotten that, King of Gandhar.
And in order to slay
Dashanan Ravan
his brother Vibhishan
was approached for help.
If righteousness is
at the core of treachery
then even treachery
can be righteous
King of Gandhar.
In other words
you will engage in treachery
Vasudev?
Indeed.
In this war
the Pandavas
will emerge victorious
by any means possible.
Maharathi Bhishma
Guru Drona
and King Karna of Anga
will indeed be slain
and that too by using treachery.
If there is
a way to safeguard
all three of them
then go ahead and find it.
Panchali
the time to punish
your offenders has been set.
The date mentioned by you
in this letter
will be the day
the great war begins.
The great war had begun
the very day, My Lord
when the thought of
a game of dice had stemmed
in the mind of
the King of Gandhar.
On that day
the reign of unrighteousness
will come to an end.
The one 'akshauhini
Narayani Army of Dwaraka
will battle for us,
father.
We now have
ten 'akshauhini' armies with us
while the Pandavas
have a maximum
of only
seven 'akshauhini' armies.
They have
the great Yadava Krishna
with them
son Duryodhan.
Even without the aid of an army
he had defeated Jarasandha
destroyed Kalyavan
and slayed
King Kansa of Mathura.
He...
And Shri Krishna is miraculous,
Your Highness.
The entire Aryan region
resonates of the tale
of how he had straightened
Trivakra's crooked back.
He had slayed
the female ogre Putana
when he was only six-months-old.
These are false tales,
Minister.
Merely false tales.
Who has seen
these so-called miracles?
Do not forget,
Duryodhan
that in this very court
Vasudev Krishna had defended
the honour of Drupad's daughter.
When Krishna
was not present here
how could he have
defended her, grandsire?
The daughter of Drupad
was born of fire, grandsire.
She is an illusory being.
How can someone be born of fire?
She must indeed be an ogre.
But we fear no one
and by spreading
such false tales
do not demonstrate
your fear,
grandsire.
Fear?
We fear for you,
Crown Prince.
You hope to win
with the aid of the army
but you seem to be forgetting
that if the entire army
of the crows
catches even a glimpse of Garuda
then the entire army
will flee from the battlefield.
The Garuda you are
talking about, Minister
has relinquished his beak
and claws voluntarily.
Vasudev will not
take to arms in this war
and everyone knows this.
Pardon me but now is
not the time to get scared
by thinking of the competence
of the enemy.
In fact, it is time for us
to examine our competence
and augment our self-confidence
because self-confidence
is the basis of competence.
Fear and apprehension are
vital for survival, dear Karna.
Be calm.
Before the war
it is necessary to examine
every viewpoint.
Every viewpoint...
But the Pandavas have
already challenged us to a war
Your Highness.
But the Pandavas have
already challenged us to a war
Your Highness.
They have even decided
the date of the war.
They...
They decided the date!
They decided the date...
The Pandavas seek an answer
from you, Your Highness.
Wage a war
or seek their refuge.
Seeking their refuge is out
of the question, friend Karna.
It is impossible.
We are prepared for the war!
Stop,
son Duryodhan.
Before we give them an answer,
it is vital to meditate over it.
Meditate?
Where is the time
to meditate over this, father?
Those Pandavas
have asked for an answer
from us today itself!
And what should we
meditate over?
Should we
meditate over
seeking their refuge, father?
No, son.
No.
I do not know if this date
will bring good fortune
f-for my sons or not.
Be calm.
We need to meditate over this.
Minister
the Great Sage Jaimini!
The Great Sage Jaimini
is the most renowned astrologer
in the entire Aryan region.
Send him an invite immediately.
As you say,
Your Highness.
I wish to know what
the result of this war will be.
I must find out whether this war
will benefit my sons
or...
Or will the presence of Krishna
become the good fortune
of the Pandavas.
Dear Abhimanyu
do you
see the gates to
the city of Virat over there?
Very soon
the formidable army of the
Pandavas will exit from there
and move northward
towards the kingdom of Kuru.
At that moment
the chariot behind the General
will be yours,
dear.
Will you be
the General, uncle?
No.
A person who will
not take to arms
cannot be the General.
Then who will be the General?
No matter who
the General is, dear
but the Commander
will be no one but you.
The task of taking this war
from the possibility of defeat
to the hope of victory
will be done by you,
dear.
I hope such a major
responsibility
does not scare you,
dear.
Why would I be scared,
uncle?
A sword is hungry
for blood after all.
A heart that has
the enthusiasm of victory
has no place
for the fear of death.
I am proud of you,
dear.
This war will usher a new era.
The old era will end
when His Excellency Bhishma
will be slain
and the new era will begin
because of you.
May the Empress have happiness!
Prince Arjun and Vasudev Krishna
will be here in the city
of Virat in a while.
Bring the items
for welcome, maid!
On my behalf
have gold coins and wheat
distributed in the kingdom.
Have a festival held!
Prince Abhimanyu should be
welcomed in a grand manner.
Make haste,
maid!
Are the five sons of yours not
arriving as well, Your Highness?
Father has sent a message
that he shall be here
with the army very soon
and the five sons of mine
will also arrive with him.
Ever since we moved away
from Indraprastha
I have not seen them.
I have never seen
Prince Abhimanyu
and the other Princes.
I am so eager to meet
all of them, Your Highness!
In times of struggles
when a child is born
with the hope of a new future
one's courage gets augmented,
Your Highness.
People are talking solely
about Prince Abhimanyu
in the entire palace,
Your Highness.
And very soon,
the entire Aryan region
will talk about him.
He is the son of Arjun,
the bearer of the Gandiva.
He is the child of Subhadra,
the sister of Govind.
He is the disciple
of Govind himself.
He is the brother
of the five sons of mine.
Yajnaseni Panchali
is his mother.
Pardon me,
Your Highness
but he is not your son.
He is the son
of Princess Subhadra.
No other child can be dearer
than one's own.
The affection of a child
who is born of another woman
can never be had by us.
Even if all the trees
grow in the same woods
not all the fruits
have the same taste.
I know quite well
that if you are
victorious in the war
then the Yadavas will make
Abhimanyu the next King.
However,
if you lose
then Abhimanyu
will apologize to Hastinapur
and settle in Dwaraka.
The only ones to make
a sacrifice for you
will be the five sons of yours
and not Abhimanyu.
You have not been able to
comprehend King Pandu's dynasty
Queen Sudeshna.
Sacrifice and righteousness
run through the veins
of this dynasty.
Your Highness
you have lost the independence
of your younger brothers,
servants Nakul and Sahadev
in the game.
My darling,
who will you bet now?
When there is a reduction
in the opponent's property
playing the game
becomes truly enjoyable.
However, when there is
a reduction in his might
winning the game
becomes a joyful experience!
Uncle
Arjun will be my servant now.
A person who is
at par with Arjun...
Do you even have such a
person with you, Duryodhan?
My friend
King Karna of Anga!
The son of a charioteer!
How is the son of a charioteer
at par with a Prince?
Crown Prince Bheem!
Yes, I am the son
of a charioteer
but abducting a woman
who is to be married
to someone else
can be done only by ogres!
Friend Duryodhan,
have you decided to bet me
against such an amoral person?
No, friend.
I have decided
to make him your servant.
Friend Karna
will you give me the permission
to bet you in the game?
He shall indeed
give you the permission!
King Karna of Anga
has even sold his soul to you!
On behalf of Emperor Yudhishthir
I bet myself in the game!
Dear, Crown Prince Duryodhan
has bet
your husband in the
game of dice being played.
Until now, he was an accessory
to unrighteousness
but today
he is just a means.
Today, I am ashamed
to call Karna
as my son.
Human beings are
being treated like property
and being bet in the
game of dice, father-in-law!
Yes, dear.
I got to know from the
charioteer of the Crown Prince
that Duryodhan will enslave
the five sons of Pandu.
And in the end, by enslaving
the innocent daughter of Drupad
she will be subjected to insult.
Queen Mother.
Go on, Your Highness.
Just four more points
and you will reach
the castle square.
Uncle, my patience
is giving in now.
Make haste in making
Arjun my servant.
Your Highness,
I say this with great grief
that another piece of yours
has been captured.
You now have
only one piece with you.
You need to save it.
Only then will
Prince Arjun be safe.
Only twelve more points
to win this.
Go on, my dice.
Prince Arjun has been
lost by the Emperor.
May the Emperor have happiness!
Friend Karna
I give you a servant
as a present.
Arjun.
And Arjun,
where is your bow?
What is it called again?
The Gandiva,
brother Duryodhan.
I have heard that Agni Dev
had preyed upon the illusion
of the Khandavprastha forest
and had used that illusion
to make that bow, brother.
Give it to Karna.
Give your bow
to Karna, Arjun.
The blessing of Agni Dev
in the hands of a servant
does not befit him.
Give Karna your bow, Arjun!
Give it!
Do accept it,
King Karna of Anga.
If I have your permission
then I shall imprison each God
residing in the heavens
and have each one of them
make such a bow for you.
I have lost my independence
but not my competence.
Keep it with you, Arjun.
Keep your Gandiva with you.
I do not require
any celestial bow.
My skills as an archer
are celestial by definition.
Servant Arjun
go and kneel down over there.
We need to begin the game.
Your Highness
shall we begin the game?
You may certainly begin,
King of Gandhar!
The Emperor shall bet me
in this round of the game.
Get up, Duryodhan!
You need to bet yourself
against me.
No, brother Bheem.
I shall bet my beloved
younger brother
Dusshasan against you.
This is the only opportunity
to defeat me, Duryodhan.
You will never be able
to defeat me henceforth.
Your Highness
shall we begin the game?
I pardon you in advance for
losing my independence, brother.
I know that you shall lose me
but my mace shall never be
subservient to another!
Not even for a moment!
May the Emperor have happiness!
If we have your permission
then may we begin the game?
Before losing my independence,
will you answer a question?
After losing
your younger brothers
do you still take pride in your
character and righteousness?
I am ashamed of myself, Bheem.
I have no pride.
Then you cannot bet
yourself in this game.
If you remain independent
then you shall free us soon.
Go on and play,
King of Gandhar.
Go on, my dice.
King of Gandhar
only six more points
and your piece will
capture that of brother.
Go on and play.
Your piece has captured
that of brother.
I think, you will win
this round as well.
He shall indeed win,
brother Bheem
but has he ever wondered
what all he has lost
by winning this round?
No, he has not!
Keep quiet,
servant!
Servants do not have
the permission to interfere!
Then you may
punish us, brother.
Uh!
Master Duryodhan.
You should resume the game now.
Go on, my dice.
There you go,
King of Gandhar.
I have even lost
my younger brother Bheem.
Now, even Bheem is your servant.
Brother Duryodhan
you now have nothing
in your property
which you can bet in the game
and neither do I have
anything with me
in which I take pride.
I have lost all my pride.
So, I quit the game.

Son Karna,
your mother is here.
Hoping to get something
in charity from you.
Will you be able
to make her an offering?
Queen Mother.
No, son.
Just mother.
Your mother.
It took tremendous courage
to come to you.
Tremendous courage...
It took so long
for a Warrior's mother
to gather courage?
At the time
of your birth
I didn't have
the courage.
I had to face
the entire society.
I could have accepted
my character being questioned
but
what about my father's honour?
How could've
I tarnished that, son?
Definitely your father's dignity
must have been more valuable
than your son's life.
No, son.
I have committed
a big mistake.
I lacked the sense
to understand
the result that
my mistake would yield.
I am the result of your mistake.
My entire life is the result
of your mistake.
I...
I'm here to rectify
that mistake, son.
I'm here to be
your mother.
Now you come
to be my mother?
Now you come?
What do I do
about that mother of mine
who has stayed up
for many nights, weeping
whenever I slept hungry?
Whenever someone ridiculed me
upon seeing a bow in my hand
she held my hand
and taught me tolerance.
What do I do
about that mother
who is weeping
right now
because now people will
no more address me as her son
but as someone
else's son?
What do I do
about that mother
who embraced me
when you abandoned me?
What do I do
about that mother?
Abandoning you
was my mistake.
Please forgive me, son.
Forgive me.
But
I am here now
as your mother.
We can change
the circumstances, son.
We can change everything.
How can one change
the past, Queen Mother?
You had abandoned me.
Can you change that?
I was always in front of you
but you never accepted me.
Can you change
this situation?
My younger brothers
are my enemies, today.
Can you change
this situation?
A fruit fallen
off a tree
cannot be put back
on the tree, Queen Mother.
No one can change
the past.
Neither you, nor me...
No one.
Your son has drowned
in the tide of misfortune
in which you had
abandoned him.
Queen Mother.
Please
help me find
my son, Karna.
Where will you
look for him?
Even after the inferno
has calmed down
you can feel the heat
in the ashes.
In the same manner
even your son
is burning
in the flames
of pain and humiliation.
Don't try to find him now,
Queen Mother.
We can end this complexity,
this bitterness, son.
Now, you will no more
receive pain
insult or tears.
You will now be called
a Pandava.
You'll be referred to
as the eldest of my sons.
Abandon Duryodhana's side, son.
Come to the side of your
brothers and guide them.
Abandon my friend?
The hand that helped me gain
foot during troubled times...
You want me
to leave that hand?
If this is how I repay for all
the favours bestowed on me
will that make you
proud of me?
Duryodhana has always been
unrighteous.
Why are you taking his side,
son? - Because he had once
committed a righteous deed.
In the arena, that day
he kept aside
caste, creed
social classes, position
and everything
and offered his friendship
to me.
The righteous grandsire Bhishma
never did any such thing.
The knowledgeable mentor Drona
never did this.
Even the person who gave
birth to me
did not lend her support.
During those dark times
only one hand
offered support.
And for that one
righteous deed
I can sacrifice a hundred lives
for Prince Duryodhana.
My weapons will forever
be indebted to
Prince Duryodhana, Queen Mother.
Will you wield arms
against your own brothers, son?
And that will be the most
disastrous result
of the mistake
you've committed.
Even after I surrendered
to Duryodhana
why did you not accept me?
Had you done so, mother
then today, I would have
been known as your son.
I would have stood
in your favour.
But now...
Now, the time has changed.
I am...
I am bound today.
I witness immorality
and atrocity at every step.
My soul dies
at every step, but I...
I am bound by a promise.
Buried under favours bestowed.
I cannot sacrifice the prince.
I cannot give up on my promise.
I would lose
my self-respect, then.
Whenever my arrows
would injure my brothers
my heart would bleed too.
I would have to live
through this anguish.
But, I...
I cannot break my vows
and go against my duties.
Then do not participate
in the war, son.
Even that encompasses creed.
Vrushali has a question
for you, Queen Mother.
Is it reasonable for one's
pride to be their creed?
Or is one being proud
of their creed
appropriate?
One's creed turning
into their pride
is legitimate.
I am aware of my creed.
I cannot renounce it.
Neither my creed
nor Prince Duryodhana.
Farewell, Queen Mother.
You chose to remain silent
throughout your life.
But the pain
was borne by me alone.
I am accustomed
to living in anguish.
But by breaking your silence
please do not hurt everyone.
Do not tell my five brothers
about this truth.
I am well aware
that they are firm
in their creed.
They would surrender
immediately.
And I...
I would slay their competence
and dedicate it
to Prince Duryodhana.
Let the war materialise, mother.
Do not inform them
of my torment.
Their joy lies
in their ignorance.
I have...
I have always lived
as the son of Radha
and that will be my identity
till death.
How can I help it, son?
My own sons
slaying each other...
How can I be an audience to it?
How can the consequences
of one error of mine
be so dreadful?
How is it fair, son?
How can it be so?
How?
How could it be so?
Weren't you here to ask
for a grant, mother?
Let me accord you with one.
You would need to mourn
the death of only one son.
I wouldn't slay the remaining
four sons of yours.
Only Arjuna and I
would combat to vanquish
the other.
If I die
at the hands of Arjuna
all five sons of yours
would remain alive.
But if Arjuna dies
at my hands
even then five sons of yours
would remain alive.
Because then...
I would address you as 'mother'.
This is my promise,
Queen Mother.
And this is my grant to you.
Karna...
Madhav has sent a message.
Hastinapur has rejected
our peace treaty.
I will direct all of our troops
to leave for the river route.
- They don't want peace
but don't mind facing
total obliteration.
Don't say that, Your Highness.
You can term this as the first
step of a new beginning.
You are right.
Arjuna... Bhima... Send a message
across to all our allies.
Request all of their armies
to assemble with ours.
My dear sons, take note
of your weapons and courage.
Get ready for war!
Arjun!
Stop, Duryodhan.
Dusk sets is not because of a person.
But because of time.
Hence, don't get angry, dear.
Because tomorrow morning.
You will need both anger and courage.
Grandsire...
Soldiers!
Grandsire's head needs support.
Go and get some pillows.
No, dear.
I don't need any kind of comfort.
It isn't nice to wish
for any kind of comfort,
during one's last journey.
The less the burden of comforts are,
the easier the journey gets.
Dear,
don't give my head any comfort.
Just keep it in an upright position.
Arjun!
If a warrior gets...
the support of arrows,
after his death he goes to heaven.
Grandsire
I have hurt you a lot.
I have hurt you a lot.
I even insulted you, Grandsire.
But the respect my heart holds
for you has never reduced.
I have always seen you as the
leader of Hastinapur, Grandsire.
The leader who stopped you from
reaching the limit of skies.
Today...
Now, the leader is going
to go away from all of you.
I hold no anger against you.
If you seek forgiveness from me today
I will definitely forgive you, dear.
F- Forgive... Forgive me, Grandsire.
Forgive me, Grandsire.
And bless me, so that I
attain victory, Grandsire.
- Bless me.
- No, dear.
I cannot grant your wish.
Because I have already blessed
Yudhisthir to be victorious.
I cannot do politics anymore.
But...
Even you have right
on my blessings, dear.
I...
bless you,
that while breathing your last,
your face will have a
smile of contentment.
If...
you achieve contentment
out of righteous deeds,
you will go to heaven.
But if you achieve contentment
out of unrighteous deeds,
you will go to the nether world.
Now, the decision is up to you, dear.
Grandsire, even while dying you
couldn't give up on your inclinations.
I had thought that in your last moments,
you would show some generosity.
But no...
you have always been against me, Grandsire.
Look, Grandsire...
The sun is moving towards the south now.
It is believed
that the sun moving towards the north,
leads one to heaven.
And the sun that heads towards the south,
takes one to the nether world.
This is your punishment, Grandsire.
It is the punishment for your partiality.
You will have to suffer in
the nether world, Grandsire.
You have to suffer.
Duryodhan,
what kind of a misdeed
you have committed?
How could you curse Grandsire?
All these are pointless, Bheem.
One paves the way to heaven
or hell by one's actions.
The movement of sun has
nothing to do with it.
Grandsire Bhisma had found
himself a place in heaven.
The minute he sacrificed traditions
and recognised the true
form of righteousness.
Hence
you don't need to worry, Bheem.
You are blessed with the
boon of self willed death.
Free yourself from this pain.
No, dear.
Pain
sacred the soul.
Pain cleanses the soul, dear.
All of you
should stop worrying about my pain.
I have
decided
that I
will lie down on this bed of arrows
and await my death every moment.
My lifelong deeds
will continue to hurt me
in the form of arrows, Vasudev.
The way
even elderly person is followed
by deeds of his lifetime.
When Yudhistir receives knowledge,
Bheem receives justice,
Arjun receives prestige, and Nakul and Sahadev receives happiness and contentment.
Only then will I be able
to let go of this body.
When the throne of Hastinapur
sees justice and courage together.
Only then will the
subjects of the Kuru dynasty
experience heaven on earth.
Only then
will I accept my departure to heaven.
Now
I wish to be left alone, Pandavas.
I want to bear this pain
all alone.
All of you should now depart.
That's an order.
Your highness,
Hastinapur's flag has been destroyed.
And the pillar that held it
high, too has been brought down.
Hastinapur's flag...
has been destroyed.
I know everything, Vidura.
I know everything.
I know that the Pandavas have brutally
attacked Hastinapur's dignity and prestige.
All the five had together attacked, Vidura.
Grandsire's pious body,
was tarnished with arrows by them, Vidura.
With arrows!
Pandavas, Your Highness?
Your sons were the one who 
made the attack.
An old man, who has the rights on all the comforts in the world. He was handed weapons...
And taken to the battlefield,
by your sons.
The one who should be
respected and honored...
The eldest member of such a family...
has been injured with various
humiliations and poisonous...
allegations by your son.
Whose death-bed...
deserves to be as soft
as a mother's heart.
That old man.
is lying on a death-bed 
made of arrows
because of your sons.
Even when the birds 
leave their nest,
they don't destroy it.
But your sons...
Your sons set the roof under
which this family lives on fire.
- Prime Minister! 
- Not Prime Minister, Your Highness!
I have renounced that position,
the day this battle began.
If you want to punish me, 
then lift the sword,
and kill me, beheaded me.
But I will not be able 
to stay quiet today.
Instead of letting such 
children live,
why didn't you kill them
at the time of their birth?
Vidura!
Are you watching?
Look, my hands lost 
their strength.
My feet...
My feet cannot take the burden 
of my body!
In such circumstances,
don't wound my heart, my dear.
Don't leave me in times like this.
It's your sons that have
wounded many hearts, sire.
The place of the coal is in the stove.
You cannot place it on the throne.
Your son is the coal of 
this lineage, sire.
And you,
tried to give that son 
the throne!
That is Kuru dynasty's and 
your misfortune, sire.
I have renounced you, sire.
I will not see you even at the 
time of your death.
Even your shadows seems 
like fire to me.
Yes.
Till King Yudhistira's arrival,
I will continue to protect
the throne and the nation,
to the best of my ability.
And keep in mind, sire.
This battle will not continue
for as long as it has been,
going on.
All your 100 sons will be killed.
And soon the Pandavas,
will be victorious and succesfull.
And you...
You will sit here,
and mourn, sire.
My concsience will cursed you!
Cursed!
Enter into a duel
or accept defeat!
- Duryodhan, defeat...
Calm down!
Lord!
All the princes would return
to Hastinapur tomorrow.
You have to arrange
for a celebration.
Celebrate about what?
Gandhari, only victory
can be celebrated.
Not failure.
And today, I have been defeated.
Defeated!
But lord, the princes of
Hastinapur have been victorious.
The subjects always
like celebrations.
But when my son returns
on hearing praises on the
paths of Hastinapur
what would be his plight,
Gandhari?
When the subjects sing praises
about Pandu's sons
how would my Duryodhan
tolerate it?
I...
I am blind.
But my son is not.
In the lamps lighted on the
doorsteps of the subjects
he would see all his desires
on fire, Gandhari.
All the desires.
If one dislikes the image
seen in the mirror
then the mirror isn't at fault.
Instead, the appearance
is at fault.
The subjects are like
the mirror.
Whatever the subjects
portray is the truth.
The truth about us and
Duryodhan is that
as the heir to the throne
only Yuddhistir has
the authority.
How would he agree to it?
How would he?
How would my Duryodhan sacrifice
his dream to become the king?
How would he bow his head
before Yuddhistir?
How would he?
Yuddhistir, let's
decide right now
between us.
Who is the strongest?
Who is destined to win?
I consider a duel with you
as a defeat, Duryodhan.
A fight between the princes
of the Kuru dynasty
isn't appropriate.
When two logs of
wood are rubbed
it results in fire.
And all the woods
burn down to ashes.
I don't need a preaching.
I need a result.
The throne of Hastinapur
belongs to me.
You must either take an oath
that you sacrifice the
throne of Hastinapur
or fight a duel.
I take an oath...
- Brother!
Do not take an oath which
would hurt our father's soul.
Duryodhan, I take an oath.
Whatever king Dhrithrashtra
decides
I will agree with it.
To make a promise
other than this
would be like deceiving the
subjects of the Kuru dynasty.
And the decision of
king Dhrithrashtra is
that his son
be coronated on the throne
of Hastinapur.
And that will surely happen.
Hastinapur.
Panchaal.
Dhrupad will himself
perform the rituals
towards Ashwathama.
Dhrupad will himself
coronate Ashwathama
on the throne.
I return the half of the
divided kingdom to you.
You have no son
of your own, anyway.
Father...
- Everything is ruined.
The way in which age old trees
get destroyed in a forest fire...
In the same way,
an ancient kingdom...
The popularity of which
could embarrass even the Gods.
The grand valour
of the ancestors...
Everything is ruined...
Everything is ruined!
If there is a forest fire
it only makes the land
more fertile, father.
More trees grow on
the same land.
I am sure there would
come a time again
when Panchaal's flag of victory
will be hoisted on the
palace of Hastinapur.
Who will bring such a time?
Who will bring such times?!
Who will bring such times?!
Would you?!
You are a helpless woman.
Would you be fighting a war
against those ace warriors?
You were defeated in
the very first attack!
You haven't witnessed the
potentials of Pandu's sons.
Haven't you heard the
sound of Arjun's bow string?
I felt like
it was Lord Indra's weapon.
They are undefeatable.
Would you raise your
weapons before them?
Would you point your
weapons at them?!
Yes, father.
Time defeats the greatest
of warriors.
But time cannot defeat me.
Father, I cannot die
until I kill Bhishma.
You know that very well.
These talks are futile,
Shikandini.
I do not agree that you have
been blessed by Lord Shiva!
I was a fool
to consider you as a
potential resource.
Shikandini, one cannot apply
turmeric on silver ornaments
and turn them into gold.
You are useless to me.
Go, Shikandini!
You are useless to me.
Only a perfect son
is greater than a mighty
and well-equipped army.
Until I do not attain a son
I will consider myself
childless!
I need a son
who can behead Drona.
Who can sit on the throne of
Hastinapur
and rule.
A competition?
What kind of competition,
father?
Sire Bhishma and
the chief minister termed
it as a competition.
We do not agree to it.
Dushasan is right, father.
Tomorrow, you have to
announce at the royal court
that your son will be your heir.
How would I, son?
Show me a way.
How would I?
You can give a mere reason.
Even if your prove that Dhrupad
or Drona cheated you
I will immediately declare
you as my heir, son.
What are you saying, father?
What is the need to
look for a solution?
You are the king!
When the sun rises, the moon
and the stars have to fade.
No one has the authority to
speak before the king.
Son, a king is independent.
He cannot be partial, though.
I cannot decide as I wish, son.
When you have no doubts over the
superiority of the Pandavas
how can I make the
subjects doubt over it?
This means, you will announce
Yuddhistir as the King tomorrow.
Father, I believed you.
I wouldn't agree to it
at any cost.
At court, if you declare
Yuddhistir as the King
then I would revolt.
- No! Don't you do that, son.
Don't do that.
If you revolt, then...
- Then?
You would appoint an
army against me.
I know that.
The king who doesn't punish
the one who revolts
he has to renounce his kingdom.
Father.
Would you declare a war
against your sons?
Charcoal is born out of fire.
But even then, if charcoal
falls into fire
it's the duty of the fire
to burn it into ashes.
Hail the sons of Pandu!
- Hail!
Hail the sons of Pandu!
- Hail!
Hail the sons of Pandu!
- Hail!
Father, you can continue
with your rightful duties.
The chance is standing
right in your courtyard!
But you must mark my words.
At court, if you declare
Yuddhistir as the King
I will destroy the honour and
respect of Hastinapur. - No!
That's a promise.
- No...
Duryodhan!
Duryodhan...
Duryodhan!
Duryodhan.
Greetings, King.
We have been victorious,
thanks to your blessings.
We have fulfilled our duty
towards our teacher.
Bless you.
Your deed must have pleased
your teacher, Drona.
Am I right?
Greetings, your highness.
- Bless you.
Congratulations on winning
the competition.
May God bless you.
Greetings, sister.
Greetings, Dhrishtadyumna.
Vasudeva
this Brahman
who has sworn never
to ride a chariot
are you sure
that he will one day
sit on the throne?
Your daughter will definitely
sit on a throne, Your Highness.
You're
worried about
your daughter's future.
But every day
and every moment
of the future
has been decided.
Your Highness, future
is nothing but
the result of our present
decisions and deeds.
If you're happy with the
decisions you took today
then have faith
you will definitely be blessed
with a happy future.
A difficult competition
of archery
was won by a Brahman, Vidur.
Yes, sir.
Even the message
of our spy reads the same.
That when no prince
could triumph
the princess was married
to a young Brahman.
Then, Vidur
you will have to leave
for Kampilya, immediately
in order to get
that young Brahman
his four brothers
and mother
to Hastinapur.
But no one should learn that
the five Pandavas are alive.
Before Shakuni formulates
another conspiracy
get all the five Pandavas
and their mother to Hastinapur.
Definitely, grandsire.
Brahman Batukeshwar
isn't it necessary during
a marriage to know the names
of the bride and the groom?
Uh!
I didn't ask this young Brahman
his name.
What's your name?
V-Vateshwar.
Vateshwar!
And what's your lineage?
Lineage?
Why do you want to know
about my lineage?
I should know your lineage in
order to get you two married.
Hey!
Hey!
Someshwar...
Someshwar!
Someshwar.
Som...
Someshwar!
Your elder brother acted smart.
Your
secret was not revealed.
Secret...
What secret?
How am I to know that?
But there's
definitely some secret.
You don't reveal
your lineage.
You can't remember your name.
You are the world's best archer
yet, you don't wield a bow!
I have learnt archery
that's why I'm good.
I don't aim
to be the best.
I'm a Brahman.
Hence I don't wield a bow.
What is the secrecy in it?
Brother Someshwar!
Why did you halt?
He says that the princess
is not married.
Hence she cannot be left
alone with you.
Hey...
Someshwar, I want to see
Vateshwar's face.
Show me his face.
Come on, quick!
Tell me your lineage.
You are to be married.
Brahman Batukeshwar
will you get us married
on the way?
The marriage will take place
in the society
in everyone's presence.
I'm just recollecting
the marital chants.
But
are these the marital chants?
Being a Brahman,
don't you know
what the marital chants are?
- Brother Someshwar
the marital chants at your
wedding were different.
Yes.
Those chants were...
What is he reciting?
Are you married to a demoness?
You made a very big mistake,
Brahman Batukeshwar.
Now, brother Someshwar is angry.
You call my wife a demoness!
No one has the courage
to marry a demoness.
Princess.
Princess, protect me.
You're right, sir.
But if you kill the demoness
brother, Hidimb
then you have to marry Hidimba.
How do you know this, princess?
The king's spies give him
all the information.
But, sir
only demons can win
against the demons, right?
Other than Lord Parashuram
and Guru Dronacharya
no ordinary Brahman
can defeat them.
This means
a...
A demon has won me?
I definitely have
been won by a demon.
Do I look as terrifying
as a demon to you?
What?
Are demons terrifying?
No, brother.
That's not what I meant.
I was just saying that
I am in a Brahman's attire.
You...
You please stop crying.
Brother Someshwar, would
sister-in-law too cry like this?
Yes, sometimes.
Now go and persuade
the princess.
How, brother?
- Apologise!
Apologise for what?
If you want to have
a peaceful married life
then keep apologising.
I am saying this
out of experience. Go.
Go.
Princess, stop crying.
Forgive me.
I lied to you.
I am not a Brahman.
I am a Kshatriya.
My name is Arjun.
And he is brother Bheem.
We have given up
our kingdom.
Hence we are disguised
as Brahmans.
I knew that.
I just wanted to
hear it from you.
Let's go.
You're not a Brahman!
You're a Kshatriya!
I had never imagined
that someone would
deceive me like this!
Leave, all of you.
Wait, sir.
At least accept the offering.
If he has renounced
all ornaments
then how can I wear them?
Give them.
It will benefit
the Brahman.
Other than those that are
the symbol of auspiciousness
give me all your ornaments.
Why did you make
me a part of this
I couldn't understand.
Brother
the minute we entered
into the 'Swayamvar
I knew
that brother Arjun
will be victorious.
Your intuition is always
true, Sahadev.
But, why aren't they
here yet?
Brother
here they are.
Greetings, brother.
Bheem
what happened?
What took you so long?
I could see
a brilliant opportunity
hence I was waiting for it.
But I couldn't get
that opportunity, brother.
What do you mean?
It was His Highness, Shakuni
who provoked all the kings
for a battle.
I thought Duryodhan
will step forward
and I'll kill him.
But they left without fighting.
Maybe they were scared.
Don't be unjust to Karna,
brother Bheem.
He doesn't possess
the trait of fear.
Brother Sumangal
why are you referring
to brother Someshwar
as Bheem?
But why are you
referring to Vateshwar
as Sumangal?
Isn't that the name you told me?
I am sure Arjun has told
Princess Draupadi
who we really are.
What you did was right, Arjun.
The one who is capable
of being a life partner
nothing should be
hidden from her.
Brother, hadn't I told you
that I had an intuition?
Welcome, princess Draupadi.
Hold on, princess.
You're not married yet.
You're the princess of Panchal.
You touching anyone's feet
is not apt.
But I have vowed to
complete this journey
with your brother.
Yet, princess
you should first seek
mother's blessings.
Parents have the right to bestow
an identity upon any relation.
Arjun
let's go.
Take princess Draupadi
and go ahead.
Mother must be waiting.
- As you say.
Mother was about
to perform some ritual.
She must be done by now.
You're welcome, Princess.
Brother Arjun!
Mother
look what I got as alms.
Look, mother
how lucky brother Arjun has
become with just the alm.
You shouldn't say that, son.
Since childhood
I have taught you
be it alms or punishment
all five brothers will always
have equal rights on it
and not just one brother.
Mother...
- It's my order, Yudhishthira
that whatever Arjun
has received
should be shared among
all you brothers.
What have you done, uncle?
What kind of a plan is this?
We had come here
to form an alliance
but have become
captives instead!
In both politics and gambling
the dice keep changing
constantly, my darlings!
According to the numbers
being rolled out
one must change one's tactics!
But how can
Jarasandha's Rajsuya 'Yajna
be of such great value, uncle?
The Pandavas.
Before the Pandavas perform
the Rajsuya 'Yajna
and become independent from
the kingdom of Hastinapur
it is important
for Jarasandha to perform
the Rajsuya 'Yajna.
We cannot attack
the city of Dwaraka
because Dwaraka
is our family now.
However
after performing
the Rajsuya 'Yajna
and declaring himself
the undefeated Emperor
of the Aryan region
if King Jarasandha
orders us to do so
then we will have to,
my darlings!
First of all
despite being guests at Dwaraka
we were insulted by Krishna
for which we must
take revenge from him!
And second
we must snatch from the Pandavas
their beloved city
of Indraprastha!
We will certainly take revenge
from the Yadavas
but
how can we have the city
of the Pandavas, uncle?
Who will fight
on behalf of Hastinapur?
The Pandavas have not yet
become
independent, my darling!
Krishna will be
pitted against Arjun
in the battle.
If that happens
then the Pandavas
will renounce their kingdom.
The annihilation of the Yadavas
and the hold over Indraprastha
will both fall into our laps.
Have you taken a look
at Jarasandha's army, uncle?
His army is a miserable one.
Jarasandha's might
has made him so arrogant
that he has not even assembled
an army of brave warriors.
Then how could he understand the
importance of a Rajsuya 'Yajna?
Shukra!
My friend
you must deliver
a message for us.
Go on, my friend.
Go on.
Where are you going
at this hour, My Lord?
The Crown Prince
is in danger, Vrushali.
I have to go to Magadha
to help him.
But you had renounced
the kingdom, My Lord.
I had renounced the kingdom
but not my friendship.
Regardless of a rider
on the back of a horse
until the reins are
present in its mouth
it cannot be truly free.
And I shall indeed
be bound by it, Vrushali.
Forever...
My friend has helped me
on numerous occasions.
Protecting him when he is in
danger is my duty.
Pardon me, My Lord!
I do not wish to come
in the way of your duty
but...
But I am exceedingly frightened!
This is the lifestyle of Kings!
They venture out every day
seeking danger.
You have taken to arms
for them today.
If need be, My Lord
will you bear a crown again
for them in the future?
Do not argue
unnecessarily, Vrushali.
This is coming in the way
of carrying out my duty.
Pardon me, My Lord!
I-I am with child!
Your child will be
born very soon.
The entire army of Hastinapur
is there to protect your friend
but the person to safeguard
me and my happiness
is only you, My Lord.
The gates will seem
like a wall to the onlookers
and the wall will seem
like the gates to them.
Areas containing water will seem
like solid ground
to the onlookers
and solid ground will seem
like areas containing water.
Such extraordinary
illusions will be
created by Mayasur for our city.
All the Kings arriving
for the Rajsuya 'Yajna
will burn with envy
upon seeing our prosperity.
What is the need for such
grandiose construction, Arjun?
Vasudev can never suggest
to construct something
that can give rise
to envy within people.
Madhav just arrived,
brother Yudhishthir.
He will explain us
what his suggestion meant.
How did Vasudev come to know
that we require his suggestion?
It is said that at the time
of his birth, Madhav
had broken his prison cell.
That is why, be it a prison
of bricks or that of a heart
Madhav always comes to know
who the prisoner is.
Punish them!
Punish them, Your Highness!
Punish them!
Punish them, Your Highness!
Punish them... - What kind
of a gamble is this, uncle?
My darling...- Punish them...
life is a game of dice
and
the person who is
acquainted with his dice
can never be defeated.
The King of Anga.
These are not arrows,
Emperor Jarasandha
but the rays
of Lord Surya himself
and no one can stop them!
If you dare
then stop them!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
That is Maharathi Karna,
Emperor Jarasandha.
In order to help his friend
he will spend his entire life
shooting at you and leaving you
incapacitated under a net!
Your arrogance will corrode.
You will be robbed
of your strength.
Even your instinct
of self-defense will cave in
but the friendship of
Maharathi Karna never will.
Emperor, your might
and the competence
of Crown Prince Duryodhan
are differentiated
solely by this.
Competence is something
that creates something new
while might is something
that breaks someone's creation.
Both are essential
but the importance
of competence is way higher.
Now that you are going to
perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna
it is essential
for all the Kings
of the Aryan region
to acknowledge your competence.
That is why
I had suggested you to create
such a grandiose structure.
But Vasudev
the people who see
such a grandiose structure
will certainly
be filled with envy.
Upon seeing any great structure
the subjects of that kingdom
are filled with pride.
When prosperity is apparent
in order to make the kingdom
more prosperous, the subjects
are always prepared.
The competence of a King
lies neither in his army
nor in the strength of his
allies and his sense of control.
The competence of a King
lies in the sense of pride his
subjects have for the kingdom
in the faith of his friends
and in the envy of his enemies.
The competence of a King
lies in his army
in his allies
and in his sense of control.
You have had the entire
Aryan region terrorized
but where is your
sense of control?
Who is the person
who makes certain
that even in far-off places
your orders are
obeyed by people?
That is why
Emperor Jarasandha
you have not yet been
able to kill Vasudev Krishna.
Who is the person who makes certain
that even in far-off places
your orders are
obeyed by people?
That is why
Emperor Jarasandha
you have not yet been
able to kill Vasudev Krishna.
The killing of Jarasandha
will be a demonstration
of your might
and the construction
of a grandiose court
will be a symbol
of your competence.
When you shall accomplish
both these tasks
all the Kings
of the Aryan region
will deem you
the undefeated Emperor.
But without the order
from Hastinapur
we cannot attack Magadha.
We have heard that
the King of Gandhar Shakuni
and Duryodhan have
gone to Magadha
with the proposal
to form an alliance.
But they can form an alliance
only when grandsire
will go to Magadha himself
approach Jarasandha and accept
a lower position in his court.
But brother Yudhishthir
in exchange of accepting
that lower position
when the Kuru flag will be
hoisted on the palace of Magadha
grandsire will
indeed be pleased.
If you allow us then before
we become independent
we shall annex
Magadha to Hastinapur.
Just give us the order
to attack, brother Yudhishthir.
I am getting restless
to put an end to Jarasandha.
People who can make
everyone obey your orders
are warriors
like Maharathi Karna
and you require such people!
He can go to far-off places
and make people
obey yours orders.
That is why
you must become
the undefeated Emperor.
Only then,
Emperor Jarasandha
will you be able to kill
Vasudev Krishna
and annihilate the Yadavas
while we will be able
to take over Indraprastha
and annihilate the Pandavas.
This is the labyrinth
of politics
Emperor Jarasandha
and no one can
navigate through it.
You truly are
very intelligent,
King of Gandhar
Shakuni.
Conducting the Rajsuya 'Yajna
will be my first step
to attacking Dwaraka
for this is undoubtedly
a splendid opportunity.
100 Kings who are
allies to the Yadavas
will be killed by me first
in order to perform the Narmedha 'Yajna.'*
*Self sacrificing.
And in place of
the 101st sacrifice
will be Vasudev Krishna!
Brother Yudhisthir
your army shall indeed
be victorious.
Putting Jarasandha to an end
will be the beginning
of your Rajsuya 'Yajna.
Tell the Princess of Yadava,
Subhadra
that Prince Arjun
wishes to meet her.
As you say, Prince.
Greetings, Princess of Yadava.
Prince Arjun is here.
Prince Arjun!
Handmaidens, take these away.
And you, prepare the seat.
Tell him to enter!
Wait!
Tell him to enter after a while.
As you say, Princess.
Greetings, son of Pandu!
- Greetings.
Welcome!
Wait...
Walk carefully. I have placed
those clothes there to be dried
because I am to leave
for Dwaraka.
Walk carefully.
Careful!
Now, move forth.
You too are a very
graceful dancer, son of Pandu.
Are you contented now
by making me dance?
I am quite contented!
Did your brother Krishna teach
you to exact revenge like so?
My brother never takes revenge.
When your uncle Kansa
had abducted your parents
then in order to
exact revenge from him
your brother Krishna
had slain him.
And you say that your brother
Krishna does not exact revenge?
He did not exact revenge.
My brother Krishna says
that justice makes
the world go round.
If the culprit isn't punished
then the world will lose
its state of balance.
I don't get it.
Neither do I.
I never understand
any of the things he does.
Peculiar are the things
Krishna does.
He compels one
to meditate over things.
I have come to you
to learn more about him.
So, you've come to me
to learn about him?
Tell me something.
By submitting to Jarasandha
why did your brother Krishna
leave from Mathura?
And when Jarasandha
attacked Dwaraka
your brother defeated him.
He could have done so
in Mathura, couldn't he?
I don't know.
Son of Pandu
I hope you will invite me
to your wedding.
First, brother Yudhishthir and
brother Bheem will get married.
My marriage is
out of the question.
Tell me something...
- I don't know.
You can learn about my brother
by talking to him yourself
when you meet him.
You should leave.
I have to get ready
for the journey.
Handmaiden, pick up the clothes.
But first, answer my question.
I don't know.
You should leave.
Subhadra.
Subhadra.
Greetings, mother.
- Greetings.
Subhadra, I just got the news
that the path leading
to Dwaraka from here
has been obstructed by
Demon Kalyavan and his army.
Travelling by that path
is not safe.
Subhadra.
Dear, why are you so scared?
I will send Arjun with you
to protect you.
Now, stop crying-
Arjun
take Subhadra to Dwaraka
safely.
But mother
is it right to leave
Hastinapur now?
Certainly.
There is no question of
a struggle now, Arjun.
Duryodhan has
accepted Yudhishthir
as the Crowned Prince
whole-heartedly.
Righteousness dwells
in his heart.
You can be worry-free and
take Subhadra to Dwaraka.
Get ready to leave
tomorrow at dawn.
Certainly, mother.
Hastinapur.
A Few Days Later.
We need to let our horses
rest here for a while.
You should freshen up
and have your meal.
Are you certain
Kalyavan is not here?
Are you still scared
despite me being with you?
No...
My brother says that
Kalyavan is very powerful
and that no weapon can kill him.
He is ghostly white
and has yellow hair!
He seems exceedingly scary.
Your brother Krishna comes up
with the most fascinating tales!
I shall not tolerate
my brother's insult!
Hey, where are you going?
I do not require your help.
I can reach Dwaraka
with my handmaidens.
Let's go.
I do not wish to rest here.
You won't reach
Dwaraka this way.
You will have to come back!
And what if you
come across Kalyavan?
Arjun!
What happened?
Did you come across Kalyavan?
Arjun!
Subhadra!
Subhadra!
Subhadra!
Arjun!
Are you Krishna?
- I am your doom, Kalyavan.
If you are not Krishna
then you are of no use to me
because Jarasandha had said
that if I abduct
Krishna's sister
then Krishna will certainly
come to protect his sister.
And if you are Krishna
then protect her.
Protect her!
Are you alright?
Arjun!
Brother!
Brother Krishna save me!
Save me from this demon!
Brother Krishna!
- Brother Krishna!
Brother Krishna!
Come here
and save
your sister from this demon!
What do you think?
That your brother
can come here and save you?
Hey, Vasudeva!
You shepherd!
By slaying the demon Shankhasura
you seem to be flying too high!
You think you are
a better warrior than me
and Jarasandha,
the King of Magadha!
Then come here
and save your sister!
Come here!
Show yourself, coward!
Show yourself now!
Indeed, Drona!
Him!
Your disciple
Arjun.
But unfortunately
he died in Varnavrat.
This is what I have heard.
The Pandavas are
my disciples, Drupad.
They have the
capability of escaping
even the fire of a volcano.
Then how can a small
palace fire hurt them?
If they are alive then why
do they not show themselves?
Where are they?
In order to participate
in Draupadi's 'swayamvar
if I have to send the invites
then where should I send them?
Fate does not require
an invitation, King Drupad.
Go ahead and conduct
the'swayamvar.
Hold such a
difficult competition
that can be won only by
the best archer of the world.
If it is in the fate
of the Aryan region
then Arjun will be sent here
by the Almighty himself.
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
- All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
Apart from that giant man
all of you may devour
the rest of the humans.
Stop...
Stop!
Hidimb
I beg of you.
Do not sacrifice them.
I beg of you!
Be quiet, Hidimba.
Be quiet!
Ogres
my beloved sister
has fallen in love with
that giant and inferior man.
She has forgotten..
She has forgotten
that she is an ogre!
And the arch-enemies of us ogres
are these humans.
She has forgotten
our Lord Vrikodar!
Hidimba
do not talk like a fool.
By sacrificing these
inferior humans today
we will please
our Lord Vrikodar!
Move forth!
Stop!
King Hidimb, how can they
have a meal before you?
W-Why not?
A-All of us always
dine together.
Sahadev.
Y-Yes.
It is a sin.
Yes, it is an insult
to the King.
Ask our eldest brother
if you like.
He never lies.
Brother, is it not a sin?
A sin..
No.
It is not a sin..
- It may not be a sin
but it is tradition.
The King ought to
have his meal first.
It is tradition.
And amongst us, you like
brother Bheem most of all.
So, brother Bheem..
No!
Before you engage
in a duel with him
you will have to kill me.
Hidimba, do not worry.
I do not require the
protection of a woman.
Go ahead, King Hidimb.
No!
No, Hidimb. Listen to me.
Do not kill him!
Listen to me..
Brother Bheem, go on.
The King awaits
to make you his meal.
Arjun..
Sons, all of you
should also aid Bheem.
Do not worry, mother.
Go ahead, King Hidimb.
I await to become your meal.
Stop!
Only I will fight
this giant man.
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
- All hail Lord Vrikodar!
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
- All hail Lord Vrikodar!
Is Vrikodar
not your name, Bheem?
King Hidimb deems you a God.
Now, go ahead and
offer him some sacrament.
As you say, brother.
Who is Arjun, Govind?
Arjun?
Thank you!
Arjun
is a Prince of Hastinapur.
His father, King Pandu
had renounced the kingdom
and his elder brother,
King Dhritarashtra
had been appointed
the interim King.
And now, Dhritarashtra's
son Duryodhan also
wants to become King.
But ascension to the throne
should be based on competence
and not on desire.
With regard to this
the throne of Hastinapur
rightfully belongs
to the eldest son of King Pandu
Yudhishthir.
And when Yudhishthir was
declared the Crown Prince
surrounded by anger,
envy and dejection
Duryodhan sent the five brothers
to a palace and burnt them.
This is what people say.
Since then there is no news
of the five brothers.
Maybe because of the animosity
their brothers have with them
they may have decided
to stay hidden.
Who can know?
In other words,
if these rumours are true
then the Pandavas let
injustice happen to them?
They did not even protest
and you call them powerful?
Protest is not a proof
of power, Draupadi.
Powerful are those
who tolerate
and the ones who can do so.
But what about justice, Govind?
How can you deem tolerating
injustice to be a power?
When the heart gets expunged
of protest and anger
tolerance becomes the
strength of righteousness.
From anger stems revenge
but from righteousness..
From righteousness
stems justice, Draupadi.
Draupadi
in your life as well
when you meet
with some form of injustice
before you resort to justice
you must curtail your anger.
More?
We shall not be
able to eat more.
We are no longer hungry.
How can you say that we are not
hungry without asking me first?!
You know quite well that I
feel hungrier after a fight!
And this measly amount of fruits
will not suffice me. Bring more.
You need not go.
I shall go bring some.
Do continue eating,
Your Highness.
Your Highness!
King Vrikodar is
getting angry, Nakul.
Apologize!
Pardon me, King Vrikodar.
I beg of you.
Please pardon me.
Fool! You have
committed a crime.
You shall be punished.
You shall be married to an ogre.
Sahadev, Nakul, Arjun
be quiet.
And what is with this
King Vrikodar rant?
Let me eat in peace.
Sure, why not.
Go ahead.
You will now eat in peace
your entire life.
B-But
please do not eat us.
All of us are your brothers,
King Vrikodar.
What are all of you saying?
Brother Bheem
were you not paying attention
when Hidimb's sister
had said all this?
It is the tradition of the ogres
that whoever kills the King
becomes the next King.
In other words, you are now King
of the Ogre region.
Are they telling the truth,
brother Yudhishthir?
Yes, Bheem.
Hidimba did tell us so.
Brother Yudhishthir
will brother Bheem have to
marry an ogre now?
Indeed, brother Arjun.
Sahadev, did you not
have any premonition?
This is an auspicious sign
and I hear jubilation.
And I see brother Bheem
being dressed like ogres.
Could you not
tell me this before?
When Hidimba said
that she would show us
the way out of here
then why did all of you
bring me here?
That is because, brother Bheem
if you had left this forest
then Hidimba's heart
would have been broken.
What do you mean?
The Lord has ordered
you to get married
tomorrow at dawn
to Princess Hidimha.
So, this is
the new-born.
It is time
to sacrifice him, Devaki.
No, brother!
What crime did this
boy child commit?
It has committed
the crime of being born!
Your child is my doom.
Him being born
is a crime, Devaki.
But our first child
will not kill you.
Our eighth child
is meant to slay you.
This is what the voice
from the sky had said.
Every fruit of a poisonous tree
is poisonous, Vasudev.
I will not spare
a single child of yours.
Along with Mathura,
the entire nation should know
that if a person even
dreams of revolting against me
then he will die
right after his birth!
Devaki
give me your child.
Give him to me!
No, brother!
I will not give my son to you!
What is his crime?
- Let me go!
He is soft and fragile.
- Let me go!
If you see his face,
your heart will melt.
Just look at him,
brother.
Just look at his face.
- Foolish Devaki!
Even a lion cub
is defenseless and fragile
like a kitten!
But when it grows up, it becomes
the King of the Jungle!
That is why, I will not let
any of your children live.
No!
Give me your child!
Give him to me!
Give him!
No, brother!
- No, Kansa!
No!
Brother,
let my child go.
My Lord...
You are my doom?
- No!
No! - Take my life instead
but please let him live!
Let him go,
brother!
Will you kill me?
My Lord...
Let me go...
- My Lord...
My Lord...
- No...
Kansa!
If you kill him
then do remember!
We will sacrifice
seven children of ours
even if it kills our souls!
But our eighth son meant
to slay you will indeed be born!
If you have the competence
then go ahead
and kill him as well!
No, brother!
- No...
No, Kansa.
No!
Uncle
were all the children
born before you
killed by King Kansa of Mathura?
Yes, dear.
Both sins and merits
are like a pearl necklace.
The way the first pearl
attracts the second
and the second
attracts the third
similarly
one good deed leads to another
while one sin leads to another.
Sin fuels the arrogance
of a person.
A person can stop himself
from committing another sin
only when he sees the grave
consequence of that sin.
But a person
blinded by arrogance
is unable to see
that consequence.
The tradition of
unrighteousness and crime
keeps getting augmented by him.
The number of treacherous
and deceitful acts
and crimes
a society can tolerate
and the number of crimes
it can pardon
is decided
by the society itself.
In a society, the one who has
the power to punish the wrong
needs to take that decision.
But uncle,
how were Mother Devaki
and grandsire Vasudev
able to make so many sacrifices?
Did their hearts not break
when a new-born child
was sacrificed each time?
Dear Prativindhya
after the death
of their first son
mother Devaki and father Vasudev
were robbed
of their happiness for life.
The truth is
those children
were not sacrificed, dear.
In that war against
unrighteousness
they were the brave martyrs.
The happiness
of my parents
had been sacrificed.
But why did they have to make
such a grave sacrifice, uncle?
Dear Srutakarman
do you know what is the limit
of the sacrifices for the people
trying to establish
righteousness?
The limit of the sins
of the sinners
is the limit
of their sacrifices.
In other words
until the sinners and their sins
get annihilated
the sacrifices
to be made by the righteous
cannot come to an end.
Am I correct,
friend?
Dhundhumali
please tell my sons now
how my brother Shri Krishna
was able to survive.
In this manner,
the wicked Kansa
killed all the children
of Devaki and Vasudev.
It was then the time
for the eighth son to be born.
My Lord...
My Lord,
are these thunders
a sign...
A sign of death
of our eighth son?
I am exceedingly frightened,
My Lord.
Each time a child
of mine was killed
I too died along with them,
My Lord.
But I remembered,
My Lord
that giving birth
to our eighth son
is my duty.
That is why...
That is why,
I am alive until now.
If brother
kills our eighth son
before our eyes
then I will not be able to live!
I will not be able to live!
If that happens,
Devaki
then I too shall embrace death.
But I have firm faith,
Devaki
that in order to salvage
the entire world
our eighth son
will indeed be born.
And this time, Kansa will
not be able to kill him.
The power to thwart
the wish of the Almighty
does not reside in Kansa.
Guard!
What is this
sinister environment?
What is this illusion?
Guard!
Guard!
Greetings,
Your Highness.
Go to the prison
and examine the situation.
The moment you hear the cry
of Devaki's eighth son
inform me at once!
If you delay even by a moment
then the way a potter
removes a pot from the wheel
I shall have you beheaded!
Go! - As you say,
Your Highness.
Tonight
Devaki's eighth son
will indeed be born.
My Lord!
Do not be frightened
Vasudev, the eldest
of the Yadavas.
Devaki,
the daughter of Devak
bless you!
When Hiranyaksh had submerged
the earth in the cosmic ocean
I had assumed the Varaha Avatar
and salvaged the earth.
In my Narasimha Avatar
I had slain Hiranyakashipu.
In my Vaman Avatar
I had established King Bali
in the netherworld.
Each time human beings
forget the essence
of righteousness
each time their hearts
are robbed of virtues
when competition
takes the place of love
and arrogance
takes the place of kindness
and a King begins to exploit
his own subjects
and begins to covet
polity and power
more than the truth
I am born on this earth.
Today,
once again
I must assume
another avatar of mine.
The two of you
have made numerous sacrifices
in the name of righteousness.
Upon seeing your agony
even the Gods in the heavens
are overwhelmed with sorrow.
But through your medium
the world
will receive
righteousness and peace
as sacraments.
I will be born as your son
and play in your lap,
mother.
In this auspicious hour
I shall enter your womb
with all my skills and powers.
I, Vishnu,
bless the entire world
but now, I seek your blessings
for this endeavour.
Do accept me
as your son, mother.
That sounded like the scream
of your eldest brother, My Lord.
That is impossible.
What danger can befall him while
performing the 'Sandhyavandana?
Maybe a crocodile bit him
or maybe a Yaksha or an ogre
has captured him.
Please go and have
a look, My Lord.
I cannot leave you here
and go, Panchali.
That is the second time he has
screamed for help, My Lord.
Please go and have a look!
You will return soon anyhow.
What can happen in the meantime?
Please go,
My Lord!
But Panchali
today is the last day
of our exile.
Duryodhan must certainly
be up to no good.
That is what we fear.
He must have attacked
My Lord Yudhishthir
finding him by himself.
Please go and have
a look, My Lord!
Until My Lords Bheem
and Sahadev return
I shall protect myself
with this sword, My Lord.
Please go and have a look.
Daughter of Drupad...
Who are you
and why have you come
to my residence?
Me?
I am King Jayadrath of Sindhu
and Dushala's husband.
King of Sindhu!
Greetings!
Welcome!
Pardon me...
- What?
My Lord Yudhishthir has gone
to perform the 'Sandhyavandana.
I know that.
I
saw everything
while hiding there
and the moment he left
I came here.
Brother Yudhishthir!
Brother Yudhishthir!
Brother Yudhishthir!
Brother Yudhishthir!
Nakul! What are you
doing here?
I heard your scream.
You were screaming for help.
I was performing 'pranayam'* under the water.
*Extension of the praa or breath.
This is certainly a part
of a wicked plan, brother.
Panchali...
Panchali is by herself
in the hut, brother Yudhishthir!
Let's go there immediately!
What is this villainy,
King of Sindhu?!
I have come to take you away.
You have already
served five husbands.
Now,
how about
you serve me for a while?
Let me go,
wicked man!
Let's go!
- Let go!
Brother Bheem
I have a feeling that something
bad will happen with Panchali.
We must return
immediately, brother.
Let go!
My Lord!
My Lord!
My Lord!
Let go...
My Lord!
- Panchali!
My Lord!
- Panchali!
Let go.
My Lord!
- Stop, King of Sindhu!
My Lord!
Panchali!
- My Lord!
Bheem!
It was Dushala's husband,
brother Yudhishthir!
He has abducted Panchali.
He must certainly be trying
to go to the kingdom of Sindhu.
We must stop him
before he crosses the border!
It is not dusk yet,
uncle.
Even the Pandavas have
not yet reached, my darling.
Look over there.
King of Sindhu is on his way.
Do not worry,
my darling.
No one can stop the sun.
Let go!
Let go!
Arjun!
- My darling
none of us can attack him.
If we break our promise
then that old geyser
will not get off our case.
Wait until it is sundown.
No one shall attack
until sundown.
How dare you lay even
a finger on Draupadi
King Jayadrath of Sindhu?!
How could you even dream
of defeating
the sons of Pandu?!
How could you even think
that your act of trying
to abduct Panchali
would go unpunished by me?!
Here you go!
Here I am!
And when I stand tall
like a wall
Pavan Dev himself
is unable to go through me!
You are a mere mortal!
We cannot attack him,
uncle
but we can certainly
protect our brother-in-law.
Attack!
Stop!
Where is the King of Sindhu?!
Where did Arjun and Draupadi
disappear?!
We must find them before dusk!
Where did the three
of them disappear?
Where did the three
of them disappear?!
King of Sindhu!
You must be aware of
the punishment awarded
to a person who tries to
abduct a married woman!
Pardon me
but we must slay you!
Then you must
also slay Duryodhan.
I did this because
he asked me to.
Does a piece of wood
thrown into the fire
by someone else not burn,
King of Sindhu?!
Bheem!
Kill King of Sindhu!
All of them must certainly
be present in these woods!
Soldiers!
Jayadrath,
I shall crush your head!
Punish him,
My Lord!
Punish him in a way
that whenever any evil man
looks at a woman with depravity
fear should take him over!
No, brother Bheem!
He is Dushala's husband.
We cannot leave
our sister widowed.
Do not take pity on him,
brother Arjun!
Whoever tries to save a scorpion
from drowning in the water
gets stung by
the scorpion itself.
I hope you know that.
This man will hurt you someday!
We will deal
with it later, Nakul
but
we cannot leave
our sister widowed.
Brother!
I have found the crown
of the King of Sindhu.
They must certainly have
gone in that direction.
It is almost sundown.
Do what you have to
but with haste.
We must punish him
so that even Duryodhan
learns a lesson!
Arjun!
Bring your arrow!
I shall shave his head!
These are five tufts of hair,
King of Sindhu!
Show them to Duryodhan and tell
him that even the five Pandavas
will always be present
on his head
like five lines of tension!
Brothers.
How could they escape
in just a moment?
How could they just vanish?!
The question is not
how they left.
The question is
where they went.
My darling
before a year is over
we must find the Pandavas.
Please be quiet,
uncle.
Your plan
has failed once again.
My plan has not failed,
my darling.
Good fortune was on
the side of the Pandavas
Yet again.
Fortune!
What is fortune,
uncle?!
Good fortune of the enemies
is merely another term
for our weakness.
Karna was correct.
Treachery can be useful
only in winning a game of dice
and not an empire!
Do not forget,
my darling
that for the past twelve years
the glory of being the Emperor
was not acquired by you
in a battlefield.
Treachery
and cheating have
gifted you that.
The competence
to fight the Pandavas
does not reside
within you.
I do not have the competence!
Is Bheem more powerful than me?
When compared to
my friend Karna, is Arjun
a better archer,
uncle?
The individual competence
of each one of you
is something I am not aware of.
However,
in a battle
the basis of victory
is not individual might
but the might of the army.
The number of Kings
on your side in a battle
is more important.
The love the subjects
have for you
is more important.
The blossoming
of a single flower
does not denote
the arrival of spring.
When the entire forest
is filled with flowers
it is spring time then.
Similarly
an empire
is formed with the affection
and trust of all the Kings.
Uncle
your words can
no longer be trusted by me.
My heart desires blood now.
I want a war now!
I want a war now.
- You want a war!
You want a war?!
There will be a war!
Before a year is over
if we do not find the Pandavas
if you
do not see any one of them
and call him by his name
and if their life of anonymity
cannot be rendered
worthless by us
then there will be war.
Lord...
Don't say anything
instead, just hear
me out, Gandhari.
Emotions are really peculiar.
They flow like water and then
cannot stop, just like
the flow of water.
In the same way, my
heart kept running
on the paths of hatred,
sorrow, anger and sadness.
It kept stumbling.
The way a dam stops
water from flowing
in the same way,
one's thought process
can be stopped due to
a single incident.
When there was no news of
Pandu from the battlefield
my thought process stopped
as is due to a dam.
The negative thoughts stopped.
My worry for Pandu
stopped my mind from travelling
the path of hatred and anger.
I understood that
I was unfortunate
and no one has
conspired against me.
I was unjust with
Pandu, Gandhari.
When I understood that,
I realized
that I was unjust to you too.
I had rejected you, Gandhari.
If I realize my mistake
would you accept me?
My heart is overflowing
with happiness today.
Now that I have shown
my weaknesses to you
I feel relived.
So what if I couldn't
become the king?
Here, I am respected and
honoured more than a king.
When you gift me with
a son in the future
he will be the eldest in the
next generation of the Kurus.
He will become the king.
He will become the heir to
the throne after Pandu.
I will feel like I was
enthroned, Gandhari.
Will you gift me with
such an able son?
Yes, Lord.
To fulfil your wishes
I can even go
to the God of death.
When it's time
we will together go to
the God of death, Gandhari.
We still have to lead
a happy life, don't we?
Stop!
Lord, look at that.
It's such a beautiful animal.
It's absolutely unusual.
Please bring me its skin
for my throne.
No! We cannot kill a deer
for no reason.
If the deer has fawns
they may turn into orphans.
Its usual for fawns
to turn into orphans.
What's so unusual
about it, Lord?
I want the animal.
Lord, wouldn't you fulfil
your wife's simple wish?
I'm not asking you
to crown me the queen.
I'm just asking for a deer.
Madri, you should open your
mouth to speak good things
not bitter things.
I will bring the deer for you.
All of you, wait here.
Madri.
To kill an animal for no reason
isn't right.
Kshatriyas are used
to killing animals.
But you may not understand that.
Weren't you born into
the Yadav clan, sister?
And the Yadavs are
shepherds, aren't they?
No!
No!
Sage Kindam! Was that you?
Had you taken
the form of a deer?
What have you done?
You shot the arrow
without recognizing me.
I was dallying with my wife
in the form of a deer.
Fool!
In spite of seeing the deer's
appearance and grace
didn't you realize that it was
an unusual deer?
Please forgive me, sage.
I have made
a grave mistake.
It isn't a mistake but a crime!
Imbecile! How could you
forget Dasharath's* fate?
*Father of Rama who killed a boy, mistaking him to be a deer, and cursed by the boy's blind parents.
Did you forget
that he had made
the same mistake?
He had to repent
for it all his life.
What kind of
a human being are you?
What kind of a king are you?
How will a cruel king like you
bring welfare to his subjects?
You too have to
suffer a punishment.
You have disturbed the intimacy
between a man and his wife.
I curse you!
If you cohabit with a woman...
If you establish a conjugal
relationship with her
you will be dead!
"Greetings!"
"I greet the King!"
"May there be happiness"
"with the queen mother,
Bhishma and the ministers!"
"Greetings!"
"Dhundhumali the imbecile has
many doubts in his heart."
"The doubts dance on
my head like spirits."
"Dhundhumali, what is
your question? Ask us."
"Should I?
Answer this."
"He is the master
and also the slave."
"He rests and also travels."
"He is freedom
and restriction too."
"All are fascinated by him."
"Tell me. Who is it?"
"Come on, tell me.
- Life!"
"There is no rest in life.
- A wife!"
"There is no freedom
from a wife."
"A son."
"Perfect!
Well done, sire."
"Now, the second question."
"What is superior to knowledge?
It is always constant."
"The experts surrender
before it."
"All the pleasures
accumulated together."
"Come on, tell me.
Speak up!"
"What is it?"
"Devotion."
"Experience."
"Foolishness."
"No!"
" Love . "
"Wonderful!
That was perfect, sire!"
"And now, the third question."
"A forehead like the sun,
his shoulders broad enough"
"he has strong insights"
"he is an epitome
of righteousness."
"Tell me."
"Come on, tell me.
Who is it?"
"My elder brother,
prince Dhritarashtra!"
"Perfect, minister."
"And now, the last question."
"The one who answers it,
will be proven intelligent."
"In the four answers"
"lies some good news."
"If you answer the question,
I would agree"
"this a court of brilliant men."
"What happened, Vidur?"
"What is the clown saying?"
"Brother"
"I have three answers."
"Son, love and
prince Dhritarashtra!"
"It means, he is trying to say"
"that you will achieve the love
of a son very soon, brother!"
The king has arrived on
a very auspicious occasion.
Greetings, Queen Mother.
Welcome, Pandu.
Look at the games
played by time.
To be a part of a happy
event in our family
you have returned before time.
Gandhari is expecting.
Dhritarashtra's first son
will be born very soon.
I curse you!
If you establish a conjugal
relationship with a woman
you will be dead!
Pandu
I hope you have understood
the news.
You don't look pleased at all.
Yes, Queen Mother.
Just like grief, happiness
also stops the brain
from functioning at times.
Brother, I am
extremely happy.
Brother, my hearty
congratulations to you!
What kind of a king are you?
How will a cruel king like you
bring welfare to his subjects?
Queen Mother, I have to announce
something important.
I killed sage Kindam
in the forest!
I am no longer worthy of
ruling a kingdom, Queen Mother.
I have killed sage Kindam!
I am no longer worthy of
ruling a kingdom, Queen Mother.
So, I have decided
that from this very moment
I renounce the throne
of Hastinapur!
Greetings, uncle.
- May you live long.
Lord Vishnu
made eight elephants stand
facing the eight directions
and gave them the responsibility
of all the three realms
the sky, the earth
and the heavens.
I hope you know that.
It was a very honourable
thing for them.
And they are restricted
by the same.
Pandu, think about this.
If one of the eight elephants
filled with grief and remorse,
like you
decides to withdraw from his
responsibilities
what would happen?
The entire creation would
be destroyed.
No, uncle.
Lord Vishnu will appoint some
other animal to bear the burden
of the three worlds.
The universe cannot be destroyed
because of one entity
and neither would the
kingdom of Hastinapur
be destroyed if I left.
Hastinapur will
not be destroyed.
But the happiness
of your Queen Mother
and your uncle's peace would
surely be destroyed, dear.
The Queen Mother has waited
for 25 years.
It's her right to see
a worthy king seated
on the throne of Hastinapur.
But, uncle. I am no
longer worthy.
I am no longer worthy.
I have committed
a grave sin, uncle.
Kripacharya and Vidur have
given you a remedy to it.
Donate cows,
offer prayers.
You should fast and abstain.
Uncle, that would be deceit.
It would be like
deceiving myself.
When Lord Indra killed a sage
he had renounced his kingdom.
He had renounced heaven.
He had meditated for several
years on a lotus stem.
When the King of Gods couldn't
wash his sins away so easily...
I am a mere human being.
How would my sins
be washed away
through charity and abstinence?
But, dear...
- Don't stop me, uncle.
The one who holds the sceptre
is called the king.
To give justice to everyone
and do justice with everyone
is the duty of a king, uncle.
If a king commits a crime
who will mete out
his punishment, uncle?
In order to
prove himself as the most
powerful man in Aryavart
this deceptive Krishna
has conspired.
Couldn't the greatest
of the great warriors
Bhishma be honoured?
Then why was Krishna
honoured?
Sishupal
I have no objections with
Vasudeva being felicitated.
Then why are you arguing
for no reason?
Why would you have
a problem, Bhishma?
After all, you are incompetent.
You have gone to
the extent of stealing girls
for your Princes.
Sishupala
are you keeping a count
of your sins?
Only 100!
I will forgive only
100 of your sins
as promised to your mother.
And before you came here
you have committed many sins.
Keep quiet, wicked man.
You're a lewd man
who marries
the wives of other men.
You married 16,000
of Narkasur's wives.
Everybody here knows
about your lewdness.
At Brindavan, you would
stand on one leg
and play the flute and perform
the dance of divine love.
We are all aware of that!
Radha was married
to Ayan Yadav.
Yet you trapped that
innocent girl
in your endearing
infatuation.
Has it slipped your mind?
Have you forgotten?
You are the world's most
immoral being, Krishna.
Quieten down, Sishupla.
Don't walk so blindly on
this sinful path
that you're unable to keep
count of those sins.
I am well aware of what
I'm doing, Krishna.
And I also know why
you're being honoured.
This is another evidence
of your lewdness.
Definitely, Draupadi
must have told her
incapable husbands
that you should be given
the greatest of honours.
You call her your friend,
don't you?
Friend!
How can a married woman
be friends with a man?
All of us know what relationship
you and...
It's time for you
to quieten down, Sishupal.
May your soul
rest in peace.
What sordid justice is
this, brother Yudhishthir?
How can killing a guest
like this
be considered appropriate?
After becoming
the mighty sovereign
is this how you're going
to establish righteousness
in the whole of Aryavart?
Calm down, Duryodhan.
Sishupal insulted grandsire
Vasudeva
and my father.
He disrespected my authority.
He also insulted daughter-in-law
of the Kuru dynasty, Rukmini
and also queen Draupadi.
He got the punishment
he deserved.
Yudhishthir
punishment can never
exceed the crime.
The punishment must always
be lesser than the crime.
You can humiliate someone
as a punishment for an insult.
How can you kill him?
Sin and crime are part of
a poisonous cycle, Prince.
If the criminal is not stopped
from committing a crime
he will go on to commit
many crimes.
He goes on to pollute his soul.
He loses control over himself.
He continues to
commit crimes
even without reason.
The way
an infant is forcefully stopped
from consuming sand
in the same manner
it is necessary
to stop a criminal
from committing crimes.
That's not a punishment, Prince.
It's sympathy!
Don't unnecessarily worry
about Sishupal.
He has been freed
from this poisonous cycle.
Don't try to fool me,
Vasudeva Krishna.
You have taken revenge in
the name of punishment.
You have violated
this yajna.
My dear
Vasudeva is right.
Be seated.
- Keep quiet, uncle.
Prince Sishupal was my friend.
We had sworn to
protect each other.
If I don't avenge
his death today
then my being
a warrior
will be questioned, uncle.
Vasudeva Krishna
I challenge you to a duel.
My dear, Vasudeva is right.
Be seated.
Please be seated...
Brother Duryodhan,
don't degrade the sanctity
of Indraprastha
by shedding your blood.
I don't forgive anyone
who dares to raise
a weapon against Madhav.
Brother Arjun...
If this is the beginning
of the battle
then I accept it.
Prince Duryodhan...
Before fighting the battle,
it is mandatory
to take the permission
of the King of Hastinapur,
Dhritarashtra.
But the king of Hastinapur
isn't present here, Minister.
The minister of Hastinapur
is present though!
You can indeed call for
a verbal duel with Vasudev.
But you can't use weapons
in somebody else's court.
I order you
to either put down
your weapon
or step down from
the post of Hastinapur's prince.
Else, I'll have to give orders
to Hastinapur's
Army General, Bhishm
to raise weapons
for protecting Indraprastha.
Brother Duryodhan
I request you
to put your weapons down.
My child...
My child...
Don't be foolish.
Destiny defeats the one
who has no control
over one's anger
even before anyone else
defeats them.
Drop your weapons.
This is not enough.
Your Highness
the one who has raised weapons
in your court
should certainly be punished.
To strengthen the confidence
of all the kings present here
on your just nature,
it's compulsory
that Prince Duryodhan
be punished.
I forgive brother Duryodhan.
Your Highness, punish him!
Yes, punish him!
Your Highness, punish him!
Yes, punish him!
Your Highness, punish him!
Yes, punish him!
Your Highness,
those who spit at the sky
make their own face dirty.
The sky doesn't forgive
but punishes them.
Similarly
you can't forgive
Prince Duryodhan
for his mistake.
Even Arjun
was punished, brother.
Whereas he had only tried
to protect the honour
of Panchali.
But how should I punish him?
Duryodhan is my brother.
By punishing him, I can't
hurt uncle.
Your Highness...
Destiny paves its own path.
Don't worry.
Just decide on the punishment.
Your Highness...
Shall I say something?
I don't see any reason
why we should hurt uncle
and her highness, by punishing
brother-in-law Duryodhan.
But Govind is insisting
on giving him punishment.
Then, Your Highness
it's considered
punishment enough
to sieze the weapons
of a warrior.
Order brother-in-law Duryodhan
to give up his weapon.
Order brother-in-law Duryodhan
to give up his weapon.
With due respect
we'll send his weapon
to Hastinapur.
How dare you decide
punishment for me
Draupadi!
Don't try to humiliate me!
Don't take it as humiliation,
brother-in-law.
This is a solution to the conflict
that has arisen in the family.
And it's an attempt to eliminate
the taint that was tossed
on your clothes
as well as your heart.
You possess a tainted character
yourself
and you worry about
my clothes?
Control your tongue, Duryodhan!
Brother Duryodhan,
it's my order
that within the boundaries
of Indraprastha
you're not allowed
to hold your weapon.
Bheem, Arjun, Sahdev
seize the weapons
from brother Duryodhan
brother Dushasan
and from the King of Anga.
Prince Duryodhan,
hand over your weapons.
This is my order.
Your Highness, the punishment
for raising weapons
in the court is death.
Grant me
the same punishment.
Whether or not
there's blood shed
how does it make a difference,
King of Anga?
Consider this to be equivalent
to death penalty.
Come on, hand over
your bow to me.
I give my word!
Fall to the feet of Draupadi
and beg for forgiveness
and the Pandavas shall consider
even that as a penance.
Could you do so much, Prince?
Pardon me, Krishna!
Crime, forgiveness,
punishment, war...
All these talks are futile.
If you indeed wish to avoid
this great battle
put forth a proposal
that seems reasonable.
But can you make your friend
comply to it, King of Anga?
I can request my friend.
I cannot order him.
When a dog riding an elephant
barks at the king of the forest
the elephant is the one
who is blamed
for supporting the dog
with its capability.
In fact, it is your ability
that is the base of
the Prince's tyranny.
It is my suggestion to you
that you give up your alliance
to the Prince.
Only that shall make up
for your sins
and grant a new leash of life
to your friend.
I have faith in your virtue.
And my faith is
my virtue, Krishna.
Rather than betraying my friend
I would choose to die.
I respect you, King of Anga!
So I shall make
a final effort.
No forgiveness,
no punishment.
No kingdoms,
no wealth.
Give the Pandavas free reign
over five towns, Your Majesty.
Just five towns!
[TENSE MUSIC]
Friend!
I find this proposal by Krishna
acceptable.
This is deceit, King of Anga.
This is deceit.
Krishna wants to get
the Pandavas
freedom to rule
by getting them five towns.
After attaining
the freedom to rule
the sons of Pandu
can challenge us for battle.
[LAUGHING]
Therefore, Krishna
under any circumstances
wants to pit the hundred
sons of King Dhtarashtra
against the five Pandavas
in the battlefield.
Without any help from
Grandsire Bheeshma
and Grandmaster Drona.
King of Gandhar.
If the sons of Dhritarashtra
are faced with the Pandavas
I shall stand at the forefront
as their shield.
I approve of this peace proposal
only to avoid this great war.
Not to protect myself.
The Pandavas are giving up
authority for peace.
You could at least give up
arrogance, Duryodhan.
Prince.
Krishna speaks wisely.
Accept to the proposal
of five towns.
King Dhritarashtra,
the right is yours!
Please accept it.
Grant the sons of Pandu
free reign over five towns.
Duryodhan, my son.
Accept this peace proposal,
my lad.
Liberate the entire clan
from the gravity
of this battle, son.
Spare your parents
from this pain, son.
Five towns!
Shall I concede my defeat
by giving up five towns?
Shall I accept
that I fear those Pandavas?
- No!
- Father
if a stone
is thrown at a dog and a lion
the dog barks at the stone
and the lion
roars at the ones who threw it!
Will I ever be afraid
of the thought of war?
Will I?
- Impossible!
- No, son...
And this isn't a question
of wealth or authority.
This is a matter of
personal rivalry, father!
As long as the sons of Pandu
are breathing on this earth
the entire atmosphere
seems to be poisoned
to me, father.
I would rather embrace
a foul smelling bull.
But I cannot grant five towns
to the Pandavas.
I can grant an adulterous woman
the status of a wife.
But I cannot grant five towns
to the Pandavas.
I can behead myself before Yam Raj!*
*Yama or Yamaraja, the god of death.
But I cannot grant five towns
to the Pandavas!
Listen, Krishna.
Forget about five towns
I won't give the Pandavas
even a chunk of land
spanning the tip of a needle.
I won't!
Think for the last time before
making a decision, Prince.
Because when you see your
destiny closing in upon you
I hope you do not have to run
to protect yourself.
Prince.
When an owl cannot
compel the sun to set
it closes its eyes
and imagines
that the sun has set.
You are overlooking the gravity
of the situation yet to arise.
Are you not confident about
your abilities, Grandsire?
Braver than you
was King Virat of
that little Piscean nation
who had not waved
his banner of surrender
even before my entire army.
Because the Pandavas
are your rivals.
Not just the Pandavas.
Even the supreme Yadava
Krishna is their ally.
Do not forget it, Duryodhan.
Master Drona.
Does your soul quiver
even looking at an unarmed man?
What greatness is this?
I shall assuage your worry
right this very moment.
[YELLING]
Soldiers!
Soldiers, arrest this shepherd!
Will you arrest me?
Duryodhan, you fool!
Make this attempt as well.
Duryodhan, do not
commit this mistake!
- Dhritarashtra, stop your son!
- Duryodhan! Son!
Wait, son! Wait!
Duryodhan, what injustice
is this?
Duryodhan, you may die
this very moment.
No!
I cannot end his life.
Brother Bheem is the one
who has sworn to slay him!
King of Gandhar,
fulfill your strategy!
Shackle my wrists!
[CHAIN RATTLING]
[SOLDIERS GROANING]
Foolish soldiers!
Get up!
Shackle his wrists!
Get up!
Soldiers!
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
Your soldiers cannot bear the
weight of your sins, Duryodhan!
Only you have to
commit this deed.
Pick up the shackles!
Let us see how much more burden
of sins can your soul bear?
Flaunt your might!
[YELLING]
Arrest me!
Duryodhan!
Son!
Wait, son!
Wait!
[CHAIN RATTLING]
[DURYODHAN LAUGHS]
[CONTINUE LAUGHING]
Do not do this, friend!
Such behaviour
with a messenger of peace
isn't appropriate.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
D-Duryodhan!
Move, shepherd!
Krishna not having a plan
at the back of his mind
is an impossibility.
He has a dangerous mind.
Is he
looking at me?
Yes, uncle.
Even at Draupadi's 'swayamvar
he had done such a thing.
He is calling you, uncle.
Will you go?
Yes.
Krishna has again made
a plan this time
and I must find out what it is.
Subhadra.
On behalf of Queen Gandhari
I have brought these items
for your adornment, dear.
These are items of good fortune
for the bride-to-be, dear.
Subhadra!
Calm down, dear.
Are these items
of my good fortune
or symbols of my ill-fortune?
Why are you getting me married
to Prince Duryodhan, aunt?
Dear
this...
This marriage,
this alliance
was approved by your
brother Balaram himself.
If you refuse to it now
then it will be an insult
to King Dhritarashtra
and the Kuru dynasty.
Enmity will stem between Dwarka
and Hastinapur.
But what about my feelings?
The fortune of a woman
is like the water
held in the palms
during a benediction.
If the person making
the benediction
does not consume it
then the water
falls to the earth.
But I have deemed your son
my husband a long time ago.
I am the water
in Prince Arjun's palms
during a benediction, aunt.
What...
What are you saying, dear?
This is
a complete disaster, dear.
Why do you not order your son
to come here and marry me?
This will not be an insult
to the Kuru dynasty
and I will be saved
from my ill-fortune as well.
Ar...
Arjun is bound by his oath
at the moment.
His...
His whereabouts are...
His whereabouts are
unknown to me, dear.
Then...
Then what will
become of me, aunt?
Despite having two able brothers
do I not have the right
to choose my own life partner?
Will politics be my life now?
The alliance between
the Kurus and the Yadavas
was approved by
Krishna himself, dear.
Have faith in him.
Krishna will never let
unrighteousness prevail.
This is what Arjun had said.
And I believe him as well.
Krishna will do
what he deems correct.
Princess
Vasudev Krishna has asked you
to go to
the Somnath Temple at once.
A holy man is present there
at the moment
and he has asked you
to invite him to Dwarka.
I do not wish to go anywhere.
Vasudev Krishna has said
that if the holy man comes here
then your life will be
filled with happiness.
You should go, dear.
Krishna must certainly have
put some thought into it
before asking you to do so.
Run...
Run...
Welcome, King of Gandhar!
Greetings, King of Gandhar!
Bless...
- Oh!
Be careful!
Bless you.
Welcome, King of Gandhar.
Hastinapur and Gandhar
do not have a view of the ocean.
So, enjoy the sea-shore
in Dwarka.
Uh!
Boy, be careful.
Pardon them.
No, Vasudev.
No.
We are mountain folk.
We are scared of the ocean.
All we know is
that be it man's life
or the mountains
the one who keeps
climbing the slope undeterred
eventually reaches the summit...
Be careful, child.
Pardon them.
King of Gandhar,
we Yadavas only know
that be it the ocean
or the world
the one who builds
a boat of righteousness
sails right through.
Father, the ball.
This is my son Pradyumna.
Dear, go and seek the blessings
of the King of Gandhar.
Greetings.
May happiness fill your life!
Father, the ball.
King of Gandhar,
will you play this game with us?
It is one of the games I adore!
Here you go.
Let's go.
Greetings, holy man.
Our Princess is to be married.
Do give her your blessings.
Bless you.
Are you asking for material
happiness from an ascetic?
Give me the blessing
that may my marriage
not take place today.
With whose order
are you getting married?
With that of my elder brother.
Then you should obey his order.
If Madhav wants
the Yadavas to be
on Hastinapur's side
then it must be correct.
Do you know my brother?
He must indeed,
Princess.
Holy men like him
can see even the future.
Nothing is hidden from them.
Brother Krishna has
invited you to Dwarka.
I am engaged
in a penance, maiden.
I cannot go.
But brother Krishna says
that one's penance ends
in the Somnath Temple.
And he has personally
asked you to come.
Then let's go.
Even I wish to see
what your brother has planned.
Vasudev
listen very carefully to me.
I love my nephews a lot.
I endeavour
for their happiness
but you are interfering in it.
You are foiling all my plans.
What is your plan?
What is your plan?
The throne of Hastinapur
rightfully belongs
to my beloved sister.
The Kurus have given her
a life of darkness.
So, she should at least
have the joy of the throne
and the kingdom.
That is it!
This is my plan.
That is a splendid plan,
King of Gandhar.
But how am I interfering in it?
Vasudev
if the city of Indraprastha
successfully conducts
the Rajsuya yajna
then it will become independent
and that would be
unjust to my sister
and nephews.
The entire Kuru kingdom
must once again
become united.
And it shall indeed be so,
King of Gandhar.
And that kingdom
ought to be ruled by Duryodhan.
And for this task, I require
the aid of the Yadavas.
That is why, I wish to have
beloved Duryodhan
and Princess Subhadra married
and I have even convinced
your elder brother to it.
And I did not interfere in it
either, King of Gandhar.
An alliance between
the Kurus and the Yadavas
is something
I approve of as well.
So, tell me your plan now.
My plan is very simple,
King of Gandhar.
The presence of righteousness
includes my presence too.
I shall aid in making
the Kuru kingdom united again.
King of Gandhar!
I shall aid the Kurus
and the Yadavas
in forming an alliance.
Now you must tell me
where I am interfering.
Then at this most inopportune
time, how could Arjun
reach the Somnath Temple,
Vasudev?
I am certain
that Arjun must have been
ordered to travel from
the North to the South
by you.
I did not order him.
I had merely told him
that visiting the Somnath Temple
would benefit him immensely
and that his penance
would be complete.
But I assure you,
King of Gandhar
that Arjun being at
the Somnath Temple at the moment
is not a part of my plans.
Vasudev
I have seen Arjun at
the Somnath Temple myself.
I warn you
that if Arjun is at
the Somnath Temple
because of a plan of yours
then Hastinapur and Dwarka
will become enemies.
If Arjun is at
the Somnath Temple
then Hastinapur and Dwarka
will become enemies.
A warning!
You are quite the comedian,
King of Gandhar!
But I do not lie.
However, if you
do not believe me
you may go to the Somnath Temple
and confirm
whether Arjun is present there
or not.
Boys!
Surely Arjun
has gone to Dwarka.
Subhadra.
Greetings, brother.
Bless you!
Are you angry
with your own brother?
It looks as though
even my friend is very angry.
Who dare interrupts my speech!
M-My lord..
Son Dhritarashtra.
Mother?
Are you ready, son?
I have been ready for years,
mother.
Greetings.
May you live long.
Today, your wait will end, son.
Today, you will become
the Emperor of Hastinapur.
For the first time in my life
I too am experiencing
such great happiness.
Come, my son.
By the time Vidur and Pandu
are sworn into their ranks
we must reach the court.
Come, Gandhari.
Tell her, mother,
not to accompany me.
While moving towards the throne,
if someone hampers my speed
I will not
be able to bear it.
Let's go, sister.
Whether or not you can
match up to his speed
the Kuru Prince
cannot sit on the throne
without you.
Greetings, grandfather.
Greetings, grandfather.
May you live long.
Greetings, Queen Mother.
Greetings, Queen Mother.
May you prosper.
With this 'tilak,
I inculcate
justice in my intellect.
With this 'tilak
I inculcate dedication
in my intellect.
With this water,
I acquire the truth
and swear to abide by it.
With this water,
l acquire patience.
With this white apparel
I acquire righteousness
in my life.
l acquire valour.
By acquiring this golden scepter
I accept the throne of
Hastinapur as my lord and master
Henceforth, all my relationships
and affection
shall be secondary to me.
This Royal Scepter
shall inspire me to be fearless
and steadfast.
Like this armour
I shall protect the subjects
of our kingdom.
Like this sword
I shall always lead in war.
The flag of this dynasty
and kingdom
shall always be held high by me.
For the happiness and glory
of the subjects of Hastinapur
I swear to a life
of undying struggle.
For the reputation and
independence of the Kuru empire
I swear to a life
of undying struggle.
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!
Long live General Pandu!
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!
Long live General Pandu!
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!
Long live General Pandu!
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!
Long live General Pandu!
Greetings, grandfather.
My teacher, greetings.
Greetings, Queen Mother.
May you prosper, my son.
After 25 years,
the throne of Hastinapur
shall get its lord today.
This is one amongst the happiest
moments of my life.
Today, you will take over the
duties of your father's kingdom.
For all these years,
Bheeshma and I
have safeguarded this throne.
Now, the time has come,
Dhritarashtra
to coronate you as the king
of the Hastinapur.
Stop, brother Dhritarashtra.
Chief Minister Vidur
what is the reason behind
stopping the ceremony?
The reason is, Queen Mother
that I have just taken an oath..
As the Chief Minister
of Hastinapur
I, Vidur, shall uphold
the truth, righteousness
the interest of
the throne of Hastinapur
and the happiness
of the subjects.
I will never forgo
any of these duties.
My relationships and affection
shall be secondary to me.
That is why, Queen Mother
it is my duty to stop this
unrighteousness.
What unrighteousness,
Chief Minister?
The coronation ceremony,
Queen Mother.
This coronation ceremony
is unrighteous.
A person who is
blind since birth
is unworthy
of becoming the king.
A person who is
blind since birth
is unworthy
of becoming the king.
What are you attempting to do,
Chief Minister Vidur?
Is this some sort of a facade?
Neither is this an attempt
nor a facade, Queen Mother.
This is written
in our scriptures.
A person who is
blind since birth
is unworthy
of becoming the king.
Sometimes, righteousness
can be cruel, Queen Mother.
In the best interest
of the subjects
righteousness demands
personal sacrifice.
How can you say so now,
Chief Minister Vidur?
You knew in advance about
the coronation ceremony.
Did righteousness
not strike you then?
Righteousness changes according
to situations, Queen Mother.
Righteousness changes?
I have heard such a thing
for the first time.
Although, I have heard
that motives change
but righteousness?
Hastinapur is a big kingdom.
It may have
different set of rules.
Prince Shakuni!
You do not have the right
to interfere
in our family matters!
Pardon me, great Bheeshma.
Pardon me.
A brother has the right to speak
in the favour of his sister.
This is an accepted norm
in the entire region of Arya.
Is it still the norm
in Hastinapur or not
can be answered only
by the righteous
and knowledgeable Vidur.
I can answer
your question as well.
To see absolutely no flaw
in one's elder brother
is the duty
of a younger brother.
But when the merits and demerits
of a king are being discussed
to look beyond the relationship
of an elder brother
is the duty of a Chief Minister.
But only the eldest son
of the family
has the right to become king,
Chief Minister Vidur.
When all the sons
are equally worthy
only then does the eldest son
have this right, Queen Mother.
The season of summer
precedes that of the monsoon
but the monsoon
are way more important
because it rains the most
during this season.
When deciding between
age and virtues
it is wise to choose virtues,
Queen Mother.
It is written in the scriptures
that the milk of a lioness
can be contained
only in a gold bowl
and not in one
made out of copper.
Similarly, the ability
to rule a kingdom
can be carried out
only be a complete person
and not an incomplete one.
- Incomplete!
You call me incomplete!
Pardon me,
brother Dhritarashtra.
Quiet!
Quiet.
I have been insulted enough,
Vidur.
When you're done preaching about
your so called righteousness
to this court
then have me informed.
Brother Dhritarashtra!
Stop.
Take me to my Lord, Sukta.
Alright, Princess.
Just because he has no vision
Dhritarashtra cannot
become an able king?
I do not agree to this,
Chief Minister Vidur.
Vision is the first weapon
of a king, Queen Mother.
If a king cannot
read his ministers
by their facial expressions
he will not be able to identify
the enemies of the kingdom.
When a king goes hunting
he sees the state
of his subjects.
He sees their joy and sorrow.
When one comes crying
to the king for justice
apart from hearing
the sounds of his cries
it is also essential to look
at his pain, Queen Mother.
How will a blind person
be able to do all this?
For these tasks
the Chief Minister, General
and the council of ministers
are present,
Chief Minister Vidur.
Pardon me, Queen Mother.
The Chief Minister,
council of ministers
and the General
are aides of the King.
It is their duty
to follow the king.
When the king
of a state is weak
the council of ministers
and the subjects
of the state become impudent.
Brother Dhritarashtra..
Brother, listen to me.
- Go away!
What is left to hear, Pandu?
I am incomplete?
Me?
The one who struggled with
his deficiency all his life
the one who gave it his best
to become normal
and now he's called abnormal.
He became the best.
I am incomplete?
I cannot become the king?
That is Vidur's opinion,
brother.
As the Chief Minister,
perhaps it's his duty.
But we can also put forth
our point. - Put forth my point!
Do I beg them?
Despite being the eldest child
in the dynasty
and the most capable one
should I plead for my rights?
Those courtiers, the council of
ministers and judiciary
who will be paid by me
and will be my servants..
Should I plead to them?
Please calm down, brother.
- I am calm, Pandu!
Had I not been calm
I would have killed you
for this betrayal!
Betrayal!
Brother, never have I..
I understand everything.
You and that
conniving son of a maid
have together conspired
against me!
Under the garb of love,
justice and righteousness
you want to snatch
my right from me, Pandu!
You want to become king!
This is accusations has
no merit, brother!
Never have l even dreamt
of such a thing.
Go away, Pandu
otherwise the fire
of my wrath will burn you.
Go away!
The Chief Minister,
the council of ministers
and the General
are aides of the King.
It is their duty
to follow the king.
When the king of a state is weak
the council of ministers
and the subjects
of the state become impudent.
That is why,
righteousness demands
that being complete and virtuous
is what is expected from a king.
And you are that person,
wise Vidur.
You must surely deem yourself
fit to become the king.
Prince of Gandhar!
Give Prince Shakuni a reply
Chief Minister Vidur.
The duty of a thorn is to
protect the tree, Queen Mother.
Neither does it have the desire
nor the strength
to take the place of a flower.
I am one such thorn
of the tree of this kingdom.
Whenever the question of the
kingdom's welfare will arise
I shall assume
the form of a thorn.
I know
that flowers are offered to God.
Thorns are the first ones
to be removed.
But that does not make me sad.
I shall always fulfill my
responsibility as a thorn.
Queen Mother
when it comes to the
royal throne of Hastinapur
I don't doubt Vidur's dedication
and devotion towards it.
You are correct, son of Ganga.
But even this throne
cannot remain vacant any longer.
That is why I suggest
brother Pandu should be
crowned as the king.
The driver of man's life
is fear.
Man always succeeds in finding
a reason to be fearful.
The paths we choose in our lives
are also decided out of fear.
But are these fears for real?
Think about it.
Fear means,
in the coming times
an anticipation
of trouble.
But who is the lord of time?
The lords of time are neither us
nor our enemies and competitors.
Time is subservient to God.
So if someone
merely plans to harm you
can he harm you
in actuality?
No.
But a heart filled with fear
harms us a great deal more.
Is this not true?
In troubling times, a fearful
heart makes the wrong decisions
and makes the trouble
more agonising.
But a heart filled with faith
overcomes troubling times
likes a breeze.
In other words
the reason for which man
harbours fear in his heart
fear acts
in complete opposition to it.
Is this not true?
Give it a thought.
Aren't these mangoes
the sweetest, brother?
Anything achieved with strength
seems sweet.
Go ahead and eat.
As long as your elder brother
Bhim is alive
you shall continue eating
sweet fruits.
Go ahead and eat.
- And until Duryodhan is alive
he shall continue making
those sweet fruits taste bitter.
Why are you saying so,
Duryodhan?
Your brothers shoved mine
off the trees.
They stole their mangoes.
They insulted them.
He is my brother as well,
Duryodhan.
The way Bhim is my brother,
so are you.
And brothers need to be
taught a lesson...
Bhim, be quiet.
...when they become impudent.
Will you teach us a lesson?
You?
Who have come to our kingdom
as mere refugees?
Will you teach us a lesson?
Bhim, stop!
Bhim!
Duryodhan is your brother.
Bhim, Duryodhan, stop!
Stop, Prince! What kind
of a behaviour is this?
Release me...
I shall kill him today!
Release me.
- Stop, Prince Duryodhan!
Impudent Prince!
Like a fallen fruit
your wisdom is diminishing
with each passing moment.
How dare you behave so within
the premises of the palace?
You shall be punished for this.
Pardon us, grandsire!
Even Bhim
had instigated Duryodhan.
He is equally at fault
as Duryodhan.
Then both of you
shall be punished.
Standing in front of
the temple overnight
will be your act of repentance.
Now all of you need to
go back to your abodes.
Go!
Mother, we face a great peril.
No matter what you are
faced with
the five of you must share it.
Are they foolish, uncle?
How can someone be so happy
even after being punished?
They are not foolish.
They are devious.
Devious.
They have learnt the art
of fooling people.
When they had arrived
I thought you wouldn't be
too afraid of these people
but now...
But now, I am afraid of them,
beloved Duryodhan.
Then what must I do now, uncle?
Now you must
complete your act of repentance
along with them.
And think.
Before wearing a garland
of flowers
if there is even a single thorn
then it is wise to get rid
of it, beloved Duryodhan.
There are five thorns here.
Then these five thorns
need to be gotten rid of.
I will break them
and throw them away, uncle.
And first of all, I shall
deal with that Bhim.
I shall send him
to Death.
Bhim.
Bhim.
Bhim, what had
happened yesterday?
People were
discussing in the palace
that grandsire has
punished the five of you.
Not all of us, mother.
Grandsire had punished only me.
The rest of them
were punished by you.
Mother, we had come to tell you
when you were
worshiping the Lord.
You told us to share whatever
we had got.
That is why we meditated with
brother Bhim the whole night.
But what had happened?
Why was grandsire
compelled to punish you?
It was nothing, mother.
I just ate a few mangoes.
Yudhishthir, you tell me.
It was nothing important,
mother.
Yudhishthir, because I might get
angry or upset
these four here choose to lie.
But you never lie.
Tell me what had happened.
The truth is, mother,
that Duryodhan and the Kauravas
are unhappy with our arrival.
They intend to have us removed
at any cost.
Or...
- And?
What brother-in-law Vidur
had told me back then
is now making sense to me.
In a matter of 15 years
this place has
changed drastically, sons.
Sons, listen to me.
The five of you
must always stay together.
You must never forsake
any one of you.
Here, the five of you
are your only protectors.
I have a very bad feeling,
Yudhishthir.
A very bad feeling.
This is the poison of Gandhar,
beloved Duryodhan.
The forest folks of Gandhar
dip their arrows in this
in order to kill
even the biggest of animals
in just a moment.
Did you understand?
No?
You need not worry.
You will understand everything.
I have come up
with a plan, nephews.
A plan.
Brother Bhim,
catch that ball.
Brother Bhim, you can
eat 'laddoos' later.
First, you must pay attention
to the game.
What happened?
- You hurt my friend.
She has fainted because of you.
Where is she?
What is this?
In my hands.
That?
That is a doll.
No, she is my friend.
She is in great agony.
Because of you.
Stop crying, Dushala.
Now, brother Bhim will place
his hand on your friend's head
he will take her in his arms
and gently sway her.
Then she will be
rid of her pain.
Me?
Yes, brother. You must rid
our sister's friend of her pain.
Nakul!
Do you not treasure your life?
Please take her in your arms
and sway her.
Do it, Bhim.
If it makes her
namely Dushala, happy then
there should be no objection.
Brother, you as well?
Dushala, why don't you
have some 'laddoos?
I don't want any.
Please give her some.
She has fainted.
Stop!
What happened? - My friend
fainted because of him.
And now, he won't even
give her some 'laddoos.
Be quiet, Dushala!
Princes do not play
this silly game of yours.
Return brother Bhim his ball.
But, brother Duryodhan,
admonish him first.
Return the ball else I shall
take you to mother.
Brother Bhim, you need not
play her silly games.
Return the ball.
Return the ball!
Brother Bhim, pardon Dushala.
She is just a little girl.
But even Dushashan
and I wish to apologise to you.
No, no.
You need not apologise for it.
Alright. Let me get the ball
by descending into this well.
No.
Let me go.
No, brother Bhim.
Give me this opportunity.
Let me descend into the well,
brother Duryodhan.
Is your
will power your own,
Radheya?
If you had that kind
of independence
then why would you have to
bear that crown again?
I am your wife.
I shall indeed stand by you.
Accepting every decision
of her husband
is the duty of a wife.
Stop, Vrushali.
Vrushali, I feel as though
you will never experience
any joy by living in the palace
and seeing you in pain
will make my heart
bleed as well.
I wish to be the reason
of your happiness, Vrushali.
I do not wish to be
the reason of your sadness.
If living in the palace
will make you unhappy
then you need not live there.
You have absolutely
no such obligation, Vrushali.
My child is growing
in your womb, Vrushali
and I am absolutely certain
that the values you will
impart to it in this hut
will be more than anything
it will ever get in a palace.
If you like
then you may live here
under the care and protection
of my parents.
A person sailing across the
ocean is guided by the Pole Star
even though it is
far away from him.
You too will have to
stay away from me
and guide me to happiness.
If it is written in my fate
then I shall indeed
reach that place someday.
Every time I have left my home
wearing this crown
I have lost something
very precious to me.
I must leave with
the Crown Prince soon
for Indraprastha,
Vrushali.
I cannot refuse him.
I am indebted to him
but one day, I shall pay off
all his debts and come to you
by freeing myself
of all my struggles
to rest.
Where have they built
the illusory court?
I can only see the woods
all around us.
Be careful,
Dusshasan.
I have heard that Mayasur
has built an even more fantastic
court than that of Lord Indra.
Is Lord Indra's court
this dark?
Lord Indra's court
is illuminated with the prayers
of us mortals, my darlings.
Such dedication to Yudhishthir!
Which being on earth
can illuminate this place?
A swarm of fireflies!
Let's proceed,
my darlings.
Let's proceed,
uncle.
Let's
Let's proceed,
my darlings.
Welcome, Crown Prince
Duryodhan of Hastinapur!
All of you are welcome to the
illusory court of Indraprastha!
W-What is this marvellous sight,
brother Duryodhan?!
Be quiet,
foolish Dusshasan!
Your words are like
salt being rubbed
into the raw wounds of my heart.
Be patient, my darling.
Be patient!
All this can be yours
and it shall indeed be so.
I have never accepted
defeat in my life.
Let it be,
uncle.
You made several plans
but none were successful!
I have no faith in you.
You have no faith in me!
What are you saying,
my darling?!
I am telling the truth, uncle.
I want success today...
Today!
Not in the future.
Henceforth,
I shall come up
with my own plans.
In order to be successful
one does not need a plan,
Crown Prince Duryodhan!
One needs to take a decision
and in order to take one,
one must rid oneself of fear.
Welcome, Crown Prince Shishupal!
You are welcome to the illusory
court of Indraprastha!
Crown Prince Shishupal
are you questioning
my competence?!
No
I am not
but your beloved
brother Yudhishthir is.
The sons of King Pandu
are questioning your competence.
Do you not know
how many Kings have come here
to Emperor Yudhishthir's...
Oh!
No...
They have come to the
undefeated Emperor Yudhishthir
to accept his dominance!
In the end
that deceitful
and treacherous cowherd
has made Yudhishthir
the undefeated Emperor
but the 500-year-old
throne of Hastinapur
has not yet been able
to achieve this feat.
Crown Prince Duryodhan
do you know why?
Because you
are impotent!
Shishupal!
Crown Prince Duryodhan
do you know why?
Because you are impotent!
Shishupal!
Do not resort to verbal abuses,
Crown Prince of Chedi.
The competition begun here
by the Pandavas today
shall indeed end
in the battlefield someday
and then
everyone will know
how competent each person is.
Are you not the King of Anga?
I had seen you at Panchali's
swayamvar.
Were you not called the
son of a charioteer
by Panchali?
And you had left the bow
right there at the arena.
Had I been in your place
I would have destroyed
that bow that instant!
But you are foolish!
Besides, nothing more
can be expected of you
King of Anga.
Crown Prince Shishupal
do you engage in verbal abuses
only to digest your food
or has this 'yajna
left you unhappy as well?
Unhappy?
No.
I am exceedingly unhappy!
Whenever Krishna
succeeds in something
it leaves me deeply agonized!
Was Krishna not instrumental
in this 'yajna' as well?
I shall indeed
render it ineffective!
What kind of a
Rajsuya 'Yajna' is this
where none of the other
Kings are present?
But
we saw many Kings
and maids enter through
that door, brother Duryodhan.
Even Shishupal
went through it just now.
Where did everyone go?
Look, Prince Dusshasan.
Those maids
vanish the moment they reach a
certain length from the 'yajna.
Many people must certainly
have gathered here
but because of the illusion
we are unable to see them.
Will you not seek my blessings
brother Shishupal?
In your entire life
I see nothing worth revering,
Krishna.
You are certainly older than me
but inferior in terms of action.
You are certainly older than me
but inferior in terms of action.
Even a 100-year-old
Indian Plum tree
is used only as firewood,
Krishna
and not to construct a house.
You sound like quite
the intellectual, Shishupal
but disrespecting people
elder to oneself
is a misdeed.
I do not fear anyone!
Besides, you had
promised my mother
that you would pardon a 100
misdeeds of mine, Krishna.
Besides, I am keeping a count
of my misdeeds,
Krishna.
Despite knowing
that it is a misdeed, why do
you get such joy from doing it?
What if, Shishupal
when the time is right
you forget the count
of your misdeeds?
Just because the limit is 100
pushing it to 99
is incorrect,
beloved brother.
So, Crown Prince Shishupal...
The way Vasudev's father
is an uncle to the Pandavas
similarly, is he
not your uncle as well?
Then why do you behave
in such a manner with him?
Oh yes!
I had forgotten
that at the time of your birth
Vasudev Krishna had stripped you
of all your powers.
I had heard of such a thing.
I had four arms
and a third eye when I was born.
I had the opulence of the Gods
but who knows what
that Krishna did
and stripped me
of all my powers.
Two of my arms and
the third eye.
The only enemy
I have in this world
is that wicked Krishna!
And just like me
you are utterly impotent here,
Crown Prince Shishupal.
The truth is, when it comes to
Vasudev Krishna's treachery
no one can
ever win against them.
I am not impotent like you,
Duryodhan.
Krishna was instrumental
in this 'yajna,' was he not?
I will tarnish the sanctity
of this 'yajna' at any cost.
I will let this 'yajna
not get completed at any cost.
Krishna's plan will fail.
This is an illusory forest,
Nakul.
Illusory.
Illusory?
Mother, the forest we are
in at the moment
belongs to ogres.
Many years ago
grandsire had defeated
the ogre Hida.
And had instructed all the ogres
never to leave their forest.
And had also made a promise.
Henceforth, humans and ogres
will not trespass
on each other's territories.
Since then the ogres turned this
forest into an illusory one.
Without the permission
of the King of the ogres
humans can enter this forest
but cannot find a way out.
And our teacher had
told us all about it.
Instead of paying attention to
your reflection in the 'gurukul
had you paid attention
to teacher's lessons
you would not have
asked all these questions.
I was awaiting
your arrival, sister.
Draupadi, it is almost time
to worship Goddess Annapurna.
It is the tradition
of Panchal that
this veneration is the first
one in the life of a person
right after his birth.
And Dhrishtadyumna and you
have been born just recently.
Let's go.
Why are you smiling, Draupadi?
I was merely wondering
how, right after their birth
children take part
in this veneration.
The child sits on its mother's
lap during the veneration.
And even an elder sister
is like one's mother.
So, will you perform the
veneration with me on your lap?
Me?
Onlookers will laugh at us.
Alright.
I will hold your hand
and sit next to you.
Pardon me, Draupadi
but I need to go
and command the army.
The handmaidens will
take you for the veneration.
This way.
Mother
why are you crying again?
These are tears of joy, Arjun.
Even in these difficult times
seeing all of you laugh
makes me so proud of my sons.
Difficult times?
Mother, time can
never be difficult.
When man forgets to smile
does time seem difficult.
You should rest now, mother.
Today, the five of us
will sleep outside.
How can you even
think of sleeping, Arjun?
We need to defeat
the King of the ogres
and find a way out of here.
Let's go!
- Bheem
we will not be able
to find them in here.
This is an illusory forest.
Illusory.
But we shall
certainly meet them.
That is why, quit worrying
and rest now, brother Bheem.
I do not understand you.
These ogres are
man-eaters, Bheem.
In other words,
they devour us humans.
The way you always find
a way to your 'laddoos
they are bound to find us.
We are their meal.
But you need not get
frightened, brother Bheem.
I shall protect you.
You?
You are so lean that you would
not make even a morsel of food.
You will not even
reach their stomachs.
How will you protect me?
That ogre is fated to die
at my hands, Nakul!
The biggest human of them all
will die at our hands first.
And the meat from his body
will feed us ogres
for a month.
Today, after so many years
we ogres will get to
consume human meat.
But brother
that human
seems quite strong.
What if
he defeats us instead?
Hidimba
you must use your
power of illusion somehow
and bring them to our village.
After that
they shall not be
able to face us ogres
for even a single moment.
Do remember, Hidimba
that only those
enter this forest of mine
who are
never expected to return.
During my first veneration
will you
not be there with me, sister?
Father has announced
an attack on Drona's city.
And it is my duty
to command the army.
Draupadi, I am
the General of Panchal.
Are you the General, sister?
Yes, Draupadi.
I know that women are
not appointed as Generals
but grandsire Prishat
and father
have raised me
not like a daughter
but like a son.
To me, the greatest happiness
is commanding our army
as the General.
Do you know, Draupadi
that when I behead
the enemies of Panchal
I feel as though the ties of
my previous life are being cut.
I know, Draupadi
that neither is this tradition
nor the accepted norms.
I should be here with you
on such an occasion
but...
- No, sister.
I do not know about traditions
but when it comes to norms
severing the ties of one's
previous life is most apt.
I am proud of father
that he did not differentiate
between men and women.
By respecting your wishes
he appointed you as the General.
You should lead the army
to victory, sister.
You shall indeed be successful.
And when I see the look
of joy on your face then
I too shall be contented.
Army
for the arrival of
the King of Panchal
His Highness, Drupad
be Prepared!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
Did you see, Malini?
In the entire kingdom, my sister
is the most powerful person
after the King.
Princess, the royal priest
awaits you for the veneration.
The veneration is
now complete, Princess.
You may now consume
the sacrament.
Dhrishtadyumna,
I was awaiting you.
Accepting the sacrament of the veneration of Goddess Annapurna*
*"The giver of food and nourishment", an avatar (form) of Parvati, the wife of Shiva.
is the tradition of Panchal.
Father had ordered me to do so.
Hence, I am here
to accept the sacrament.
We were born from the same
yajna,' Dhrishtadyumna.
But the joy of life
that resides within me
is never visible
on your face, Dhrishtadyumna.
I have no time for joy.
I have been born
to behead guru Drona.
This is what the Gods
have predicted.
Thinking of anything else
is a crime to me.
Someone dying at your hands
is his fate
but to dedicate your entire
life for killing someone
dear brother
is your ill fortune.
You are a fool!
To give advice to men
is not the task of women.
What kind of an argument
is that, Dhrishtadyumna?
If father thought so
then why would he appoint
sister as the General?
Father has replaced Shikhandini
with me as the new General!
Father has replaced Shikhandini
with me as the new General!
Shikhandini gave father
mere defeat.
I shall give him victory.
He dismissed sister
as the General?
In front of the entire army.
And declared me the new General!
Why hurt sister in this manner?
She must have been dejected.
Think of father's hopes,
Draupadi
and not of someone's dejection.
Who will achieve this task?!
You?!
You are a maiden, a woman
who accepted defeat
with the first blow.
I was a fool
to deem you the basis
of my strength!
You are of no use to me.
Until I get a son
I am childless!
A father never obtains
anything from his daughter.
I have got nothing
to do with a daughter!
Princess, this feast
is for family only.
Apart from family
and the guests invited
no one else can be
a part of this. - Mother Kunti!
Mother Kunti!
Greetings! Just look at
who is here to meet you!
This is my friend Subhadra.
She used to practice with me
at the students' dwelling.
She is the daughter of Vasudeva.*
Kunti's brother, also father of Krishna (Vaasudeva, with long 'a').
Subhadra!
The daughter
of my brother Vasudeva?
When starting from Dwaraka,
brother Krishna told me
that Queen Kunti is our aunt.
He said that if I
served you whole-heartedly
fortune would smile upon me.
Greetings!
Subhadra!
I hope, the health of
my younger brother Vasudeva
and that of the daughter
of Ugrasena, Devaki, is well.
And what about
the two brothers of yours?
Balaram and Krishna...
How are they?
All of them are doing well.
Hearing the heroic tales
of Krishna
always pleases my heart.
He is truly divine, Subhadra.
I would really like
to meet Krishna.
Brother Krishna says
that when the temperatures soar
the ocean is required to meet
the mountain at its crown.
If the circumstances
continue to be so
both of you shall meet soon.
What do you mean?
The meaning
of brother Krishna's words
cannot be comprehended
even by brother Balaram.
I merely listen to his words.
Subhadra, a few musicians
are present over there and
are playing some instruments.
Let's go listen to them.
Let's go.
Greetings, mother.
Greetings.
Bheem
your seat is over there.
Why are you seated
amongst the women here?
It has been years since
you have fed me, mother.
Today, you will have to feed me.
Everyone will laugh at you.
Greetings, mother.
Greetings.
You should feed him today.
The moment you feed him,
brother Bheem feels satiated.
Then all of us will be able
to have a hearty meal too.
Alright.
I shall go sit over there.
I shall be here when
we are having our meals
so that you can feed me.
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir!
Greetings. - This is my friend
from the student's inn.
She is the sister of Krishna
Subhadra.
Greetings!
- May you be prosperous!
Krishna has transformed the
politics of the Aryan region.
Brother Krishna says
transformation in politics
of the Aryan region
will be brought by you.
Dushala, I have heard that you
have completed your course
at the student's inn.
Yes, brother Yudhishthir.
I have learnt
all the arts necessary
but I could not learn
to play any musical instrument.
But Subhadra plays the veena* very well.
*String instrument from which sitar is derived.
Greetings.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Brother Arjun can play
all musical instruments.
Nakul, this is no occasion
to play a musical instrument.
Do play the veena,
brother Arjun!
Even father is not here yet.
Go on.
Play it, Arjun.
Go on and play it, brother.
Even Princess Subhadra
is eager to hear you play it.
Wonderful.
You played the veena
wonderfully, brother Arjun.
Go on and reward the other
musicians as well, Dusshasan.
Friend Karna
do you play
a musical instrument too?
Me?
Had someone else asked me
this question, friend
I would have considered it
to be my insult.
To a true archer
the sound of his bow's string
is real music.
Very rightly said, friend.
The valour of the Kuru dynasty
is being tarnished by him.
Duryodhan!
Yesterday, Arjun had you pinned
to the ground with his arrows.
Did you forget about that?
Arjun had me pinned
with his arrows
but my friend Karna
had used just one arrow
to free me from my bond.
Did you forget about that,
brother Bheem?
Even a mouse can cleave
through a bond with its teeth.
This makes him useful
and not a warrior.
King of Anga Pradesh!
You may be a skilled archer
but when it comes to debating
you cannot beat
the sons of Pandu.
Some pluck a bow's string,
while some blow a gasket.
If he displays such a temper
on the battlefield
then his enemies
even before picking up
their weapons
will faint.
Go on and play, Prince.
To entertain the maidens
you would not only
play musical instruments
but also
be ready to become a dancer.
King of Anga Pradesh!
Arjun!
Restrain yourself!
What are you doing,
Prince Arjun?
Let me tell you,
Your Excellency.
Prince Arjun
is insulting a royal guest.
A king
who is an ally of
the kingdom of Hastinapur.
By drawing a weapon on him
he is jeopardizing
that alliance.
Now, maybe Prince Arjun
will draw a weapon on
the King of Gandhar as well.
Attention everyone!
King Dhritarashtra
is making his entrance!
Sanjay.
What is happening here?
- Your Majesty.
The very righteous,
the very knowledgeable
Chief Minister Vidur
is about to do justice here.
Justice?
Prince Arjun has drawn a weapon
on the King of Anga Pradesh.
Without the permission
of the king
he has jeopardized
an alliance of the kingdom
and this is the crime
of Prince Arjun.
Arjun must be just jesting.
But dear Gandhari
the King of Anga Pradesh, Karna
is neither a friend
of Prince Arjun
nor his brother.
To jest with the King
of Anga Pradesh, Karna
is a right he does not have.
This is
a very grave crime that you
have committed, Arjun.
But uncle...
- Be quiet!
Be quiet.
You decided to forge an enmity
with Anga Pradesh?
You have given Hastinapur
an invitation to a war!
I request the King of Anga
Pradesh to pardon Hastinapur.
Because of just one person
I cannot forget the benevolence
of the king, Your Majesty.
But Arjun ought to be
punished, father.
There is just one punishment
for this crime.
To be banished from
the entire kingdom of Kuru!
My son.
All of us have waited for you
for a long time.
Your father will
be very pleased.
I'll inform him right now.
Lord!
Lord!
Kripacharya
what do these omens portend?
There's darkness everywhere.
Blood chilling screams
can be heard.
What... What kind of a bad omen
is this, Kripacharya?
Whenever a human being
with evil tendency takes birth
the entire universe feeIs it.
The entire universe
conveys its reaction
through such bad omens,
Your Highness.
In fact, the entire universe
warns of the troubles
we would face in the future.
Amidst all these bad omens
the first child is taking birth.
This child has taken birth
as a threat to Hastinapur.
Are you trying to say that
my son is a demon and is evil?
This is what's written in
the scriptures, Your Highness.
Kids who are a menace
to society are born
in this world every day.
If the scriptures were right
such an atmosphere would
persist forever
isn't it, Kripacharya?
This is no small crisis,
Shakuni.
It would be catastrophic.
Not just for the Kuru clan.
Not just for Hastinapur
and Kurukshetra
but for the entire
Arya empire.
For the well-being of oneself
and for the welfare of the state
the scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.
This child is a
threat for sure.
He is a threat, but to whom?
Is this a bad omen
for the entire state
or for an individual?
Is this a disaster for
the one
who didn't allow His Highness
to be crowned?
The child His Highness had
been waiting for
how can you even suggest that
the child be killed?
Whether Her Highness
has 100 sons or 99
it won't harm the state much.
But if this child remains alive
it would be devastating
for the entire state
and the entire clan.
I am not in favour of killing
my sister's son, Kripacharya.
Bheeshma, what's your opinion?
The thought of snatching
the right to live, from a child
pains me, Queen mother.
If it's in the interest
of the state
a sacrifice cannot be termed
inappropriate, Sire.
I believe
this decision should be made by
the one who is a king
and a father.
On the basis of dreams
and intuitions
we imagine the joy and
sorrow of the future.
To eliminate the cause of
our sorrow in the future
we make plans today.
But by eliminating the troubles
of the future, right now
do we gain or lose?
We never ask this question.
The truth is
the problem and its solution
evolve together
for a human being
and for nature as well.
Isn't it?
Think about your past.
Look at history.
You will realise immediately
whenever there's trouble
the solution comes
into existence simultaneously.
This is how the world works.
Thus, a crisis is the reason
for the birth of a power.
Whenever a person
gets out of a crisis
he has taken a step ahead
and shines more.
He's full of confidence,
not just for himself
but for the world too.
Isn't that true?
Actually, the birth of a crisis
is the birth of an opportunity
to change oneself
and to develop one's thoughts
to strengthen one's soul
and enlighten it with wisdom.
The one who is able to do so
doesn't face any crisis
but the one who is unable
to do so
is a menace for the world.
Think about it.
This child has taken birth
as a threat to Hastinapur.
The scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.
This decision should be
made by the one
who is a king and a father.
This child has taken birth
as a threat to Hastinapur.
The scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.
The scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.
This decision should be
made by the one
who is a king and a father.
Mother!
Can my son see me?
Can he see his father?
Yes, my son.
Seeing you has brought
a smile on his face.
My son...
My heir
will be invincible in
this world, mother.
It would be impossible
to fight and defeat him.
My son will be called
Duryodhan!*
*"Unconquerable one".
I am pleased
by your prayers, Kunti.
On Sage Durvasa's command
I've come to bless you
with a son.
I am very grateful to you,
Lord Indra.
The way
you are the greatest demigod
similarly, I want my son
to be the greatest human being.
Your wish
will be fulfilled, Kunti.
Your son will be renowned
among humankind.
The way I am the basis of
heaven's potential
similarly, your son will be
the basis of Earth's potential.
He will be
physically very strong.
He will be the most determined.
His heart will melt
at human misery.
He will be very soft-hearted
And due to his kind-heart
that is, his generosity
the whole world
will know him as Arjun.*
*"Shining or famous like silver."
Madri...
Why are you shedding tears?
I had gone to the forest
to collect wood, Kunti.
There I saw a family
of monkeys.
The old monkey
was having a jovial time
with his wife and kids.
There were all so happy
and at peace.
All their faces reflected
hopes of the arrival of spring.
When I saw them
I became emotional.
Did you get emotional on
seeing them happy, Madri?
No, Sister.
But there I saw
and old female monkey,
away from the entire family
sitting on a branch
all by herself.
She neither had food
nor the warmth of
the family.
Alone
helpless
and miserable.
She would have once been a
part of this happy family.
But she wouldn't have been
able to bear children.
Hence she has been
forgotten.
She is awaiting her death.
Don't you have faith
on these three sons, Madri?
No, Sister.
A new born child has no
preconceived notions.
How can I distrust them?
But when rain water
falls into the sea
it turns bitter too.
Your three sons will definitely
make my condition
like that of the
old female monkey.
Madri
don't say such things
on this auspicious occasion.
This occasion might be
auspicious for you!
Spring hasn't come as
spring for me
but as winter which will
freeze all my desires.
Today your wish has
come true, Sister.
You have defeated me with
the power of your mantras.
You have also made the king
do injustice to me.
I am not as crafty as you.
But remember one thing, Sister...
As you sow so shall you reap.
The one doing injustice has
to carry its burden with him
for his entire life.
Son, the five main parts
of a temple are
The gate pyramids,
the innermost sanctum
The pillars, the canopy
And the spire.
In the same way, a kingdom
is also divided into five parts
The council of ministers
is the canopy of the state...
The citizens are its pyramids.
The army its pillars.
The seat of justice is the
sanctum sanctorum.
And the throne is it's spire.
The Lord's idol is placed
in the sanctum sanctorum.
And a nation's glory
lies in
its seat of justice.
Will you remember this?
Then you will definitely be
the greatest king.
In order to become
Emperor Dhritrashta's heir
you have to work very hard,
Yudhishthir.
Won't you work hard?
I am content today, my son.
Your 104 younger brothers
will spread your glory
worldwide.
My lord...
It is time for the birth of
Yudhishthir's two
younger brothers.
I had the same thought, Kunti.
This time we have to
get the divine sacrament
of the
Ashwinis
the physicians of the Gods.
When Yudhishtir becomes
the king
it's important that his brothers
have the knowledge of health.
Humans, cows
horses, elephants
and other animals.
The ability and knowledge
to understand them
can be given only by
the Ashwinis.
Invite the Ashwinis, Kunti.
Yes, your highness.
But this time
I won't recite the mantra
Madri will.
My lord
even Madri has the right
to bear your children.
You have received
this boon, Kunti.
It is the reward
for your efforts.
Whether there's a crisis
in the family
or accomplishments
everyone has the right
on the proceeds.
If we want to teach this
truth to our children
then first
I will have to learn
to accept this truth.
I will teach Madri
the mantra
with all my heart.
And the mantra
will definitely bear fruit,
my lord.
On behalf of Hastinapur
I have arrived with a message
from King Dhritarashtra
O sons of Pandu!
Before plunging the entire Arya
clan down the path of battle
it is necessary that both sides
ruminate over their thoughts.
This is a request
by his Majesty.
The battle had begun
that very day, Sanjay...
When Draupadi was dragged
into the royal court
unnecessarily...
When that brute laid hands
upon Draupadis drapes...
The royal court where
Draupadis drapes were yanked
represented the Arya clan.
It represented humanity.
It symbolised the faith
of all women in the world.
So, justice shall be done
for that.
The time to ruminate
was before the royal courts
incident, Sire Sanjay.
Go tell your King
to rather ruminate
over his battle strategies.
There are two perspectives to
every incident, sons of Pandu.
If you put forth one perspective
the sons of Dhritarashtra
will put forth the other.
It is futile to debate over an
incident of the past, Pandavas.
Demise and insult
can never be the past!
A persons demise,
that is, his death
can affect all the lives
affiliated to his own.
A persons insult
affect his present life!
You speak the truth
revered Sanjay.
There are two perspectives
to an incident.
And when a battle is fought
when the perspectives conflict
only then can it be decided
as to whose perspective is true.
I approve of your anger,
King Dhrupad.
But this battle shall have
dire consequences.
You know, My Lord
that youths are sacrificed
in a battle
and what is left behind
are children and aged ones.
The old ones,
who have no direction
and children,
who have no one to guide them.
By the screams of widows
this world will be rendered
poisonous, My Lord.
If the atrocious ones
come into power
the potential of the youth
is destroyed.
The future of the children
is destroyed.
The aged ones perish.
The honour of women is violated.
Penance, justice, customs
and practices are destroyed.
Whatever losses are
caused by this battle
seem greater than that
in peace to me.
Justice can be established
even without a war, O Pandavas!
Put forth a proposal
before King Dhritarashtra
that establishes justice and
causes no destruction either.
Even King Dhritarasthra's mind
is worried by the possibility
of battle, O Princes.
He shall agree to any choice
to gain your approval
and restore your honour.
Now, if this clan
faces destruction
his wisened heart
will suffer immense pain.
If you do not approve
of this proposal
then...
Then you may continue
with the battle.
But peace should be
given a chance, O Princes.
Before the declaration of a war
attempting to call for a truce
once
is a royal obligation.
Lord Krishna,
what is your
opinion about this topic?
I have no opinion whatsoever,
revered minister.
A person may have his eyes
open or closed
when the sun rises
even with his eyes closed
he perceives light.
Similarly, one may
follow his duties or not
he surely is aware
of his duties.
I am confident
that brother Yudishtir
is aware of his duties.
What have you all decided?
Draupadi, attempting for a truce
before a battle
is a royal obligation.
And we cannot overlook
our obligations.
What does Krishna have to say?
Eldest brother has
requested Krishna
to visit Hastinapur
with a peace proposal.
And Krishna is of the belief
that one may follow
his duties or not
he is always aware
of his duties.
We must fight this battle
to vanquish the tyrants
and establish justice.
Apart from your five husbands
all the descendants
of King Shantanu may perish! [WOMAN SING]
The entire family of King Pandu
must make sacrifices
or accept the tyranny of
the sons of King Dhritarashtra!
[MUSIC STOPS]
A Peace proposal?
We cannot send
a peace proposal, My Lord!
How can we forget
our honour and our duty?
The one who ill-treats a woman
must be punished by death!
This isn't a war,
but an attempt to reformation.
This is a revolution!
And a revolution has no peace,
O Arya Princes!
Krishna cannot go ahead
with this peace proposal!
Where is Krishna?
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Krishna!
I ruminated upon your words!
I strengthened my heart.
I accepted all pains.
In spite of so many difficulties
when I swore to make a sacrifice
you have decided
against all of it?
Attempting at peace before a war
is inevitable, Draupadi.
And what if the proposal
is accepted
won't there be a war, Krishna?
This is the decision
of the sons of Pandu.
They have no rights to make
such a decision, Krishna.
I was the one who was
humiliated in the courtroom.
I was the one who was
dishonored, Krishna.
If the entire Arya clan
mocks someone
it is me.
My sons have to suffer the pain
of my mockery, Krishna.
Therefore only I shall decide
whether to fight a war
or not to.
No, Draupadi!
The decision for war
cannot be made
either for revenge
or to prove ones sanctity
to others.
The decision for war
can be made only for justice.
Only I have the rights
to demand justice, Krishna.
Indeed!
If you demand for justice
you will indeed get it.
This is my word.
- But how, Krishna?
You are going there
to have talks of peace.
How will you make it
culminate into battle?
Have faith, Draupadi.
Not just in me
but also in Duryodhan.
There shall indeed be a war!
Will we be able to
capture Krishna, uncle?
Why this doubt, my lad?
I have heard many tales
about him, uncle.
He is a sorcerer,
an illusionist.
Some even behold him
as an incarnation of God.
All those are futile talks.
Accepting fear as God
is human nature.
And the nature of fear is
one fear gives
rise
to another fear.
In reality
Krishna is
a mere human.
He is far more powerful
and his wisdom
sometimes even baffles me.
But a God...
is something he is not.
Fear giving rise to fears
is happening in your mind,
uncle.
I do not fear Krishna at all!
He had the army of Narayana
which is now with me!
He is unarmed.
So what harm could he cause?
The scriptures say
one wrestler is mightier
than two scholars.
Because he can land a blow
on each scholars head
and teach them of
the path to heaven. [LAUGHING]
My lad!
Do not be so haughtily proud
of your might.
It is difficult even
to breach close to a clever man
If Krishna has sided
with the Pandavas
even my deceit cannot help you
attain victory.
Remember!
Even the most skilled warriors
on your side
are all influenced by Krishna.
Your friend, the armored Karna
respects Krishna.
That old Bhairav
considers Krishna to be great.
Kripacharya, Dronacharya,
Vidur, all of them
fear Krishna.
If Krishna
enters the battlefield
representing the Pandavas
the might of all of
your skilled warriors
will be cleaved in halves.
Therefore
capturing Krishna
and imprisoning him
is a good move.
[LAUGHING]
I shall capture him.
In front of the entire
royal court
I shall capture him.
Everyone shall know
whether the greatness of Krishna
is true
or a mere legend.
[LAUGHING]
By the end of the meeting
all of them shall be laughing
at Krishna, uncle.
His respect will be reduced
to mockery
when he is in prison.
Be quiet, my lad!
He might overhear us.
Will he hear us
from so far, uncle?
I suspect that this person
overhears everything.
Greetings, Your Highness!
Bless you, Krishna!
I am here with a message
from the sons of Pandu.
O the supreme Yadava!
A flute just transforms
gusts of air into tunes.
But the ability to transform
Pandavas message into knowledge
can be possessed only by you.
My Lord, listening to
the tunes of my flute
the cows of Brindavan
yielded more milk.
But donkeys used to bray
tunes of their own.
The importance of tunes
lies with the listener, My Lord!
Greetings to the Queen!
Welcome to Hastinapur, Krishna!
The conflicting turn
that the Kuru clan stands at
only you can guide it
towards the path of peace.
There is only one path
to life, O Queen!
The travelers mind makes it
either a path of peace
or that of conflict.
But I assure you
that I shall sincerely try
to avoid any conflict.
The boundaries of the
province aren't its limits
but its identity.
Respecting
and understanding it
is the duty of every prince.
In face of an enemy's attack
what should be
a king's first reaction?
Ashwatthama?
If the enemy is weak
battling against and defeating
him is the best option.
If strong, a diplomacy
is the best course.
The enemy can never be strong.
Strength isn't just measured
on physical terms, prince.
A wealthier one
is also stronger.
Master, there's no gain in being
diplomatic with a stronger foe.
Because a stronger person
considers it a weakness
and doesn't respect
a diplomacy.
That will weaken us in strength
and self-confidence.
By being diplomatic with
a weaker person
the subjects of both kingdoms
are benefitted by trade
and others.
The weaker person never
violates the diplomacy.
Thus, a diplomacy with
a weaker person is justified
and battling a stronger foe
justifies bravery.
But only a single behaviour
is just for any foe, master.
Be it strong or weak.
Whoever falls in here
can't get out.
Bhim will also have
a similar death bed.
Why did you stop?
It's dusk, master.
I can't see the target now.
That means your eyes limit you.
A warrior must know his limits.
Not my eyes, master
the darkness is my limit.
If one is unable to break
a stone by his hands
is the limiting factor
the hands or the stone?
Who's sharpening
his weapons now?
It must be Arjun.
He has been freed of the task
of herding cattle, after all.
That's so unfair, brother.
We'd herd cattle
and he'd gain knowledge?
Fool!
The master's orders
shouldn't be called unfair!
The sad thing is, we are,
after all, students
but you... Ashwatthama, why
is Arjun being your obstacle?
The amount of time Arjun gets
to practice, must be yours.
My very words.
Arjun is anyway our enemy
and he's an enemy of
friend Ashwatthama too.
Arjun is an enemy of us all.
What if I kill him with
my arrow right now?
I can fire arrows
guided by sound.
Guided by sound?
What do you mean?
I mean, the source
of sound in utter darkness
becomes the target for my arrow.
Just like King Dashrath's arrow
had hit Shravan.*
Name of the boy mistakenly killed by Rama's father, King Dashrath (in epic Ramayana).
But without challenging,
it's improper to attack.
That's what master had said.
But that rule is for warriors.
Ashwatthama is
after all a Brahmin.
That's right, friend.
Here you go.
I'll remove a thorn in
your side right away.
How did he do that?
Through the sound of
my bowstring he came to know
that an arrow was being shot.
When did he gain this knowledge?
We should leave
before he comes here.
Something needs to
be done about him.
Arjun!
He is here. Then who was
the archer in the forest?
My cow is tied here!
How dare you tie
your cows here?
Brother Dushashan, this cow
is neither mine nor yours.
It is the master's.
The cow that the master charged
me with will be tied here!
Move!
Guru Drona!
Brother!
- Brother!
Brother!
- Brother Bhim! - Brother Bhim!
Brother Bhim!
Brother Bhim, give me
your hand.
Brother, hold my hand!
- Help me, Nakul!
Brother, grab my hand!
Brother, brother Bhim
has fallen into the quagmire!
Brother, grab my hand!
Give me your hand!
Brother! - Brother Bhim!
- Brother!
Brother Bhim!
- Brother Bhim! - Bhim!
Bhim, don't try to get out.
You will sink further.
We'll try to find a way out.
Brother Bhim!
Master!
- Master!
Brother Bhim!
Brother!
Bhim, wait!
- Brother!
Master!
Master...
Brother Bhim and brother
Duryodhan had a duel.
Brother Duryodhan made brother
Bhim fall into this mire.
Help me!
- Stay calm.
In face of a trouble,
find a way to get out of it.
Facing off against
an unprecedented trouble
is a part of education.
Brother!
Brother, help me!
It's dusk, master.
I can't see the target now.
That means your eyes
limit you.
A warrior must know
his limits.
If one is unable to break
a stone by his hands
is the limiting factor
the hands or the stone?
That means your eyes
limit you.
A warrior must know
his limits... If one is...
...the hands or the stone?
That means your
eyes limit you.
Brother!
Brother, grab this branch!
We'll pull you out.
Pull!
Arjun.
Wonderful, dear!
No one's that quick
to grasp archery.
You're one in a million.
You'll become the best
archer of the world.
I'll make you the best
archer of the world.
That's my oath, dear.
You'll practice with divine
weapons from tomorrow.
Tell Bhim and Duryodhan
to have a restraint on
their anger while they are here.
Else they would be
expelled from the seminary.
Whose arrow is this?
It's not mine.
Draupadi...
Your duties are five times
more difficult
than that of an ordinary woman.
Thus, it would be appropriate
that I hand over...
...my sons to you
and retire.
Henceforth,
only you have the right to
advise my sons, Draupadi.
Greetings, aunt.
May you prosper.
Parents have one great quality...
Patience.
You should be patient too.
I take your leave.
Every man faces a situation
when all his dreams and hopes
are shattered.
All his plans go awry
On the one hand,
there's righteousness
and the other is happiness.
It becomes an impasse.
When righteousness is
behest with problems.
And not being righteous
ensures happiness.
Think about it.
At times, there's a chance
to speak ill about a decent man.
Or get an easy opportunity
to steal when impoverished.
At times the immorality
of a powerful leader
or a king's attendant
comes to light.
Everyone faces such situations.
Most people don't realise
that such a situation
is an impasse.
We don't experience
any struggle.
We are easily attracted
to happiness
Just the way a bee is attracted
to a flower.
In fact, such an impasse...
...is the best time
to get closer to God.
If we don't fear having
to struggle
and are not attracted
towards happiness
and continue to be righteous
we are not too far
from meeting God.
When a leaf falls from a tree
while fighting the breeze
it goes towards the sky.
Whereas the grass that bows to
the breeze remains on land.
In other words,
during an impasse
choosing the easy path
ensures happiness
and an extended life
but doesn't it become
a blot on character?
Does it not darken the soul?
Doesn't it distance us from God?
Think about it
Your Highness!
Your Highness...
Duryodhan has taken
a terrible oath.
It will be disastrous.
It is pure evil,
my dear sister.
What's the matter,
brother Shakuni?
What is Duryodhan up to?
My dear sister, Duryodhan has
lost control over himself.
Your Highness,
at Drupad's kingdom...
The insult that Duryodhan
had to bear
has hurt his feelings badly.
I tried a lot to stop him
but it was no use.
No use at all, Your Highness.
Hastinapur insulted
in Drupad's kingdom?
Yes, Your Highness...
All the kings and princes were
seated near the podium
whereas Hastinapur
was placed at the very end.
Not only that...
My dear sister, even during
the 'Swayamvar
all the Aryan kings and princes
were called first.
And Hastinapur
was the last.
It felt as if Drupad knew
that Hastinapur is...
...no longer powerful.
The Kuru kingdom
has become weak.
Your crown prince...
...isn't worthy of respect.
That's it!
Because of the hurt caused
by this insult
Duryodhan is about
to sacrifice
the white horse of
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.
That's a greater sin than
killing a Brahman, My Lord.
Stop him!
Killing a Brahman!
It is a greater sin than
killing 1,00,000 Brahmans.
But...
It's not
Duryodhan's fault.
Not using your strength
at the right time...
...is a greater sin, isn't it?
This horse is useless,
behead it.
I will bathe in its blood
and atone for
my kingdom's weakness.
Soldier!
Raise your sword!
Stop!
Stop!
What are you doing, son?
Killing the horse of the
Ashwamedha Yagna'...
On whose orders?
On the orders of
the King of Panchal Drupad.
Soldier, raise your sword!
What is this foolishness?
The horse of
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna
symbolises the power and
prestige of the entire nation.
It cannot be killed.
What is the point of
keeping this horse alive
when the reputation of the
Kuru empire is in tatters?
No one considers us powerful.
For the past five generations
this nation
has not had the courage to
perform the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.
How can you say that
we are powerful, father?
You fool!
Don't insult the nation!
Our strength evokes fear in the
hearts of our enemies even now.
It's just your imagination.
An urn lying on the floor
is not pure.
An idol lying outside
the temple
is not worshipped by anyone.
The urn has to be placed
at the top of a temple
The idol has to be in the
innermost sanctum.
A nation's greatness has
to be proved.
By performing
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.
Father, let free the horse of
the 'Ashwamedha
tomorrow itself.
Any king who tries
to capture it...
I will defeat him and prove
the greatness
of the Kuru empire.
Duryodhan...
- That's impossible, son.
Your father is just
the acting king.
He's only the concierge to
the throne of Hastinapur.
He doesn't have the right
to perform
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.
A horse that can't
pull a chariot
or take part in battle.
And can't be the horse
for the 'Ashwamedha Yagna
is useless, mother.
My father took care of
the throne
but he doesn't have to maintain
its greatness.
So, what's the point in
occupying the throne?
Hold my coronation ceremony
at dawn tomorrow.
And the day after I will
announce to the whole of Aryavat
that I am performing
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.
Hold my coronation ceremony
at dawn tomorrow.
And the day after I will
announce to the whole of Aryavat
that I am performing
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.
Duryodhan...
calm down, my son.
Grandsire has gone to
Khandavprasth
to quell King Takshak's
rebellion.
After his return,
I will consult him
and definitely take a decision.
Consult him!
Why do we need to consult him?
A flower doesn't consult
anyone before it blooms.
The evening doesn't consult
anyone before it sets in.
Lions don't consult anyone
before they roar!
Why should a nation need to
consult anyone about
showing its strength and beauty?
Father, I have pledged to
perform the 'Ashwamedha Yagna
and I will have to
fulfil the pledge immediately.
Perform my coronation, father.
Perform your coronation!
Your father and I
will have to renounce everything
and become ascetics, son.
For the greatness of
their nation
kings have been known
to lay down their life.
Can't you lay down
your position, mother?
Father...
I can't live after being
so insulted.
Hear my decision.
Today, this sword will either
behead this horse
or your son.
The third option is
that you perform my
coronation at dawn tomorrow.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.
Greetings, grandsire.
Greetings.
- Grandsire
I want to ask you a question.
You have unfathomable
knowledge of correctness.
It is said that a kingdom
devoid of a Crown Prince
is a one devoid of
the grace of the Gods.
Then why are you
keeping Hastinapur away
from the grace of the Gods?
Somewhere in Hastinapur
or in the Kuru kingdom
was there a scant amount of rain
leading to a drought?
Or are humans and cattle dying
without any apparent reason
in the kingdom?
Then how can you deem
that we do not have
the grace of the Gods?
How could you deem
that Hastinapur is
devoid of a Crown Prince?
Who is the Crown Prince?
Brother Yudhishthir
has passed away
and I have
not been anointed yet.
Nevertheless
the Gods have not kept us
away from their grace.
What is it that I am holding?
A piece of sandalwood.
Even after being abraded,
it continues emitting fragrance.
Same is the case with
being a Crown Prince.
Whether the throne is occupied
by a Crown Prince or not
the Gods know whether a Crown
Prince is present in the kingdom
or not.
Does this mean, the Gods
know that I am the Crown Prince?
Then why am I not
being anointed as one?
Then the Kings of the
Aryan region will know
that I am the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur.
What the Gods know is the truth.
What the Kings of
the Aryan region know
changes every day.
And that is why
them knowing of it
has no value.
However, for your
contentment, if
you wish to convey
this to those Kings
then who am I to stop you?
You have been exceedingly
gracious, grandsire.
Let me go tell
father about this.
Greetings.
Greetings, uncle.
Greetings, Vidur.
You
gave Duryodhan the permission
to be anointed, uncle?
Yes.
When a Crown Prince
is already present
then even if other people
bathe in milk every day
they do not become
the Crown Prince.
Let the anointment take place.
When Yudhishthir
will return
this anointment will
get nullified on its own.
But our spies have not yet
found the Pandavas, uncle.
Who knows when they will return.
And until then, will Duryodhan
not get himself anointed?
That will not happen.
The sons of Pandu
will return soon.
I have got the news of
where they are.
But how, uncle?
Did you not hear
that a while ago,
the King of the Ogres
Hidimb was killed?
Apart from Bheem,
who else can achieve this?
Bheem
you have become a father!
Today, your ancestors must be
showering their blessings on you
from the heavens.
Hidimba has
given birth to a son!
You ought to jubilate
and worship your King Vrikodar!
Your future King has been born!
My love, this day has brought
the greatest joy for me.
But along with this joy
there is also a great sorrow.
A great sorrow.
Congratulations, brother Bheem!
You have become a father.
Congratulations, brother Bheem!
You have to become serious now.
If we laugh at you now,
you cannot get angry.
Anoint him with
your blood, Vrikodar.
When a father anoints his
ogre sons with his blood
they become adults.
Vrikodar
give your son a name.
Me?
What should I name him?
Bheem, any name
that you like.
My son's bald head
is shining like a pot.
I name him Ghatotkacha.*
*"Bald Pot".
Son
this is your grandmother
and these are your uncles.
Go on.
Touch their feet
to seek their blessings.
Bless you!
May you live long.
May you be patient.
May you be victorious.
May you be powerful.
Son
your father, King Vrikodar
is returning to the realm
of humans today.
Bid him goodbye
and seek his blessings.
We can stay here
a while longer, dear...
If you want us to.
I wish to keep all of you
here for life, mother-in-law
but I had promised you
that after the birth
of our first child
I will not ask any of you
to stay here even a day longer.
Then how can
your daughter-in-law
break her promise,
mother-in-law?
You are the ideal woman,
Hidimba.
In the future
not only ogres
but also humans will
derive motivation from you.
People will deem you a Goddess
and worship you.
Bless you, dear!
Father, whenever
you take my name thrice
I shall appear before you
to be at your service.
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
Friend Kama
do you know the importance
of this day?
Until now, my life was filled
with the darkness of the night
and unfulfilled dreams.
But henceforth, I shall
have the light of the day
and all my dreams
will be fulfilled.
[CRYING]
Radha.
Radha.
Brij Bihari.*
*One who travels.
Were you telling the truth
to Lady Yashoda?
Will you never return
to Vrindavan?
Radha.
I am taking all the
memories of Vrindavan
along with me.
But Banwari
how will you engage in
playful interactions over there?
Without you, your Gopis*
*Milkmaids.
will lose their minds.
I am leaving another part
of my life here, Radha.
I shall not engage in any more
playful interactions henceforth.
But playful interactions
will never cease in Vrindavan.
Where there is Radha
there are playful interactions.
[MUSIC]
Krishna!
Krishna, Balaram
this is the city of Mathura.
The agony of your lineage
the prison cell of your parents
and the land
of your fated actions.
Let's proceed.
This is a garland
for your victory.
We have woven
our tears into this.
Do accept this on our behalf.
His Highness has
ordered us to kill you.
In other words,
are you the one
for whom I shall require
no order before killing?
You talk just a
tad bit too much, boy!
Yes.
I do love talking.
This is my brother
Balaram.
He solely loves to fight.
You may die at his hands.
Before engaging
in a duel with us
you must lift that bow
if you have the strength.
Even numerous strongmen find it
difficult to lift it together.
That toy?
If we break that
will the owner of the toy
ask for money from us?
[THUNDER ROARING]
Who are you, Lady?
Why have you fallen at my feet?
My body is crooked
from three places, My Lord.
That is why,
everyone calls me Trivakra.
Are you truly the one
who has come here to slay Kansa?
No.
I have not come here
to slay anyone.
I merely straighten
crooked things out
be it the crookedness
of parts of the body
or that of the soul.
I merely heal things.
Guard!
Guard!
Go to the prison
and bring Vasudev and Devaki
to the grappling combat arena.
If you see any danger
looming over me
then that very instant
you need to behead them!
Go!
- All hail Shri Krishna!
- Stop!
Greetings, uncle!
Will you not give me
your blessings?
To wish for your glory
is something I would
never desire.
To wish for your long life
is also something
I would never desire.
What blessing should I give you?
Give me the blessing
that people will be
left bewildered
at the kind of death
I will meet with.
Yes, everyone
will say that
and this is my blessing to you!
I am contented
with that, uncle.
No one can call dying
in a grappling combat
a bewildering death after all.
So,
it is certain
that I cannot die at your hands.
Now, listen.
I am asking you
to release our parents.
Return the kingdom
to your father, King Ugrasen
and also his crown and throne
with due respect.
I shall pardon you,
uncle.
[LAUGHING]
Do you want me to beg before you
and plead for mercy?!
Foolish boy!
You need to prove
your competence first.
Go to the grappling combat arena
and fight Chanur and Mushtik!
If you stay alive
then you can think about
pardoning me.
I have a request,
uncle.
My brother Balaram
will engage in a
grappling combat with Mushtik
if you have no objection to it.
Shall we proceed to the
grappling combat arena?
I want those two boys
dead in the arena.
Chanur, Mushtik!
Do what you have to,
engage in any tactic you like
but they should not stay alive.
Mushtik!
Chanur!
Chanur!
Mushtik!
Get up!
Get up!
Uncle,
what have you thought
about asking for forgiveness?
Engage in a grappling combat
with me, Krishna!
If I die in this combat
my guard will slay your parents.
The lives of my sons
is now my life,
uncle.
For a smile from their child,
a mother and father
can even sacrifice
their own lives.
No, uncle.
If this war
jeopardizes the lives
of my sons
then I do not want
this war to take place.
But Duryodhan...
My son wants this war
but I don't.
What decision should I
take now, uncle?
How should I come to a decision?
You have never taken a decision
in your life, Your Highness.
The way a cloth
flying in the wind
changes its direction
according to the wind's decision
you too have spent
your entire life in this manner.
And in the end
such a cloth gets stuck
on a thorny bush
and gets shredded to pieces.
Everyone knows this,
Your Highness.
Do not use such
harsh words, uncle.
I have not come to you
as a king.
I have come here as your nephew
to seek advice from you.
The time to dispense advice
has already passed.
What advice should I
give you now?
Make Yudhishthir
the King of Hastinapur...
If you willingly
give up your position as
the crown prince to Duryodhan...
Then I will not only
discharge my duties
but also regain my happiness.
Do not attempt to burn
the sons of Pandu in Varnavart...
In Varnavart
uncle Pandu's family
will burn to ashes
along with their memories.
Allow them to live in peace
in Indraprastha...
Go ahead
and attack Indraprastha
but please give up the thought
of setting yourself on fire.
I do not wish
to merely defeat them, father.
I wish to insult them.
Do not organise
a game of dice...
Along with the knowledge
of the scriptures and weapons
a game of dice is also
a part of us Kshatriyas.
That is why,
my son Duryodhan
has organised a game of dice.
Do not let
the daughter of Drupad
be disrobed in the court,
Your Highness...
Maid Draupadi must obey
her master Duryodhan's
every command.
Do not send the Pandavas
on an exile
and force them into a life
of anonymity, Your Highness...
All five of the brothers
along with their wife Draupadi
will have to go
on an exile for twelve years
and live an additional year
in anonymity.
What advice should I
give you, Your Highness?
I know that I have committed
numerous mistakes, uncle.
I have been visionless
ever since I was born,
uncle.
An...
An
unknown fear always
surrounds my heart.
Now
if I have made a mistake
in this state of mind
then how am I at fault?
Being visionless is not
your limitation, Dhritarashtra.
Being visionless from your mind
is, however, your limitation.
You never let the absence
of vision pull you down.
Then why did you...
Why did you think that
you are less than anyone else?
And when an outsider
pointed out your shortcoming
why did you believe that person?
No outsider said anything.
You had said it.
Only then did I believe it.
When did I say
that you lag behind
others in power?
Try to recall,
uncle.
Try to recall the day I was
about to be crowned the king.
A person who is
blind since birth
is not worthy
of becoming the king.
You believed
what Vidur said that day.
You believed that a person
who is blind since birth
cannot become the king.
That is the tradition
of the entire Aryan region.
Neither Vidur nor I
are at fault here.
The greed you had
within you, to rule
the kingdom
and gain power
has reduced you
to your present state.
You have never
honoured traditions.
That is why,
the entire Aryan region
is on the verge of a war today.
If this war takes place
then my sons will die.
And if it does not take place
then the Pandavas
will punish my sons.
My sons will die even then.
Will the advice
to avert this war
be acceptable to your sons,
Dhritarashtra?
Will King Shakuni of Gandhar
allow them to accept it?
If you truly
wish to seek peace
then order
King Shakuni of Gandhar
to leave Hastinapur immediately.
A Garuda formation
can be built only
on an even ground, friend.
If the army of the enemy
bombards stones from a hill
then the soldiers might just
get crushed under their shields.
These battle formations of yours
are various ways to have
your army killed.
By talking of defeat
before the war
you are displaying your
weakness, King of Gandhar.
In the past ten years
I have conquered different
kingdoms in all four directions.
I have emerged victorious
in over 300 battles.
The uses of battle formations
and their importance
are not unknown to me.
And out of those battles,
how many were
against Vasudev Krishna
King of Anga?
A desert
may expand as much as it wants
a forest may give birth to
as much vegetation as it wants
and a river may flow
as fast as it can
but at the sea-shore
all of them
must come to an end.
Vasudev Krishna
is a formidable foe
and you may not know it,
King of Anga.
Uncle
why does Vasudev Krishna
leave you so fearful?
Fear?
One is fearful
of unknown objects, my child.
However, I know the powers
of Vasudev Krishna!
He is
so intelligent
and treacherous
that your entire...
That your entire army
can be destroyed
solely by him
in the battlefield
without any help.
A true battle formation
would be one
which would lead Vasudev Krishna
to be captured by you.
My child
as long as I am with you
you need not worry
even a bit.
A way to tackle Vasudev Krishna
is something I will
certainly find out.
Minister!
You are...
King of Gandhar,
His Highness has requested you
to leave the Kuru kingdom
at once
and proceed to Gandhar.
Your Highness!
Your Highness
what kind of an order
have you given?
What does banishing uncle
in this manner mean?
The Minister must have
been the one
to put forth this advice.
I had given
this advice, dear.
The King of Gandhar has damaged
Hastinapur's future enough.
It is time now
for Hastinapur
to think about its benefit.
Does the benefit
of the Kuru kingdom
not imply that
of the Pandavas, grandsire?
Your benefit, son.
You
and your brothers are
being blessed with life.
What the King of Gandhar
and the King of Anga
are advising you about the war
and on what basis
are not known to me.
However, rain water
cannot be held
in the palms
of one's hands for long.
The day the sons of Pandu
come to the battlefield, in the
ensuing battle of righteousness
my competence too
will fall short.
You will understand this truth
when the King of Gandhar
will stop dispensing
his harmful advice to you.
The truth is
quite the opposite to this
Your Excellency.
The truth is
that the anger
of my dear Duryodhan
can be controlled
only by my advice.
Otherwise
during the Rajsuya 'Yajna
when these warriors had been
stripped of their weapons
there would have been a war.
When dear Dushala's husband
was insulted
there would have been a war.
When Hastinapur
was about to be attacked
by the Pandavas
there would have been a war.
If you have
decided to banish me
in this manner
then this is your burden
and no one else's,
Your Excellency.
Allow me to leave,
Your Highness.
You have permission on behalf
of His Highness, uncle.
You are welcome here.
And on behalf of His Highness,
it is an order, General
to prepare the army
for a battle.
Tomorrow at dawn
the army of Hastinapur will
attack the kingdom of Virat.
Tomorrow at dawn
the army of Hastinapur will
attack the kingdom of Virat.
Duryodhan!
No, Duryodhan.
This war will not
take place, son.
You may stop the army
of Hastinapur, father
but me
and my brothers
cannot be stopped by you.
You cannot stop my friend Karna!
We 101 warriors
will attack the kingdom
of Virat tomorrow!
Instead of living
this life of humiliation
it would be better if we die.
I will not change
my decision, father.
I will not change it!
Son Duryodhan...
- My child...
No...
Shedding one's blood
does not wash away one's insult.
However, if one sheds
the blood of the enemy
then the taint of the insult
gets washed away.
That is why
if victory in the war
is not certain
then shedding one's blood
is foolishness.
My darling
do not be intransigent
about a war.
At this moment
you must forget about the enmity
and all your struggles
and stay peaceful and calm,
because in doing so
lies your benefit.
King of Gandhar
hearing you talk
about establishing peace
in Hastinapur
is both astonishing
and delightful.
Then you may keep the delight
with yourself, Minister Vidur
and send
the astonishment
to the Pandavas.
And if I have made any mistake
then please pardon me.
Your Highness
I promise you
that my dear Duryodhan
will not refute my advice.
He will certainly
meditate over
the proposal of peace.
Will you honour this request
of your uncle,
my dear?
Alright.
If you insist
then I will not
attack this early.
However... - That is enough,
my dear.
That is enough.
As I leave the kingdom, I have
honoured His Excellency's wish.
I shall always be
proud of this
Your Excellency.
Allow me to leave,
Your Highness.
In spite of you not being a king
my father sends you
his greetings.
And now, let me greet you.
I am sorry to hear that your
father died in the forest.
When the sun distances
itself from the earth
the earth is covered
with darkness.
When a father is away
from a son
the son's life is covered
with darkness.
Thus, intelligent people keep
a part of the sun
which is a lamp, they
always keep it with them.
Sir, I too have kept a part
of my father with me.
The dices.
They have been made from
the ashes of my late father.
When alive
my father agreed with me
most of the times.
And now, he agrees
to everything I say.
Five.
The son of Bharadwaj
the great teacher Dronacharya
arrives!
Greetings, Sire.
We welcome you, Dronacharya.
- Thank you.
The king wishes to know
what progress the princess have
made at your hermitage?
The king would also like to know
what is the capability
of each prince.
May king Dhritarashtra prosper.
My great father
the great sage Bharadwaj
would feel proud
such is the knowledge I have
imparted to the princes, O King.
The souls of your departed
ancestors would be pleased
such is the knowledge
derived by the princes.
I am sure my son Duryodhan
is the best of all.
Isn't he?
Why are you quiet,
O great teacher Dronacharya?
Your Majesty, I am quiet
as I wonder whether I should
sing the praises of my students
or should my students
exhibit the knowledge
I imparted them and thus
earn praises for my teaching.
What would be appropriate?
The teacher is right.
It's a tradition.
When the princes return
on completing their studies
before the subjects
of the kingdom
and before the special
guests invited
they should exhibit
their skills.
Exhibition!
We have a different
tradition at Gandhar.
Hastinapur follows its
traditions, prince of Gandhar!
Sir, it's the king of Gandhar.
King of Gandhar.
Thanks to your blessings
and favors
I am now the king of Gandhar.
I am informing the fine
traditions of my kingdom
to the king of Hastinapur.
Your majesty, in my kingdom
it is believed
that two people can
make similar swords
but no two swordsmen
can be alike.
Thus, your majesty, we hold a
competition at our kingdom
especially so that, when the
winner is hailed
the entire world learns
who has acquired how much
competence.
Now if the princes of Hastinapur
wish to exhibit their skills
like dancers
his highness would know better.
- King of Gandhar!
Hastinapur... - Has a great
tradition, Sire!
It's an excellent tradition.
The pleasure that lies
in a competition
doesn't lie in an exhibition.
We will hold a competition
among the princes.
Besides
I wouldn't be able to see them
exhibit their skills, Sire.
But on hearing the people
hail my sons
my heart would feel content.
Dronacharya
organize a competition that
you find appropriate.
The princes would mock fight
each other in the competition.
I would like to know
which prince is eligible to be
heir to the throne
of Hastinapur.
A competition!
Vidur, why are we
talking about a competition?
My elder brother
is eager to prove that Duryodhan
is the most eligible one, Sire.
I am apprehensive,
before all the invited guests
and the subjects
if there develops an animosity
between the princes
it would have dire
consequences, Sire.
In any situation
this competition shouldn't
become a duel, Vidur.
We have to supervise
it all the time.
Greetings, Sire.
- May you live long, dear.
I will not let the arrival of
the princes turn into politics.
I promise you.
Kunti.
Once I had asked you
to trust me and you did.
Today, what has suddenly
happened
for you to not have faith in me?
But Sire, the test
of the princes.
It would be appropriate
that my sons
don't take part
in this competition.
I hope people do not consider
their capabilities as ambitions
and be enemies with them.
I fear of that, Sire.
Who are you scared of,
sister-in-law?
Are you scared of Shakuni,
the king of Gandhar?
Don't have any kind of fear,
Kunti.
The snake whose venom
is extracted once
the next time it gives up its
venom very easily.
Because its previous experience
stops it from opposing.
Don't fear Shakuni.
Besides
he can no longer conspire.
He too would understand the
burden of responsibilities.
He is now the king of a state.
The great Bheeshma had made
a grave mistake by expelling me.
Pardon me, your majesty.
But my status will always
be less than the great Bheeshma.
Thus, before becoming a part
of your scheme
I would have to think
a hundred times.
An ant doesn't get trampled
under the feet of
an elephant, Purochan.
You are a man of low stature.
The great Bheeshma won't
be watching you.
Think about it.
If you help me in my plans
you will be enormously
prosperous.
And if you do not...
What are you planning,
your majesty?
Leave us alone!
The king wishes
to hear the people hail Prince
Duryodhan at the playground
and not anyone else.
Thus, the entrance door that you
will build for the playground
should collapse at
the right time.
With just one arrow.
The king wishes
to hear the people hail Prince
Duryodhan at the playground
and not anyone else.
Thus, the entrance door that you
build for the playground
should collapse at
the right time.
With just an arrow.
When it collapses, the person
standing beneath it
should reach kingdom come.
Will you be able
to fulfill the plan?
Who is this meant for,
king of Gandhar?
For the one
who Duryodhan may
not be able to defeat.
Are you making arrangements for
the test, son? - No, father.
I am making arrangements to
make my friend Duryodhan win.
You would have benefited, had
you befriended Arjun, son.
The scriptures say
one should always befriend
someone who is more intelligent
or more powerful than you.
Such friendship ends
in animosity.
There is one more
important thing.
The one who is the best
never needs anyone.
Thus, he's merciful
and doesn't befriend anyone.
I and Duryodhan
need each other.
He needs my help to attain
the throne of Hastinapur.
That's impossible.
The heir of Hastinapur
will be appointed
based on eligibility.
And eligibility
cannot be proven with
somebody's help.
To me, this is an opportunity
to make my friendship
with Duryodhan stronger.
So that, when I become
a king in the future
Hastinapur should
stand to protect me.
Father.
I have spent my life considering
a mixture of flour as milk.
I never asked for anything.
I never objected to anything.
But today, I ask of you.
Whatever happens in the
competition held for the princes
let it happen the way it is.
Son...
I cannot be unrighteous for you.
But you can at least keep quiet.
I need your assurance
that you will keep quiet.
And you will let
things happen the way they are.
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Attention!
King Dhritarashtra
is on his way!
I was waiting for this day
since the last twelve
years, Your Majesty.
And you have promised
that this day
will be the most happiest day
of my life, Shakuni.
I am sure there is nothing
lacking in your arrangements.
If my nephews are hailed
by the people
only then this day would be
the happiest day for me, O king.
And I never make mistakes
for the sake of my happiness.
Greetings, sister.
- Come Kunti, sit here
next to me.
Today, I want to see my
sons with your eyes.
I mean, your sons too.
Greetings, aunt Kunti.
Bless you, Dushala.
Aren't you anxious to watch
the prowess of your brothers?
I am really excited.
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Subjects!
Today many brave Aryan kings
and princes have arrived
in Hastinapur
to witness the strength of the
new generation of the Kurus.
To get introduced to the
strength of the Kuru dynasty
I welcome everyone
to Hastinapur.
Today on this playground
bravery and potential
would be exhibited.
And it shall reverberate in all
corners of the earth.
The praises would be heard
till the end of time!
Today, on this playground
a new history would begin.
The future of the
divine nation established
by the great Kuru ancestors
shall be decided.
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
Long live king Dhritarashtra!
To begin the competition
the one to arrive on
the playground
would be the son of the great
sage Bharadwaj
the disciple of Parshuram
the one as radiant as fire
the great teacher Drona!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
May the great king of
the Kuru dynasty
Dhritarashtra prosper.
Over there on the device
the names of all the princes
have been inscribed.
My son, Ashwathama
will shoot an arrow
at the device.
The name of the prince that
is highlighted on the device
will arrive at the playground
and fight a duel against
the winning prince.
The prince
who would stand as a winner
on the ground until sunset
that prince will be considered
the most capable.
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!
A rule has been decided
for the competition.
No prince can make
another prince bleed.
If that happens
the prince will be disqualified
from the competition.
The competition is a game taking
place between brothers
and no prince has the right
to turn it into war.
You can now begin
the competition.
Long live the great Bheeshma!
Long live the great Bheeshma!
Greetings, Prince Balaram!
You are welcome.
Excuse me,
King Shakuni
my intent wasn't to insult my
dear disciple Duryodhana or you.
No, Prince Balaram
we have no spite against you.
If you have to apologise
please do so
to your dear sister Subhadra.
I didn't quite catch your drift.
Prince Balaram
if a flower, instead of
adorning a deity's feet
graces the locks of a dancer
the happing
doesn't insult the deity.
It's but
the flower's misfortune.
King Shakuni!
Don't be angry with me,
Prince Balaram.
I am innocent.
Do you know?
When Drupad's daughter
had to marry the five Pandavas
she had taken a vow
from these brothers
that they can surely marry
a second time
but can't get their second wife
to Indraprastha.
There's just one queen
in Indraprastha.
High Queen Draupadi.
No one else.
Now you can
decide for yourself.
Your dear sister Subhadra
will spend her entire life here.
But, yes, whenever Arjun wishes
he will surely come to meet
your dear sister.
What dignity
will she be left with?
The entire Aryan nation
will mock at you.
You are my friend
and the guru
of dear Duryodhana.
That's why I say so.
If you doubt my words
ask him yourself.
So hang, Prince Balaram.
Vasudev.
King Shakuni.
Prince Arjun, if what
King Shakuni said is true
I can't put my sister in
such an unfortunate situation.
Neither will I tolerate
such insult to the Yadavs.
You have two options
in front of you.
Either stay in Dwarka forever
or else, my sister
shall start off for Indraprastha
right now, along with you.
Greetings, High Queen.
Prince Arjun is returning
after completing his penance.
His Highness has ordered
to be present at the town gates
to welcome him.
For the sake of the welcome
of the new bride
he has also asked to bring
along the veneration platter.
New bride?
Prince Arjun is arriving
with his wife
Princess Subhadra.
Prince!
You have broken the marital vow!
You have shattered my trust.
You and your wife
don't have the rights
to enter the town!
Panchali!
Panchali!
Panchali!
Greetings, brother Yudhisthir.
Be blessed, Arjun.
You have hurt Panchali.
I was helpless, brother.
Brother-in-law Balaram
ordered me
that post the wedding
either I take Subhadra
along with me
or reside in Dwarka forever.
And mother had ordered me
to return to Indraprastha
and help you in
the Rajsuya Yajna.
But what is the solution now,
brother Yudhisthir?
Draupadi's words are apt.
Arjun's quandary
is as legitimate.
Brother Yudhisthir, we must try
to convince Panchali.
Come, Arjun.
I believe Panchali will
surely heed to us.
No matter where we live,
there will be just one queen.
And that
will be Princess Draupadi.
That's our vow.
We pledge that we shall
always bide by our vow.
Panchali.
Your orders, Your Highness.
Not an order,
rather it's a request, Panchali.
Please think on the situation
that has come up.
Stopping Arjun
from entering the town
will be unfair to the town.
The town will remain incomplete
without Arjun.
Without Arjun,
my very life is incomplete.
Just for the sake of a vow
I have made my very life,
a penance.
We all have.
That Indraprastha will have
no other wife of you brothers...
It was the vow
that you had taken.
Arjun can't break that vow
and nullify our penance.
If Arjun
wishes to live with
his second wife
he will have to
forsake Indraprastha forever.
If Arjun
wishes to live with
his second wife
he will have to
forsake Indraprastha forever.
But, Panchali
how can the Rajsuya Yajna
be done without Arjun?
How can we ever be independent?
The dream of a great kingdom
will remain unfulfilled.
Does our penance
cause the kingdom
or the desire to have a kingdom
cause our penance?
You have to decide
whether if sweetness
causes sugar to have a value
or if just because it carries
a value
does sugar taste sweet.
If a kingdom is that important
then you all are capable enough
just attack Hastinapur.
It will be unrighteous
but unrighteousness is the cause
of polity in the Aryan empire.
Why should we be any different?
Bear in mind though.
From underneath massive rocks
if a bit of soil is swept away
those rocks tumble down
from their mountains.
A violation of penance
is even easier.
Thus, if Arjun wishes to live
with his second wife
he shall have to forsake
Indraprastha forever!
Prince
won't sister-in-law come
to welcome me?
Subhadra
we might not be able
to even enter the town.
Subhadra, where are you going?
To get you forgiveness.
High Queen
this has been sent
to you
with a request
to keep them safe.
Who sent them?
She says she's a woman
from Dwarka.
This has also been sent by her.
She said
that you can keep it safe.
Tell the High Queen
that it's a request from me
to keep this keepsake safe.
You must be Subhadra.
You must be Subhadra.
Greetings, High Queen.
When I had started from Dwarka
brother Krishna had given me
these gifts.
All that he had got
from Mathura and Vrindavan.
All those souvenirs.
Brother Krishna had told me
to keep these very safe.
But, High Queen
I feel
I have made a terrible mistake.
I won't be able
to keep them safe.
How would they not be safe?
Your husband is the world's
best archer!
Anything that comes
under his protection
can never be harmed.
I beg your pardon, High Queen
but brother Krishna said
that these are no royal borders
that protection can be given
through weapons.
To keep souvenirs pure
and protected
love and dedication
are required.
Just look at my husband!
He forgot his very vow!
How can he protect
these invaluable souvenirs?
Subhadra!
Arjun is my husband too.
I can't bear to hear
a word in his insult.
The vow that he'd given me
is my concern.
You need not concern yourself
about it.
No, High Queen
I was mentioning about
the vow he had made to me.
He had said that
I'd hold the supreme position
at Indraprastha.
That I'd have power over all.
You wish to become
the High Queen of Indraprastha?
No, High Queen!
A High Queen
has many responsibilities!
She never finds a moment's rest.
I want to have power over
the High Queen of Indraprastha.
And Arjun had said
that it'd surely be so.
Don't speak lies, Subhadra.
I know Arjun.
He can never teach anyone
such a grave ploy.
Surely Govind
has taught you this.
Yes, High Queen.
Brother had said that if I was
to be the cause of your spite
I should have the words
to soothe you as well.
Brother had said
that wherever force
doesn't work
love always conquers.
He had said that if I remain
my simple self
I'd be able to queen over
the High Queen.
That's what brother had said,
High Queen.
Will you come
to aid us again, Govind?
Indeed
but
I will not be able
to aid all of you
where you are headed
at the moment.
All of you must succeed in the
life of anonymity on your own.
The time for your life of
anonymity is drawing closer too.
Which place would be appropriate
for our life of anonymity
Vasudev?
Brother Yudhishthir
is the Emperor.
The entire Aryan region
knows him.
Brother
the most difficult task for man
is to remain hidden
because in order to remain so
one must first expunge
oneself of one's arrogance
and forget one's competence
one's respect
one's class
and one's existence.
If family and friends
fuel your arrogance
then none of you
will forget who you are
and if the enemy
challenges your arrogance
then you are bound to get angry
and show yourselves
to the world.
You must choose a place
where no one recognizes you.
A place where you will get love
but not get attached to anyone.
If someone does insult you
you ought to be able
to pardon that person.
Where can such
a place be, Vasudev?
In this vast Aryan region
there must be a King
who you are not acquainted with.
In this vast Aryan region, there
is only one such King, Vasudev.
The person I am
alluding to is King Virat.
Yes.
Only in the Matsya kingdom* of King Virat will all of you
*Matsya ("fish") is located south of the Kurus, and west of the Yamuna river which separated it from the kingdom of Panchalas.
be able to
safely lead a life of anonymity.
Certainly, Vasudev.
The day Arjun returns after
completing his meditation
we shall proceed
towards the Matsya kingdom.
He shall return soon after
succeeding in his endeavour.
Arjun has such
a strong determination
that he can achieve
even the most arduous
of meditations.
The animal shown in this scene
was generated
using computer graphics.
You seem to be the indigenous tribe of Kirat.*
*The Kirati or Kiranti people in the Himalayas (mid-hills) extending eastward from Nepal into India, Burma and beyond.
Who are you?
I am meditating here.
Let me take my arrow out.
You can take this warthog then.
I shall indeed take it away.
I was hunting it after all.
So, I shall take it away.
Pardon me
but this animal was killed
by my arrow
and not yours.
You may certainly take it away.
He insulted you,
Your Highness!
He said that he
hunted that animal!
Then he must certainly be
stronger than you.
He is a better archer than you.
Since you are the King,
you must demonstrate
that you are the stronger one
and not him!
I am Arjun,
the son of Pandu.
I am more skilled
than a tribal person.
The son of Pandu!
Such arrogance!
Can you see that hollow
on that tree?
You must pierce it.
I had killed this warthog
with such lightning speed.
You must not have
even seen my arrow.
The focus required
to be a great archer
does not reside in you.
Can you fight using a sword?
A true warrior is one
who can use
all weapons proficiently.
Pick up the sword,
Prince.
Do you accept defeat?
Are you not tired yet?
No
I am not tired
but when Lord Shiva
himself is one's opponent
how can a person win?
Being a disciple of guru Drona
no tribal man
can ever withstand
my attacks for so long.
Lord Pinaka*
*Vishwakarma.
had made the first bow known as Pinak*
*Shiva's bow.
and had taught the entire world
the art of archery.
Punish me for
my mistakes, My Lord
and please do appear
in your true form.
Bless you!
Lord Indra requested me
to give his son the knowledge
of Pashupatastra.
However, without testing
your worthiness
I could not give you
the Pashupatastra.
A person who is worthy
knows divinity in a moment.
The truth is
the one who recognizes
the greatness of others
is truly worthy
but My Lord
I could not recognize you.
I must certainly not be worthy.
Lord Indra
your son has
acknowledged himself
that he is not worthy
of acquiring the Pashupatastra.
A person who
deems himself worthy
is not truly so,
My Lord.
Worthiness can be truly known
only by the person
taking the test.
You have the ability to become
truly worthy, son of Kunti.
I am pleased with you.
I shall teach you how to
use the Pashupatastra.
It is not a weapon
but knowledge.
Falling prey to unrighteousness,
when the enemy becomes weak
he can be killed using
ordinary weapons, son of Kunti.
However,
often times
one has to kill an enemy
who is also righteous.
It is impossible to kill such
enemies with ordinary weapons.
The ones who walk
on the righteous path
are blessed with
my refuge after death.
I have made such
a promise to the world.
That is why,
the Pashupatastra brings
the people who have always
walked on the righteous path
to my refuge after death.
You shall receive
the Pashupatastra now.
Bless you!
Twelve years are
almost over, uncle.
Today
before dusk
we must find those Pandavas
and stop them from
leading a life of anonymity.
When the last ray of the sun
fades into darkness
the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas will begin.
When will we abduct
Draupadi, uncle?
My darling, Arjun
has not returned yet.
But I have a feeling,
uncle
that Arjun will return
before dusk today.
I have firm faith
that he will return
but at the moment
the might of the Pandavas
is not that considerable.
Before Arjun returns
we must abduct Draupadi.
But how is that
possible, uncle?
We cannot attack the Pandavas.
We are bound by
our promise, uncle.
We cannot attack them
but
your sister
Dushala's husband
King of Sindhu, Jayadrath,
most certainly can, my darling.
I
have come here
to aid you, Duryodhan.
We cannot attack them
but
your sister
Dushala's husband
King of Sindhu, Jayadrath,
most certainly can, my darling.
I
have come here
to aid you, Duryodhan.
Now...
Now
I have promised your sister
that I shall
indeed aid you.
Welcome,
King of Sindhu.
Be seated.
I am grateful to you
for coming here to aid me
but these four Pandavas
never leave their wife Draupadi
by herself.
One of them
is always present
to protect Draupadi.
Four of them!
I can defeat 400 Pandavas
in one go
and abduct Draupadi.
King of Sindhu
you are Dushala's husband
and the son-in-law
of Hastinapur's royal family.
That is why, I do not
wish to insult you.
However, a frog cannot
inflate its throat
and become the size of a bull.
King of Sindhu
I think the competence
of the Pandavas
is something
you are not aware of.
Duryodhan
you are my brother-in-law.
That is why,
I have
not given you a demonstration
of my competence yet
otherwise...
And
may the Almighty never
give rise to such a situation
King of Sindhu.
You are correct.
You are not only
free to attack them
but also competent enough
but
I have a solution
using which you will not have to
engage in a battle.
Yudhishthir
performs
the 'Sandhyavandana'* every morning
*Salutation to twilight (dawn and dusk) or solar noon.
by going to a river bank.
Bheem
and Sahadev
go to the village
to distribute alms
to the poor.
That leaves Nakul.
Every day,
for 90 minutes
he is given the duty
of protecting Draupadi
all by himself.
If we can
somehow
keep Nakul
away from the hut
then without having to fight
you can abduct Draupadi.
He too has a heart.
I've closely
watched him
strive over the years.
He knows
that the path
he's headed on
isn't just or right.
If we succeed in persuading him
then we could awaken
his conscience.
No, aunt.
No.
Only once
he experiences awakening
we'll be able to persuade him.
And
you'll have to do it.
Me!
How would I do it?
I tried to tell him
a lot of times
that he's my son.
I either couldn't find
propitious time
or a circumstance to express it.
How would I face him now?
How will I
persuade him?
Krishna
you're omniscient.
You are compassionate
towards everyone.
Only you can forgive me.
And...
Ask for forgiveness
on my behalf.
Once...
For once, request
him to do what is right.
Just once.
One who favours righteousness
is always favoured.
I can only remind
Karna of what's right, aunt.
Since you've asked me
I'll certainly make a request.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Karna is addressed as Radheya
by the whole of Arya clan
because of you.
I salute you for inculcating
righteousness in Karna.
I've failed
since my son's endorsing
the ones who are unjust.
My son was a pure soul.
I don't know
why is he defending the evil.
Perhaps he isn't aware
as to who he is.
You're here to meet Karna
but he doesn't stay here.
He stays in the palace, Krishna.
I know.
I also know
that he'll certainly
come here today.
Like a bird seeks shelter
in a tree
to find solace
away from the Sun.
If he's tired of standing
by injustice
he'd come here.
His family has treasured
righteousness as legacy for him.
Karna, your destiny
is an accumulation
of all your decisions.
One decision
can alter your destiny.
It can transform the future.
Decisions are derived
out of human perspective.
Altering perspective
is a herculean task.
The thoughts
a human has been harbouring
all his life
influence him.
When one's thoughts
can't be altered
one's decision too
can't be altered.
Hence, the future remains
uncertain as ever.
Prince Duryodhan too
could've set things right
for himself.
But he can't do anything
about it now.
It's ones experience
that influences
his thoughts, Krishna.
One who's experienced
injustice all his life
considers everyone around him
as an enemy.
What's wrong with it?
My friend deserves the throne.
How can you say that?
His father's the King.
A King's son
is crowned as a King.
Do you mean one's birth
determines what one deserves?
And not his capabilities!
You're trying to talk me
into things.
All I desire is respect.
I've never desired for power.
For I know
one's birth
determines ones rights
and one has to earn respect.
Then you only have
the right
to be a charioteer, Karna.
Don't you want
to be a part of this war?
When everyone around me
mocked at my capabilities
my friend, Duryodhan
rewarded it with what
it rightfully deserved.
I'll have to support him now.
I don't consider it
a war at all, Krishna.
I am just here
to carry out my duties.
If you were born to a King
and you rightfully deserved
to be a King.
You weren't being favoured.
Would you still call
this war a duty?
It's baseless to reason
on this, Krishna.
For I wasn't born to a King.
I don't have the right
to be a King.
For one's birth
determines one's rights.
If you ask me
one who's capable
deserves the throne.
And respect...
Self-respect is the optimal
form of respect.
For one who expects
to be respected
is never sated
with the amount
of respect one gets.
Like you're
so lost
in your quest for respect
that you aren't able
to differentiate
between the right
and the wrong.
I don't think
Duryodhan's wrong, Krishna.
Because you're looking
at the truth in fragments.
I'd told you
that one's decision
carves out one's destiny.
One decision of yours
can alter your destiny.
Assume
if Kunti was your mother.
How can I assume that?
I am Adhiratha and Radha's son
who's indebted to
Duryodhan for eternity.
No, Karna.
You don't know
whom you were born to.
You owe your capabilities
to the Sun God.
You are
Lord Suryanarayana's* boon.
*The Supreme Light.
How do you say that? 
Karna
you weren't born
to Adhiratha and Radha.
They found you floating
on the Ganges.
So...
Who was I born to, Krishna?
You were born
to Kunti, the Queen.
Your father is
Lord Suryanarayana.
Hence you were born
with earrings and a shield.
You may ask Adhiratha about it.
You may ask
Lord Suryanarayana too.
Then
you may alter your perspective
and decide.
It's a request.
Mother!
Mother!
Where are you, mother?
Karna, my son!
I was cooking up
a meal for you.
Mother...
- What is it, son?
What did Krishna say?
Krishna is evil, mother.
He's vicious.
Duryodhan was right.
What did he say?
- Answer me, mother.
I...
I am your son, right?
Right?
You certainly are my son.
You definitely are!
That evil Krishna has been
trying to delude me.
He wants to talk me into
things by deceiving me.
The King of Gandhar said
that he'd definitely make
an effort to deceive me.
But how can one
deceive me this way, mother.
He said
that my entire life is a lie.
He tried to make me believe
that I've been living a lie
all my life.
He deluded me
to such an extent
that he questioned my existence.
He said
that you're not my mother.
That's what he did, mother.
No one can separate us, son.
You are my son.
My son.
Who told you that you weren't
born to me and Adhiratha?
How greedy can one be
to utter such a lie?
I've always been drawn
to the Lord Suryanarayana
since I was a child.
I can look into the eye
of the scorching Sun
that people stay away from.
No matter how heavy I feel
whenever I happen to see the Sun
I feel at ease at once.
My heart's filled with joy,
mother.
But...
But that doesn't mean
that I was a boon
from Lord Suryanarayana.
Isn't it, mother?
But that doesn't mean
that I was a boon
from Lord Suryanarayana.
No, son.
Try to recall.
Try to recall, son.
When you were a kid
and I'd go to fetch water...
I used to pay attention
to you as you'd cry even
when I stood near the well.
Yes.
If you weren't my son
how could I hear you cry.
I am your mother, child.
How can he say
that you aren't my son?
How can he say that?
I am your son, mother.
I am your son.
You certainly are my son.
During your childhood,
when you were to save a kid
and you slipped off
the chariot.
I almost died.
Only a mother would be
so concerned, right?
Yes.
- And... And come here.
Look at this, son.
Look at this.
I've served you food.
How would I know
what you'd like to eat
if I wasn't your mother?
I might not have given birth
to you.
But I was the one
who raised you.
Son...
Duryodhan?
Greetings, father.
Son.
Did Bheem come
to Praman Koti with you?
No.
He did not come with me.
Dushala said
that she had seen him.
Eldest brother Yudhishthir
was occupied
and so was Arjun.
So, he said that he will
be there with the others.
Then where did Bheem go?
If he was not with Duryodhan
then how would Duryodhan
know about him, sire?
True.
Your majesty!
Your majesty!
Your majesty!
Your majesty!
Your Majesty, have me beheaded!
Have me beheaded, your Majesty!
I truly deserve death,
your Majesty.
I truly deserve death.
After delivering
such a terrible news
I have no right to live,
your Majesty.
I have no right...
What are you rambling about?
Your Majesty.
The fate of Kuntibhoj's daughter
is marked with misfortune.
Such penance
exile
the death of her husband
and now this.
Your Majesty
Your Majesty, grief and agony
are choking my heart.
My heart breaks.
What news do you bring,
Prince of Gandhar?
News?
What news do you bring?
The news, great Bheeshma...
Soldier.
A hunter had gone to the woods
to hunt for game this morning.
There, inside the den of a tiger
he found these ornaments.
I fear
that these ornaments
belong to Prince Bheem!
Bheem!
Bheem!
Bheem... No.
Mother! - Mother!
- Mother!
Mother, what happened?
Mother? - Mother?
- Mother?
My son...
Bheem.
My...
My son cannot die.
Bheem.
Bheem.
Mother!
- Mother! - Mother.
13 days later.
Vidur.
I have seen the deaths
of my younger brothers.
First, the death of Pandu,
who was like a son and...
And now
the death of Pandu's son.
What has destiny
in store for me?
What has it decided?
God tests only
the competent, sire
Perhaps, to teach patience
to ordinary people.
The 'Brahmin' children are here,
great Bheeshma.
Sire, for the peace
of Bheem's soul
it is time for
the 'Brahmins' to be fed.
Let us proceed.
Enough of this, Kunti.
Bheem's...
Bheem's death
took place 13 days ago.
And you have been shedding
tears for the past 13 days.
Stop crying, Kunti.
Stopping my tears
cannot stop my weeping,
sister-in-law.
Your Highness, here you go.
One question
will keep agonizing me
for the rest of my life.
Why?
Why did my Bheem
go so far away from me?
Why?
Brother Bheem has
not gone anywhere, mother.
He will always be with us.
He will live in our hearts.
Brahmins,' for the peace
of Kuru Prince Bheem's soul
do consume the food
that will be served to you
for which we shall be grateful.
Uncle.
- Yes.
What kind of a boy is he?
He eats so much.
I'm perplexed too, dear.
But we have
no other alternative.
Until all the young 'Brahmins
are satiated
we must serve them food.
Arjun.
In order to serve food
to the 'Brahmins
we must go to the courtyard.
If I feed
the young 'Brahmins' myself
then I will feel
as though...
As though I am
feeding my Bheem.
Your Highness,
we have a problem.
We are out of food
but there is a young 'Brahmin
who is not yet satiated.
He is asking for more food.
Mother...
Mother, now I am satiated.
Bheem...
My son.
Where had you gone?
I am Vasuki,
the King of Serpents.
My soldiers told me that you
put up quite a fight with them.
He was biting me.
Upon Pawan Dev's* request I had sent my soldiers to you
*Other name of Vayu, Pavana (the Purifier).
for your protection.
There was poison in your body
and in order
to cancel out its effect
I had sent my soldiers
to bite you.
Only poison can
nullify the effect of poison.
Could he not have told me that
before biting me?
We serpents are
of a furious nature.
But your ancestor, King Shuvasu
had married
the serpent woman Marisha.
The blood of serpents
runs through your veins.
That is why it is natural
for you to get angry.
I am not only short-tempered
but also very strong.
My serpents have experienced
your strength.
I am extremely pleased
with your courage and bravery.
No poison shall ever harm you.
Here you go.
Consume this.
With the help
of this special concoction
you will be blessed with
the strength of 100 elephants.
My blessings are with you.
The dinner today is
based on a simple rule.
None of you shall bend
your elbows while you eat.
Let's begin.
Why do we need to
fold arms, Duryodhan?
We could feed each other.
Well done!
That's the apt way
to eat, Yudhishtir.
All of you may follow
what Yudhishtir just did.
Your Excellency...
His Highness
has summoned you.
Princes...
This is not the just
the apt way to eat
but a way of life.
As long as siblings
care for each other
it helps the family
stay together
and makes
the kingdom prosper.
All of you must
have meaIs this way.
Duryodhan, it's time
for you to feed us.
I want 'laddoo'.
We must follow the directive.
When one reciprocates
rudely to a kind
gesture of yours
or if someone's gets rewarded
for one's crudeness.
Then one's forced to think that
what does doing good
and being ethical yield?
But one must think what
a crude human being attains.
One who possesses a rude
demeanour is seldom at peace
and never experiences
stability.
Such a human being would
always stay anxious.
Faith makes him
chase after itself forever.
Is that happiness?
But the one who's ethical
the one who's kind
and the one who possesses
a kind demeanour
experiences peace.
Nothing proves as an
obstacle to such a human being.
Such a man always
receives respect
and experiences tranquility.
That proves that a kind gesture
isn't a way to attain
happiness in future.
In fact one who's kind,
is happiness personified.
A bad gesture too
may not yield sorrow.
Iniquity, at that very moment,
springs forth sorrow.
Righteousness doesn't
become happiness
but is happiness
in itself.
Hail Lord Shiva!
For Pandu's soul to
rest in peace
I've arranged to venerate
Lord Kaleshwar.
That's good.
I was about to
suggest you the same.
But why would the
soul of a pious man like Pandu
be not at peace, grandsire?
Religious texts state that until
the son does the final rites
the departed's soul remains
in the netherworld.
I mean to say
the son has to get married
and experience fatherhood.
And that helps his dead
father's soul attain salvation.
You mean, the happiness
of progeny is paramount
to a father, grandsire.
But the subjects of
a kingdom are
like a King's children too.
Their happiness is of
utmost importance to him.
Vidur, don't be diplomatic.
Whenever I talk about my son
you alter your
religious teachings.
That isn't true.
- If that isn't true
then whenever I talk about
my son's coronation
why do you speak against it?
- I am not against Duryodhan.
But it's not yet time
for his coronation.
Bhil women who belong to the
Malanchal mountains in the South
used sandalwood as fuel.
You must be aware of that.
If one's rewarded things
one doesn't deserve
he may not value it.
That may make him irresponsible
towards his duties too.
Mathura's King Kansa has
been killed
by his nephew.
I hope you know of it.
If a King isn't loved
and respected by his subjects
he can't remain a King for long.
Do you want Duryodhan
to be proved
an incompetent ruler?
Then you must put his
abilities to test, grandsire.
Before that, I need
to appoint a teacher
for the princes.
I want all of them to
to attend the seminary.
They've to become
capable enough.
Their abilities can't be tested
before they undergo
rigorous training.
Vidhur, arrange for
the same at the earliest.
But once they undergo training
Duryodhan needs to
be crowned a King.
He needs to be crowned.
After they undergo training
the prince who's eligible
shall be crowned the King.
That's a promise, dear.
But you'll have to judge
all of them as a King.
Not as a father.
Nakul,
Sahadev...
You both are
still awake?
We are unable
to sleep, mother.
Yudhisthir and Bhim
slept before you?
I will punish both of them
tomorrow morning.
Mother, I haven't slept.
We all are still awake.
The forest was calm
and peaceful, mother.
But there is no
peace here.
That's true, son.
Here the soldiers stay awake
all night and guard.
And the attendants in
the kitchen, stay up all night
and make preparations for
the next day's meals.
And brother Bhim is already
hungry again, mother.
It may be because you must
have eaten a lot.
You are not used to
the lunch here.
We haven't had yet.
Grandsire asked us...
What did your
grandsire say?
Nothing, mother.
The attendants here are
still unaware
that brother Bhim is
also called 'Vrikodar'.*
*'One with a wolf's belly'.
They served very little
and brother Bhim was
shy to ask for more.
Nothing else.
I will inform
the attendants tomorrow.
Okay.
Today you all
sleep here with me.
Mother
till when are we going
to stay here?
Nakul
we will now stay
here itself.
This is our home.
Mother, what kind
of a home is this?
Where no one even smiles
on seeing us.
It seems like
that we have refuge here
but no rights.
Who made you feel like this?
Everyone here is
unfamiliar.
Hence they are unpleasant.
The more we get acquainted
their love will increase.
Nakul. Sahadev.
Now, sleep.
It's such a big palace,
brother Bhim.
I have looked in
all the directions
but there is no path
leading to the kitchen.
You are of no use.
Just yesterday we had
been to the kitchen.
Even you had gone.
Do you remember?
You talk a lot.
Even Durbheeksh hasn't
come yet.
Or else he would have
shown me the way.
Greetings, Princes.
- Greetings. - Greetings.
Hey, mister.
Do you work in this palace?
- Yes, Prince.
Then you must be well
aware of this palace, right?
Which path leads
to the kitchen?
The kitchen!
That's very simple.
Go straight from here.
After going straight
turn towards the south.
Take ten steps south.
And then again turn
towards the east.
After turning towards
the east
go down towards
the west again.
After that you can use
your sense of smell
and you will know where
the kitchen is situated.
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Greetings.
Nakul, did you
remember anything?
I feel that if we walk so
much in the forest
we will reach
the nearby village.
What do we do now?
This hunger is
killing me.
What happened?
- Nakul
that attendant has given
a unique solution.
Make use of
your nose.
I can smell raw mangoes.
Let's go.
Nakul
this is like heaven.
The food made by
the attendants
stands no equal to
the food made by God!
We have the rights
on this tree.
Find some other tree.
We have taken possession on
all the trees in this orchard.
Where will he
now find mangoes?
There are mango trees in
Kuntibhoj too!
If you want to eat mangoes, you
will have to travel till there.
I needn't travel!
If I want mangoes
I can take it from
your hands too.
If he wants mangoes he can
take it from our hands too!
You can definitely
take it from our hands.
What's the big deal
in that?
The weak have to beg!
Brother,
let me go.
No, Bhim, we are not
supposed to fight.
Come, I'll arrange lunch
for you.
Of course! The city is very big.
You can beg anywhere.
That's what your ascetic
father must have taught you!
Now they have crossed
all limits, brother.
Forgiveness shouldn't be
to such an extent
that it becomes a sign
of weakness.
That's what father used
to say.
You're absolutely right, Arjun.
It is not appropriate to use
such words for our father.
Listen, everyone
my name is Vrikodar.
The tree that I shake...
All its fruits fall down.
Did you hear that, dear?
He has challenged
you and your brothers.
That when time comes
he can
kill you too.
He spoke about
killing us? - Definitely.
The tree that I shake...
All its fruits
fall down.
The interpretation is
that even if it be a mango tree
or a tree of lineage...
He will ensure all
fruits fall down.
Child!
My dear child!
This is politics.
You know that!
In the forests, whom do
the lion cubs fear most?
The other lions.
Princes too
fear other princes.
What would be an
appropriate solution, uncle?
There is only one
solution, child.
The strategy that
Pandavs have made for you
make the same
strategy for them.
Here, master
rest your head on my thighs
and continue to rest.
Karna
I am habitual of taking rest
on stones and rocks.
You're habituated, master,
but it's not a necessity.
Give me a chance to serve you.
Please come.
Forgive me, master.
This...
This bug bit me
and I bled
hence your sleep
was disturbed.
Forgive me, master.
Oh, God!
Such a deep cut!
Such severe pain!
Yet you didn't move!
You stayed firm!
No!
Who are you?
Who are you?
I...
I am your disciple, master.
- Impossible!
Only a Brahman can be
my disciple.
And you, undoubtedly,
are not a Brahman.
Had you been a Brahman
such patience
and so much tolerance
wouldn't have been your traits.
Tell me honestly.
Who are you?
I...
I'm not a Brahman, master.
I'm the son of a Suta.
But you had told me
that you're a Brahman.
You lied to me?
You cheated me!
The truth has always
humiliated me, master.
Had I told you
that I'm not a Brahman
but a Suta
then I'd have returned
disappointed again.
You fool
you have committed
a very big mistake.
If you had shared your
pain with me
then I would have definitely
sent you to a qualified teacher.
Karna
I am not
an opposer of caste
or lineage.
I had
sworn to teach only Brahmans.
My grandfather sage Rucheeka,
all his life
taught people of all lineages
the veneration of Lord Shiva.
If you had said
the truth, dear...
If you had taken
the path of truth
then you would have
definitely been benefitted.
Karna
how could you forget
that lies
are synonymous
with a weak nous?
And no form of education
in the world
gives results
to weaklings, dear.
Not at all!
Just like the leaves of
some trees
do sway in
the warmth of the sun
but wither off during
the winters...
Karna
in the same manner
a weak person's knowledge
gets destroyed at
the time of a test.
It is of no use to him.
This is not a curse, dear.
It is a reality!
The truth of life!
Go, Karna!
There will be a point
in your life
when it will be the moment of
the biggest test in your life
and at that very
moment
your knowledge
will leave your side.
It will disappear.
It will not be of
any use to you.
Lord Parashuram
I regret being unaware
of your generosity.
God does not differentiate
unlike the common man
and I couldn't comprehend it.
I weighed God against
the common man.
It was my mistake.
These words, that are a
result of your disappointment...
I accept them as your
sacrament, master.
Won't you
bless your disciple, Lord?
Your struggle
and your mistake
both in the times to come
will guide many a youth.
This is my blessing, dear.
May you have a long life.
Near Hastinapur.
Before the princes' return
from the seminary.
Go tell the king of
Gandhar Shakuni
that Guru Drona's son
Ashwatthama has come.
With the message of
Prince Duryodhan.
Your Highness
Guru Drona's son is here.
He wishes to meet you.
Greetings to Shakuni,
the King of Gandhar.
Marvellous!
You have applied ashes
on your body
and carry weapons too.
My past is that of a Brahman,
and my future that of a king.
Hence I prepare myself for
protecting both
my body and my soul.
This means, master Dronacharya
has conspired to shake off
the political condition of
the Arya dynasty.
Which state is it?
With time, even that shall be
revealed, Your Highness.
But right now, the question
is not about me
but my friend, Duryodhan.
Duryodhan said
You had promised the throne
of Hastinapur, uncle.
Do you remember that or...
My child!
My child!
I remember as well as
am determined for it.
Hence I have left Gandhar
and come here.
To Hastinapur.
For 12 years, one question
wouldn't let me sleep
that Guru Drona, when
starting his seminary
instead of imparting education
to the entire Arya dynasty
why did he find it appropriate
to educate
the princes of
only one lineage?
This complication is now
being resolved.
Only the Kuru princes will
get you a kingdom.
Which means your friendship
is not with Duryodhan
but with the throne
of Hastinapur.
Then I would have had
affection for Arjun.
My father too says that Arjun
will get me a kingdom.
Yes.
I have heard
that Arjun has become
a great archer.
But, Ashwatthama
the one who can get
you the kingdom
can snatch away
the kingdom too.
Hence in your heart
there should not be affection
towards Arjun but fear.
Don't you have faith on
my friendship?
I do.
But in order to make your and
dear Duryodhan's friendship
even more stronger
I am coating it with
greed and fear, both.
See, Ashwatthama
the biggest political setup
of the Aryan dynasty
is going to begin
here at Hastinapur.
Hence it is necessary that
everyone knows their roles.
Tomorrow, if your father
begins to have affection
for the Pandavas
or if he talks
about righteousness
then at that time, it will
be beneficial for you
to teach your father
the lesson of greed.
But for that, we will first have
to make Duryodhan the king.
You just mind your own business.
Leave the rest to me.
Duryodhan's enthronement
will definitely take place.
At any cost.
At any cost!
Time had once defeated
me in my life.
Since then
I have always walked
ahead of the times.
How will I be able to recognise
the footsteps of my son
My lord?
When our sons had gone
to the seminary
they were children.
I have never seen
their faces.
Yet I could recognise
their every step.
Whenever Duryodhan
would enter the room
I could say whether he is
happy or sad.
Duryodhan would have
changed a lot, right?
Of course!
Definitely my Duryodhan would
have changed, Gandhari.
Now
his walk shall have
the dignity of a king.
And when one walks
with prestige
the earth recognises
that glorious footfall
and produces a sound
deserving of him.
Shakuni!
But there's only one question,
Your Highness.
Does the earth know
that the footsteps
that lay on it
are those that exude authority
or ambition?
In order to welcome Duryodhan
the sound that needs to be...
What if the earth
emanates the same upon
Yudhishthir's arrival?
Since the time of the return
of my dear nephews
is getting closer
I also came here.
Greetings, Your Highness.
I did not understand
the meaning
of your question.
The meaning of my question
remains the same
as it was 12 years ago,
Your Highness.
Capability!
The time to test capability is
getting closer, Your Highness.
And in order to prove dear
Duryodhan incapable...
There are many people
sitting alert
in Hastinapur's palace,
Your Highness.
Brother!
Don't make the arrival of
princes a political affair.
Politics!
Politics!
I won't, dear sister.
But tell the same thing to
His Excellency Bhishm
and Chief Minister Vidur.
Because, definitely
by now
they would have begun to make
this a political affair.
Before the arrival
of the princes
Guru Drona will arrive to
meet His Highness.
Definitely,
His Excellency Bhishm
and Chief Minister Vidur
will ask him questions
on capability.
What is the solution?
There's only one solution,
Your Highness.
You yourself make capability
an important issue.
Attention!
King Dhritarashtra
is arriving!
Long live King Dhritarashtra!
Long live King Dhritarashtra!
Long live King Dhritarashtra!
Welcome to Hastinapur,
King of Gandhar.
On having met
you again
my heart feels at peace
Chief Minister.
Please have a seat.
Are you
exiling me from
Hastinapur, Your Excellency?
It is considered appropriate
that a king stays
in his kingdom.
And the courage
to disobey my orders
does not lie
in Gandhar.
Leave!
You cannot slay my father.
You will have to slay me first.
You are wonderful, Draupadi.
In order to re-establish
righteousness
I shall require two weapons.
You are one of them
and the other is Arjun.
What happened, Arjun?
Mother, I can hear
a woman crying.
Brother Bheem's stomach
must be growling
because of hunger.
My stomach's growling does not
sound like a woman crying.
It sounds like a lion's roar.
Brother Bheem!
Arjun...
Arjun!
Stop!
Who are you?
And what are you doing in this
illusory forest, alone?
Are you...
Are you an ogre or a human?
A human.
Had I been an ogre
I would have asked you
whether I should fry
or roast you for my meal.
Show yourself
and tell me who you are.
These ogres devoured
my entire family.
I managed to escape
from there somehow
but now, I cannot find
a way out of this forest.
Come with me.
Four brothers of mine and
our mother are resting nearby.
We shall protect you.
Yudhishthir...
Son, where has Arjun
gone, all alone?
That too in this
illusory forest.
I am very worried about him.
Mother, you need not worry.
We shall find him.
I shall go look for him.
- No, Bheem.
Now, no one will go
anywhere, alone.
All of us will go together.
Arjun had gone
in that direction.
But even his footprints
are not visible.
I shall rip out all the trees
of this forest, mother!
We will find Arjun.
Brother Bheem
you may put the tree down.
Arjun
who is...
Mother, this maiden was crying.
Her
parents were slain by the ogres.
She is terrified.
That is why, I have
brought her to your refuge.
You need not worry, dear.
My sons will protect you.
Brother Bheem will protect you.
Right, brother Bheem?
- What! Yes.
Since it is mother's order,
I shall certainly protect her.
Why won't I?
What is your name, dear?
How did your family end up
in this terrifying forest?
How did your family end up
in this terrifying forest?
We were on a pilgrimage.
We lost our way
and entered this forest
and...
And in this forest
the ogres...
The ogres devoured my family...
Calm down, dear.
No need to be afraid now.
We should leave now.
Yes.
But will you be able to walk
or do you need
to rest for a while?
She shall indeed
be able to walk, mother.
When I saw her,
she was sitting and crying.
She was not engaged
in any physical labour.
Arjun!
It is not right to laugh
at another's plight.
Pardon me, brother Bheem.
Mother asked if you will
be able to walk or not.
Yes, I am alright.
Let's go.
In which direction are we
proceeding, brother Yudhishthir?
Even the sky is not
visible here.
How will we find our way out?
During this season
the wind always blows
from East to West Nakul.
That is why, we are
headed towards West.
This is West.
It smells of meat from here.
This forest reeks
from all directions.
But that is the smell of food...
In other words,
it is the meal of the ogres.
And some of this smell
is also from the fruits that
have fallen from the trees.
I have become familiar
with that smell now.
Can you tell us from this smell
from where we can find
some fruits to eat?
Certainly. There must be
some fruit trees ahead.
The smell of fruits
is coming from there.
Wonderful!
How strange!
The fruit trees are so near.
However, brother Bheem has
not gone to pluck them yet.
The way you have conquered sleep
similarly, brother Bheem
has conquered hunger.
Then we need to conquer
hunger as well
because I do not think
that brother Bheem
will go to pluck fruits for us.
Arjun, be quiet.
Bheem.
Son, go and get the fruits.
As you say, mother.
Brother's hunger got quelled
even though mother
didn't feed him.
Many people transform pride
into their life's goal.
They toil away recklessly
to add a feather to
their existing pride.
But, what is pride in reality?
Have you ever thought
about that, King Drupad?
No.
If you ever had,
you would've realized that
a person blinded by pride
begs for respect.
He wants everyone to praise him.
He always craves to hear
about his glorious past.
It implies that he expects others
to acknowledge his strengths.
He never has faith upon himself
whatsoever.
He lives in fear
of being a weakling.
He never has any sort of power.
It means
the one filled with pride is
also surrounded by fear.
Your Highness.
Isn't pride just another name
for fear?
Think about it, Your Highness.
Your Highness.
Fear chains your heart
and pride is a link
in that chain.
Take yourself for instance.
A man drowned in pride can
never appreciate love.
You have earned enmity
of your friends.
And your children...
Your children are no more than
weapons of assault for you.
Madhav
Have they attacked from both the
East and the West?
This is not a mere attack, friend.
His Excellency has created a battle
formation in the war.
It is called the "Sarvodo Bhadra Vyooh".*
*Sarvatobhadra Vyuha: safe from all sides.
Only when the "Vajra" lies outside
this formation
can it be broken.
Bet our army is almost in the center,
friend.
His Excellency Bhishma
had been awaiting this moment.
He has the capability to break all
our battle formations.
Grandsire will annihilate our entire
army, Madhav.
Sons of Panchali!
I, Ashwatthama, the son of Guru Drona
am your doom!
Get acquainted with me!
Ashwatthama
we are the flames of a terrible fire!
You will not be able to extinguish
us!
King Virat, Dhrishtadyumna and you
need to go to the back of the army.
The army has no protection there!
Charioteer, make haste and move
forth!
But the sons of Panchali are present
in the East.
Bheem!
You need to go and hold off Ashwatthama! You
need to go protect the sons of Panchali!
Arjun, stay with brother Yudhishthir.
Ensure that neither grandsire nor
Duryodhan reach him!
No, Bheem!
Arjun must go and battle with
revered guru!
- But brother Yudhishthir... 
- Brother Arjun!
You need to go and protect the army!
If Guru Dronacharya is not stopped
today
then the war will end today itself.
Go on!
Move forth, charioteer!
Arjun and Bheem
had to leave Yudhishthir and go.
Now, Ashwatthama and Guru Drona
will not allow Arjun and Bheem
to return to protect Yudhishthir!
Today, for the first time in life you
have the opportunity of battling me.
Pick up your bow.
You shall strike first.
One more thing.
Ensure that your hands do not
tremble while doing so.
We had pardoned each other a long
time ago, friend!
Then why should I take to arms
against you?!
Help me recall an incident, friend
that will prevent my hands from trembling
while shooting my arrows at you!
"You are like my father."
"Why is such a thing happening with
me?"
I remember, friend Drona!
My daughter...
You had witnessed the daughter of
your friend being disrobed
in a court full of people!
Did the greatest warrior in the world
not have an iota of competence
to protect an aggrieved, a woman, 
a daughter?!
That was the gravest crime of my life,
Drupad.
I cannot be pardoned for that crime.
When the time is right I shall willingly
accept the punishment for it.
But by accepting the punishment
you gave me today
my head is at peace.
Now, my hands will not tremble
while discharging my duties, friend.
Even Nakul and Sahadev will have to
leave Yudhishthir now.
Release the orbs of fire!
Yudhishthir is by himself now.
It is time to attack him.
All the foot soldiers
and Atirathis*
*Rathi: a charioteer, ati: extremely skilled.
need to attack Yudhishthir, the son
of Pandu!
Ashwatthama!
Will you keep trying to prove yourself a
good archer by threatening young boys
or do you truly have the competence
to fight?!
Teacher!
Won't you allow your student an
opportunity to combat?
Opportunity is for exhibiting skills
but one's summoned for a war.
What do you want?
I neither need an opportunity or a
summon.
I just need your blessings.
Vikarna, I can't kill you
for Bhima has vowed
to kill you and your brothers.
But I can make you faint for sure.
I can surely kill you, Nakul.
Certainly, Vikarna.
If you could survive armed for a
moment or two before me.
I'll die of embarrassment.
Let the war begin!
Prince Duryodhan
it's time to attack Yudhishthir.
I'll take you to Yudhishthir.
As per the tradition
only a King can capture a King.
In this battlefield
you'd be representing your father.
Be ready to capture Yudhishthir.
Charioteer, move forward.
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!
The Grandsire has created a
splendid maze.
He has split all the Pandavas
and is taking me to Yudhishthir.
I told you, my child.
That's why even though he's old
he holds a greater significance over
others.
Yudhishthir will soon be captured by
us, brother.
The war would come to an end
and we'd emerge victorious.
Victorious!
Don't hold him captive. No!
No matter what the Grandsire has
asked you to do.
As soon as you see an opportunity
you must...
kill Yudhishthir.
Prince Uttar.
Uncle's life is in danger.
Send a signal to my father.
Madhav, brother is battling all alone.
If he is captured we will lose the
war.
Madhav, take the chariot towards him.
Our face off is not yet complete,
Arjun.
Charioteer, let's move forward.
Then from this moment
this archer is a king.
I declare him king!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
All hail Prince Duryodhan!
No, Prince.
I do not covet a kingdom.
I have not come here to ask
for a kingdom in charity.
Respect shown towards my art
is sufficient for me.
I do not wish for anything else.
The entire Kshatriya lineage
has been defamed by you, friend.
So, you ought to get
a chance to compete.
Far away in the west
there is a forested region
beyond Magadha.
That place
is called Ang Pradesh.
Grandfather Bhishma
had triumphed over
the people of that region.
But today,
it is devoid of a king.
I declare you
the King of Ang Pradesh.
How can this be?
No, Prince.
Do not indebt us
with such benevolence
that can crush all our lives.
I have no intention
of being benevolent
Sushena.
I consider all great warriors
to be my friends.
Prince Duryodhan!
Neither do you have
an authority over Hastinapur
nor Ang Pradesh.
The truth is,
even a small amount
of land cannot be donated by
you for you have no authority!
You are correct
but his Highness
has that authority.
Maybe, his Highness
will fulfill his son's wish.
After all, it's about preserving
the honour of the Kuru dynasty
Your Majesty.
I, King of Kuru, Dhritarashtra
from this very moment,
declare this lad
the King of Ang Pradesh!
With my blood, I take the oath
that the charity made
by my father today
will be upheld by me
till the moment I die.
And I shall always defend it.
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!
Prince.
I honour the order
of His Highness
and with his blessings,
I take the oath
that henceforth
my property
my kingdom
my competence
and even my life
will forever be
at your service, Prince.
Your friendship
is sufficient for me.
Go on.
Fight.
Now, what are you looking at
your teacher for, son of Pandu?
Now, do you doubt
you being a Kshatriya?
Maybe he is
because everyone has heard
that the five of them
were not born with the blood
of our dynasty.
If Arjun is my son
he will certainly
accept this challenge.
Before letting his father's name
get defamed
he will accept death.
Sanjay!
Who got defeated?
The fight has not yet reached
a conclusion, your Majesty.
Only a few moments
are left until sundown.
The verdict must be in
before sundown!
The power of the mantra
does not go in vain.
After I leave,
a fragment of my power
will stay back with you
in the form of a boy child.
My son will be invincible,
Kunti.
The entire world will know him
by the name of Karna!
Princess...
Princess, he is...
What happened, Kunti?
T-That lad...
Princess... - Mother Kunti...
- Princess Kunti!
Mother Kunti fainted!
Princess...
Princess?
The competition has ended,
King of Ang Pradesh.
The sun has set.
It seems, you have
Lord Surya's grace upon you.
That is why the Sun God
upheld your honour.
Is darkness the limit
of your art, Prince?
No.
I cannot be unrighteous
in order to be victorious.
Resorting to unrighteousness
while proving one's superiority
is not art but arrogance.
But do not be disappointed,
King of Ang Pradesh.
You are a king now.
You will have more opportunities
to engage in fights.
Son.
Son...
After I leave,
a fragment of my power
will stay back with you
in the form of a boy child.
Karna!
Princess... - Karna!
- Princess, calm down.
Calm down, Princess, and
do remember as to where you are.
My...
My...
He...
He... He is my son.
Karna!
My...
M-My son Karna.
Karna who?
I know only about the five sons
of yours, Princess.
What...
What are you saying?
I am telling the truth,
Princess.
Even the world knows only
about the five sons of yours
who are the sons of
the late Kuru King Pandu.
And you have no son.
What are you rambling on about?
He is my son.
He is the gift of
the Sun God himself.
Princess.
Only the feathers
attached to a peacock
act as its adornment.
The feathers that fall off it
act as a medium to dust
the seats of saints.
Do not talk like a fool,
Priyamvada.
A peacock feather may also act
as an adornment of a crown.
He is my son, Priyamvada.
He is deserving of the rights.
After so many years
he has come before me...
To have his mother's love.
To garner affection.
To...
To ask...
To ask for his right.
But Princess
he does not even know
that you are his mother.
Man must not feel sad for
something he could never have.
Think of the five sons of yours.
Think of their sorrow.
If the society finds out
that Karna was born to you
out of a wedlock
there will be no appreciation
in his respect.
But the five sons of yours
will certainly be ridiculed.
They...
They were talking about
the Pandava's mother?
Duryodhan must surely
be conspiring to have
the Pandav brothers and their
mother killed at Varnavat.
I must speak to
Grandsire Bheeshma about this.
Why did you have to
wake me up, brother?
You will be eating alone.
Nakul, I'll share
the food with you.
But first, help me
locate the kitchen!
Years ago, an attendant
had told us the way.
Use your sense of smell.
My senses had failed me and
that's why I woke you up.
There's no aroma of food
emanating from anywhere
in the entire palace.
Come.
Let's find the kitchen.
Guard!
Nakul, don't raise your voice!
Everybody will wake up!
The guard is supposed
to stay awake.
Greetings, Prince!
Guard, show my brother
the way to the kitchen.
Prince, the kitchen is
located outside the palace.
You mean, this huge palace
doesn't have a kitchen?
Forgive me, Prince Bheem!
I wasn't aware that you have
your dinner, late in the night.
From tomorrow,
this maid will stand outside
your chamber, holding a
plate full of delicacies.
Please step forward!
But why did you not construct a
kitchen in such a huge palace?
The maids preparing the food
should remain outside the palace
so that you and the queen
are not inconvenienced
that's why, Prince.
But it's very inconvenient
for me.
Get a kitchen made in
the palace.
But, Prince Bheem...
- Why do you stutter?
Will the palace go up in
flames if food is prepared here?
What are you afraid of?
No, Prince Bheem.
Why would I be afraid?
And why would the
palace go up in flames?
Follow my dictum!
As you wish, Prince!
This is rather astonishing!
Such a huge palace
has no dining room!
If you pronounce Yudhistir as
the crown prince in court
tomorrow, I will not care
about the reputation
and dignity of Hastinapur.
Very soon
you will be rid of
your worries, Bheem!
Leave us alone!
You called for me, father?
Why is Purochan at Varnavat?
Have you made Purochan
construct a new palace?
Indeed!
My dear brothers will
be staying at Varnavat.
Therefore, I had to get a
palace constructed.
This means you are responsible
for their journey to Varnavat.
Tell me the truth!
Why do you seem
so stressed, father?
Why am I stressed?
I am worried because I am afraid
that you must have planned
something at Varnavat which
would be totally unscrupulous!
Unscrupulous!
Father, there's no morality
in anything immoral.
If a drop of poison is
put in milk
the milk becomes
contaminated, father.
When I had poisoned Bheem
you knew then that it's immoral.
But it didn't trouble you
all that much, father.
Yes, I wasn't troubled
back then.
A powerful man wishes
for more power!
Someone with moderate
income wishes for wealth.
But in old age.
In his old age when he knows
that he will die soon
then a desire for fame,
glory and honour
are what he yearns for.
The body doesn't last
but one can at least
hope that their name lasts
until the end of time.
My son.
Please don't engage in
activities which might malign
My image posthumously!
I know that you are the
epitome of righteousness.
Whenever a choice has to
be made between my happiness
and your righteousness
I am the one
who suffers injustice!
That's the reason
behind me not disclosing
My Plan to you!
Son!
Please listen to me.
During acquisition of kingdoms
warriors do die but...
Murdering a woman
is disgraceful, son.
If anything happens to Kunti,
what do I answer Pandu
in the netherworld
past my death, son?
What do I answer him?
Father.
When a flame burns, it's
not just the fuel that burns
but the wick too.
One who bothers about the wick,
cannot obtain light.
But you have never lit a lamp
in your entire life.
Perhaps that is why
you are unaware of this fact.
In Varnavrat, even the memories
of uncle's family shall burn.
This is my decision.
Go inform His Highness
that the prime minister needs to
discuss an important matter.
Pardon me, Sire.
His Highness Bheeshma
is in the playground.
He is examining the new
recruits in the army.
Soldiers, if the enemy surrounds
you from three directions
and leaves you
no way to escape
then retreat backwards,
feigning defeat.
This makes the enemy carefree
and he lets his guard down.
Then, seize your
opportunity and...
Attack!
In battle, it isn't strength
that is important
it's the timing.
What is the reason
for your smile, Vidur?
It's surprise, Grandsire!
Greetings!
- Bless you!
They say that a 'Gandharv'* may sing all his life
*A community associated with singing and dancing to entertain the gods.
yet he never sings
the same tune twice.
He brings forth something new
every moment.
Even you teach me something new
every day, Grandsire.
I had taught you this strategy
in your childhood, Vidur.
Yes you had, Grandsire.
But then, I hadn't been able
to understand the fact
that in battle, timing is more
important than strength.
Waiting for the right moment
isn't defeat
but it's strategic instead.
I shall take leave,
Grandsire.
Bless you!
Vidur!
Were you here for a purpose?
- Yes.
And that purpose
has been served, Grandsire.
When one learns what he
wants to, he is happy.
And when one learns what is
worth learning
then he attains bliss,
Grandsire.
Greetings, Grandsire!
Greetings, Sire.
Have this sack of grains sent
to Varnavrat immediately.
Any message along with that,
minister?
Yes.
Just tell them
that when a single grain
is sowed into the soil
it yields many more.
Nakul.
Which damsel awaits you
at Varnavrat
that you are grooming
yourself so much?
I have heard that just the royal
maids are present in forests.
Not the princesses.
In fact, I suggest that you look
into the mirror too, brother.
Have you ever thought
what would happen
if an ogress falls in love
with you?
Nakul.
- Bheem!
Mother is waiting.
We should get going.
Mother!
It's time for the veneration!
But Arjun isn't here yet.
Let us wait a while for him.
Arjun will be here soon, mother.
Let us begin the veneration.
Long live the sons of Pandu!
- Long live the sons of Pandu!
Long live the sons of Pandu!
Glory to King Pandu!
- Glory to King Pandu!
Glory to King pandu!
- Glory to King pandu!
Long live the sons of Pandu!
Greetings, princes!
Greetings, queen!
Princes, the minister has
sent you all a present.
Why has uncle
sent a gift here?
Brother
bowing before the wind does not
rob a tree of its strength.
Sailing with
the current of the ocean
does not insult a sea vessel.
Surrendering my weapons to you
is not an insult to me.
In fact, it is an honour
brother Yudhishthir.
I have a feeling that
when it comes to strength
and military strategies
you are superior to me.
Regarding the decision to crown
you as the Prince of Hastinapur
me
and my brothers
accept it.
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
Brother Bheem,
what are you doing?
I had soaked these bitter gourds
overnight in a sugar solution,
Sahadev
but they still taste bitter.
If you soak them
for a year then maybe
they won't taste bitter,
brother.
If Duryodhan can change then
bitter gourds stand no chance.
Even if you soak them for life
there won't be any change
in them, Nakul
because bitter gourds are
defined by their bitterness.
Think positively, Bheem.
All of you should
try to think positively.
No one can have
such a weak heart
where righteousness
cannot dwell.
My heart isn't that weak, uncle
that righteousness
can dwell within it.
Five!
Do not say so, son.
Righteousness is
the basis of this world.
You cannot resort to
unrighteousness, son.
What is righteousness, mother?
What is it?
Righteousness is for
the solace of incompetent
and weak people.
The Almighty gave us a heart
and desires along with it.
Then how can
fulfilling those desires
be deemed unrighteous by anyone?
No, mother.
I know what righteousness is.
I have been taught enough
about it in the 'gurukul
but pardon me, mother
I cannot live by it.
I have just one goal.
To have the throne
of Hastinapur.
Mother, the blessed event
I had been awaiting since birth
is drawing closer now.
Which blessed event
were you awaiting, son?
Greetings, mother.
At the time of my birth
when I had asked the great sage Vashishtha*
*One of the Saptarishis (seven great Rishis) in the seventh, i.e. the present Manvantara, or age of Manu.
about the path to my
enlightenment, he had said
that after fulfilling
all my duties on this earth
if, on the day
of the summer solstice
I leave this
earthly vessel of mine
then the Lord of the Sun
will take me northward
and show me the way to heaven.
Mother
Yudhishthir was crowned
as the Prince today.
Today, the royal court
of Hastinapur
was blessed with righteousness.
Today...
Today, I accomplished
the goal of my life, mother.
Are you certain
that Duryodhan has curbed
his ambitions?
But after the crowning
ceremony of the Prince
Yudhishthir and his brothers
will be able to protect
themselves from Duryodhan.
That is why...
That is why, today
my purpose was served, mother.
How can just one incident
fulfill the purpose
of someone's life, Bhishma?
The purpose
of one's life is served
only when he is free of
all ties and relationships.
But mother
I have no ties.
I was merely
carrying out my duties.
Even a duty is a tie, son.
Until you find the way
to free yourself from this tie
you will not be completely free.
Do not say so, mother.
Even after leading
a righteous life
how can I not be free?
Mother
how can I finally be free?
I cannot tell you that
but very soon
someone will arrive
who will make you realize
your true duty.
Not only you, son
but also the entire world
will learn about
its true duties.
When you will
attain that knowledge
you will finally find yourself
to be free.
Righteousness.
Everyone meditates over it.
Some discuss their own
and some, about that of others.
People keep discussing
someone else's unrighteousness.
There is no one who has never
meditated over righteousness.
But in true terms
what does righteousness mean?
Has anyone ever been
able to understand it?
Righteousness
teaches man how to
live with others
and to live with
the entire creation in peace.
This is the reason why
in the presence of righteousness
man always feels at peace.
Have you not experienced it?
In other words, righteousness
ends all of man's struggles.
But how can it be possible
for a man to not have
any struggle with another?
Think about it.
Does struggle also exist
in the presence of love?
Your answer to this
would be 'yes
but if you think a little more
about it, you will know
that when one struggles
with something
one forgets about love.
And then
desires come to the forefront
arrogance and anger come
to the forefront but love?
No.
Love does not
come to the forefront
because when love
comes to the forefront
all arguments, all struggles
and all fights
come to an end.
What if such a love develops
for the entire world?
Not only for mankind
but also for flora and fauna
and even a blade of grass
if one has love in one's heart
then can anger ever exist in it?
Certainly not.
The feeling of love that exists
in one person for another
if that same love is
extended to the entire creation
then it is termed as compassion.
Compassion, in other words
to accept the entire world.
To have nothing
but love for everyone.
To not protest against anyone.
Compassion is truly
the essence of righteousness.
If righteousness is a tree,
compassion is its basis
and its root.
But there are instances
in life when man
completely forgets
the basis of righteousness.
He clings to a few rules
and traditions.
But compassion?
He forgets all about it.
And the world gets
permeated with struggles
with jealousies
with exploitation, with anger,
with hatred!
In other words,
with unrighteousness.
And then
the Almighty is required
to take an avatar
to impart the right knowledge
to man.
The epic of Mahabharat
is a tale of a time
when some people would deem
traditions to be righteous
while others were unrighteous
and were stuck in the vortex
of anger, hatred and ambitions
thus leading to the destruction
of righteousness.
Back then, people loved others
but they lacked love
for the entire world.
There was no compassion
back then.
That is why, I
took an avatar.
Patranaya Sadhunam.
For the upliftment
of the good and virtuous.
Vinashaya Cha Dushkritam!
For the destruction of evil
and evil-doers!
Dharma Sansthapanarthaya!
For the re-establishment
of righteousness
I, Vasudeva Krishna,
am going to arrive
in the epic of Mahabharat!
What is your name?
Vrushali!
Even we'll accompany you!
- Even we'll come with you...
Take us along...
- Brother.
Even we'll accompany you,
Your Highness!
Let's take them along.
- Even we'll come...
A city is not just made
of bricks and mortar!
We also need people.
Even my friends
are coming along.
All hail, King Yudhisthir!
All hail, King Yudhisthir!
All hail, King Yudhisthir!
All hail, King Yudhisthir!
I am not at peace, uncle!
Why should I spare them
even a gravel of my land, uncle?
They are taking all
the subjects along with them.
Why worry, my child?
People from the neighbouring
provinces
will settle in Hastinapur.
I'll get people from Gandhar
and settle them here.
People will come
and settle in cities.
Keep your mind calm.
Concentrate on
the future plans, my child.
Think about your benefit!
Khandavprastha is barren!
Any human who ventures
into this land
is killed by
the serpent Takshak!
If Pandavas get killed by it,
then we benefit.
If the Pandavas kill Takshak
and
establish a city there
we'll benefit by that too!
How will that benefit us, uncle?
The cuckoo bird lays its eggs
in the crow's nest.
And when they hatch, the cuckoo
bird takes away the hatchlings.
The crow takes the pain
but the cuckoo stands to gain!
So consider that
Pandavas are toiling
in Khandavprastha for you!
If a city is established there
we'll snatch it
from the Pandavas!
Now even the ageing guardian
has been defeated, my child!
Mother!
I see myself surrounded
by just one question.
What sin have the ancestors
of the Kuru clan committed
which has caused their kingdom
to be bisected mercilessly?
What's the reason for it?
I am sure my question
is flawed, mother.
Else, why aren't you appearing
to eliminate my dilemma?
Tell me, mother.
Tell me!
Whose righteousness
is being slurred today?
Who has been defeated?
Who?
His Excellency Bhishma
will be defeated!
Who are you?
Who invited you
to come here
and manifest your might?
I have already accepted
King Shalva as my husband!
You have won me by displaying
your might, in the courtroom.
Now, I will be wedded
only to Bhishma.
But this is impossible.
I have vowed to live
a life of celibacy.
And I have come here to
get that vow revoked, Bhishma!
You will have to bear
a much graver pain
than the pain I had to bear
because of you.
Whenever you are associated
with a noble task
and you wish for
Bhishma's death.
You will definitely be
the cause of Bhishma's death.
If so, I don't want to live!
But I will take a rebirth.
And when the vagaries of age
would have worn you
and your soul, out
then I will come.
As your death!
As your death!
As your death!
Or shall I say that
His Excellency Bhishma
is defeated?
The kingdom, for whose greatness
you committed so many sins
today you had to bisect
that very kingdom!
You're repenting for the sins
you committed in your life,
Bhishma!
Had it been so, then I would've
definitely repented, today.
But all my acts in the past
have always stood on the
pedestal of righteousness, Amba.
I gave up my life, in my last
birth, because of you, Bhishma.
During my last moments
I had told you
The throne of Hastinapur, for
which you ruined my life
will make you struggle,
day in and day out!
That throne will never
let you be at peace!
You will struggle hard!
The throne will make you do so!
And even today,
you are struggling!
If you haven't sinned, then
why are you being punished?
This is the punishment
for loving my family.
No, Bhishma!
It's the punishment for
disregarding others
for your selfish love.
Your love for your family made
you disregard the whole world!
You forgot, Bhishma.
That a hive becomes
a curse for a queen bee!
It cannot free itself
from the hive!
It dies painfully in a hive
filled with nectar!
You will meet the same fate,
Bhishma!
Your punishment has
just commenced, Bhishma.
Your family will punish you!
Your sins shall strike you
like lethal arrows
and tear you apart, Bhishma!
You will lie on a bed of arrows
and squirm!
And upon seeing the slaughter
around you
you'll yearn for death,
Bhishma!
You'll yearn!
And I will be present there.
Like a predator crushes
its prey in its jaws
and kilIs it, brutally
likewise,
I shall witness death crushing
you mercilessly, Bhishma!
This is Khandavprastha.
Our new kingdom.
This is Khandavprastha.
How can people
settle down here?
I've heard that
the land of this place
was burnt down
by snake's poison.
No, friend. It is a result of
Lord Indra's fury.
Lord Indra has granted
the snake Takshak a boon
according to which, he won't
cause rainfall on this land.
The rains would be limited
till the woods over there.
I hope we haven't made
a mistake by coming here.
There's no way that we can
return to Hastinapur now.
You all have come here believing
the ability of Pandavas, right?
Why are you upset then?
If Lord Indra is on
Takshak's side
then we have on our side
the godson of Lord Indra
Arjun.
What do you mean?
Everyone knows that each
son of King Pandu
is part of some God.
Kind Pandu was granted
these sons as boon by Gods.
So that the land of the Kurus
can be saved.
Son of Kind Pandu, Arjun
is Lord Indra's blessing.
Hence, do not worry.
This land would certainly turn
out to be fruitful for Pandavas.
Is this the state?
There are more trees even
underneath the sea water.
Those who love land,
are loved back by it.
I firmly believe
that this land will bring about
our glory and prosperity.
Just that we need to
work a little hard for it.
Only the servants
are going to work hard.
What did you just say?
Your Highness,
please forgive me.
I didn't say anything.
Charioteer, please stop.
Why are you afraid,
Vrushali?
Come closer.
I'm not going to punish you.
What's the matter?
Why do you look
so worried and sad?
Your Highness, I...
I wasn't supposed to come here
but since father insisted...
Why weren't you supposed to
come here?
Don't be afraid, Vrushali.
No matter what your concerns
consider me as a friend
and tell me everything.
Actually...
Your Highness...
I like Hastinapur a lot,
Your Highness.
My friends, my home
and the amenities I desire...
Everything is over there.
Forsaking all that,
in this desolate place
why indeed have I come
to struggle for a life?
How would it benefit me?
You are here to contribute
to the making of a great empire.
It will be Duryodhan's reign
in Hastinapur
and here, it will be the Pandav
Yudhisthir's.
That empire will be yours.
Fame is found
only by the rulers.
The common folk
have mere struggles
in their fate, Your Highness.
That won't be the story here.
I assure you of that.
My husband will always be
righteous.
The empire won't be our property
rather it will be ruled as if
it were our heirloom.
All the rulers speak
of righteousness
but their righteousness
is only towards their families.
Speak of common folk
or ordinary people
and their sense of righteousness
becomes very stiff.
Be it the son of Dhritarashtra
or of Pandu
both are well alike,
Your Highness.
Your Highness,
if my words
amount to a death penalty
I would happily oblige.
Why would I sentence you
to death, friend?
Not only will we be fair
towards our subjects
but we'll also honour the right
of the serpents living here.
Just like different flavours
in food have their own place
all our subjects will have
their own rights and place.
Speaking of you...
You've taught me the definition
of an ideal empire.
You will never face any harm
or pain.
Takshak
the Pandavas
and their subjects are here.
Your Majesty, Prince Duryodhan
seeks your permission to enter.
Prince Duryodhan?
Leave!
What mistake did I make, Prince?
By seeking my permission
to enter
what could be
the reason for hurting me?
Get used to it, friend Karna.
No.
King of Anga, Karna.
Henceforth, I will always
have to seek your permission.
This is the tradition
of royal families.
You will be
senior to me by rank now.
I will always be junior to you
by rank, Prince.
A wheel is meant to travel
but when it is
joined to a chariot
it travels the whole world.
Otherwise
it just lies in the courtyard
of a potter
and is used to make
earthen pots.
I can never
forget the fact, Prince
that all this
prestige and respect
is being given to me
only because of you.
I will devote
the kingdom of Anga to you.
Only your kingdom?
It was never yours.
What else can you give me?
I can give you my life.
A warrior does not deem
his life valuable, King of Anga.
What else can you give me?
Why are you testing
my dedication, Prince?
The person I trusted the most
my own father is about to
renounce me, King of Anga!
Today, for the first time
in my life
I wish to test everyone.
What can you give me?
My mother and father
have already
been renounced by me for you.
Can you renounce righteousness?
Righteousness has always
been an obstacle in my life
King of Anga.
Can you renounce righteousness?
Renouncing righteousness has
never benefited anyone, Prince.
I have got my answer!
However
from this day forth
it will be my duty
to follow every order of yours.
Nothing else shall
lie above it for me.
We can declare a war
against Hastinapur, friend.
We can defeat the Pandavas
in the battle.
What decision have you made?
I have made my decision.
Attention everyone!
King Dhritarashtra
is making his entrance!
Yudhishthir.
- Greetings, uncle.
May you live long.
You should have called me.
Why did you take the pain of
coming to my chamber yourself?
Brother Arjun
I have a really bad feeling
regarding brother Yudhishthir.
You are the epitome
of righteousness.
Just think about it.
If Duryodhan revolts
against Hastinapur
what will be the duty of a King?
You will have to command an army
against Duryodhan.
And that army will be led by
the son of Ganga.
The son of Ganga, who
could not be defeated
even by Lord Parashuram.
Now, in this old age,
do I need to sacrifice my sons?
But Yudhishthir
a person who loses his sons
while he is alive
is left to face hell
before his death
and even after it.
What mistake did I make
that I am to suffer
such a fate, Yudhishthir?
What mistake did I make?
Give me the order, Your Majesty.
Not an order.
No...
Not even a wish.
Only...
It is only hope, dear.
The hope that you will
help your uncle
get over this pain.
To declare you the Crowned
Prince of Hastinapur is my duty.
It is my duty.
But dear
to take a decision that will
make your uncle happy
is also your duty, is it not?
If you yourself
give up your position
as Prince to Duryodhan then...
Then I will not only
perform my duty
but also regain my happiness.
Decide after
meditating over it, dear.
Decide after
meditating over it, dear.
Even Arjun and Sahadev are here.
Take into account
their suggestions as well.
There is no question
of meditating over it, uncle.
Every word uttered by you
is an order
to brother Yudhishthir.
It is an order
to all us brothers.
With your permission
I would like to
clarify a doubt, uncle.
Go ahead.
When the Monsoons begin
the King is the first
to till the land.
This is termed as 'Seet Yajna.
I never quite understood
its meaning, uncle.
This is not the time to discuss
the 'Shastras,' Arjun.
Still, I will
answer your question.
When tilling the land
a farmer commits the sin
of killing many animals.
By performing the 'Seet Yajna,
the King
acquires all the sins
of the farmer.
This is the reason why
every King after his death
even for a short period
spends time in hell, Arjun.
Then why does a King
commit a deed
that sends him to hell?
Dear
if a farmer renounces farming
out of the fear of hell
then the entire society
will go hungry.
And it is the duty
of a King to...
Can a King
not assign another person
to the 'Seet Yajna
and save himself from hell?
Can the rules of righteousness
not be bent?
Yudhishthir
tomorrow at dawn
you will be anointed as
the Crowned Prince in the court.
Here you go, brother.
Sister-in-law
why did you have
these apparels sent to me?
To examine them.
When your son
will be crowned the Prince
one among these apparels
will be placed on his shoulder.
You can choose any you like.
But sister-in-law, this right
belongs to the Queen.
But my eyes are covered.
You are more suited
to this task than me, Kunti.
The question is not about rights
but worthiness.
Sister-in-law, is the victory
of the Princes
making you unhappy?
Kunti, the victory of your sons
does not make me unhappy.
But the defeat of my sons
is certainly causing me pain.
If you want
Duryodhan to be
the Crowned Prince...
No, Kunti.
I am the Queen.
For the welfare of the kingdom
I will do everything
required of me.
But
I am also a mother.
The ambition of my son
will go unfulfilled
and I have the right
to grieve over it.
Let's go, Kunti.
It is almost time for the
anointing of the Crowned Prince.
Why do I feel as though
because of this, you
and I are becoming distant?
When we had
unhappiness in our lives
you and I were close.
Now, you have been blessed
with happiness, Kunti.
Unhappiness brings people close.
And happiness
makes people distant.
Greetings, Your Majesty!
Greetings, grandfather!
May you live long.
Greetings, uncle!
- Bless you.
Greetings, teacher!
- May you live long.
Om Bhur Bhuvah Svah
Tat Savitur Vareniyam
Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi
Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayat.
Om Bhur Bhuvah Svah
Tat Savitur Vareniyam
Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi
Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayat.
Be seated.
Duryodhan will indeed
be punished for his sins.
This is the curse
of Yajnaseni Draupadi!
If your sons have
renounced the Almighty
and embraced opulence
then they are bound
to be slain, Your Highness.
Emperor Dhritarashtra of Kuru,
all your sons will die
at my hands!
I will rip open Dusshasan's
chest and drink his blood!
The day my sons
gain independence
it will be the end
of all your happiness!
This is the beginning of a war,
King Dhritarashtra.
There will be a blood bath!
There will be a blood bath!
This is the beginning
of Mahabharat!
The day my sons
gain independence
it will be the end
of all your happiness!
No...
- 'There will be a blood bath!
Father!
Father, save me!
Duryodhan!
My Lord!
My Lord
are you alright?
My Lord...
Bheem, please do not drink
the blood from my chest!
Bheem, please do not drink
the blood from my chest!
Duryodhan, I have killed
99 of your brothers!
Now, I will kill
you as well!
Brother Bheem,
please do not kill me.
Father,
please save me!
How will that blind man
save you, Vikarna?!
All your brothers
will die at my hands!
I will kill all you brothers!
- Bheem, do not kill me!
I have killed ninety nine...
- Father, save me!
I will kill you as well!
- Father!
Do not drink my blood...
No!
I will kill all you brothers!
Brother.
Vidur! Vidur,
stop these cries!
Vidur, stop these cries!
- Brother Dhritarashtra.
Stop these cries, Vidur!
- Brother Dhritarashtra!
Calm down.
Calm down.
Those cries are merely
a figment of your imagination.
However, very soon
those screams
will be heard
from the battlefield.
Vidur...
Vidur,
save my sons!
Save my sons,
Vidur!
I can hear their screams
when I am asleep
and I am tormented
by the thought of their death
in my waking hours,
Vidur!
It seems as though...
It seems as though
someone is chopping off
the parts of my body
one by one, Vidur!
Someone is chopping off
the parts of my body!
I am in great agony,
Vidur!
I am in great agony!
You will indeed
be in agony, brother.
You had derived joy
from someone's agony, remember?
The possibility of their joy
will indeed be agonizing now.
Do remember.
The one to build an embankment
on a river does derive joy
but along with it,
one also gets surrounded by fear
because when
that embankment breaks
the river that gave life
to various cities
drowns them in its waters,
brother.
The embankment of treachery
made on the Pandavas' competence
has finally broken,
brother.
It will drown all your sons.
It will drown your sons.
Be quiet,
Vidur!
Be quiet,
Vidur!
Be quiet!
Be quiet.
If you utter another word
about the death of my sons
then I will crush you
to death this instant, Vidur!
I will kill you!
I am bound to die,
brother.
Merely breathing the air
does not denote life.
When the heart is robbed of joy
and the soul is robbed of hope
it is called death,
brother.
With this war
the prosperity of the Kuru
kingdom will be destroyed.
Millions of young men will die.
I have dedicated my entire life
to this kingdom.
When it will be
left impoverished
I will be as good as dead,
brother.
You too shall experience
this terrible ordeal.
No, Vidur...
My younger brother.
My beloved brother.
Please show me a way
out of this dreadful situation,
Vidur.
Please show me a way!
Even if we seek the refuge
of the Pandavas
they will punish my sons
by sentencing
them to death,
Vidur!
The Pandavas will punish
my sons by sentencing
them to death.
No, they will not.
I have faith that they will not.
Return the Pandavas
their property
and apologize to them.
Even during the horrific
moments of the game of dice
when the Pandavas did not
forsake righteousness
they will not do so
now either, brother.
No matter in what form
the Holy Basil is consumed
it does not forsake
its medicinal properties.
The Pandavas will not forsake
righteousness now either.
Your sons must touch
Draupadi's feet
and apologize
brother.
They must atone for their sins
and accept
the punishment as well.
One thing is clear,
brother.
Your sons can be saved
only by Draupadi now.
Sister-in-law!
Come and sit,
Subhadra.
Do you know?
It is a tradition
of the Kuru Royal Family
where the mother
ties a protection amulet
on her son before marriage.
Look at this.
I have made this
protection amulet for Abhimanyu.
These five stones
were given to me by Govind.
These five stones represent
the five sons of Pandu.
I know,
sister-in-law.
Brother had asked me once
to take these to My Lord.
The protection of
all five of his fathers will be
with Abhimanyu with its help.
Where is Abhimanyu?
He is in his chamber
with My Lord.
He is getting dressed
for the marriage.
Sister-in-law
you should tie this
on Abhimanyu's arm.
Me?
But why me, Subhadra?
This is...
Because the mantra of his life
is to avenge your insult.
The right to offer him
protection is yours
and even the strength
to do so resides in you.
Instead of wearing an armour
why am I adorning
these ornaments, father?
Madhav was correct.
When a warrior goes to battle
with the hope of a better life
he meets with success.
King Virat has protected us.
By forging familial ties
with him
we are honouring him.
But if uncle
and Mother Draupadi say
that I cannot go to battle
right after the marriage
then I will have to
disobey them.
When all of you
will be going for the battle
and my brothers will be showing
valour in the battlefield
with weapons in their hands
I will not be able to stay
away from the battlefield.
I promise you
that I will not stop you
from going for the battle.
However,
if either
you or your brothers
are harmed in the battle
then even after the death
of the hundred Kauravas
we will be the ones
to be defeated.
That is why, in the battlefield
you will do no such thing
which is not required.
I will make
no such promise, mother.
I can make only one promise
that I will follow every order
of father Yudhishthir.
That would be adequate.
All five of your fathers
will protect you.
With this protection amulet
I shall bind all the sons
of Pandu to a cause.
The responsibility
of your safety
will now be theirs.
May you live long!
Do not place the weight
of my safety on the shoulders
of my fathers, Mother Draupadi.
Their shoulders have the weight
of protecting righteousness.
You need not worry,
mother.
I will string these stones
together and wear it on my arm.
As long as a son has
the protection of his mother
he cannot be defeated.
Besides,
I have...
I have two mothers.
Did you call for me,
mother?
Son Duryodhan
do you see these lamps?
These hundred lamps
represent the lives
of the hundred sons of mine.
Kunti has lit them
and
fate will extinguish them.
Mother
all our lives get extinguished
by nothing but fate.
No, son.
The lives of my sons
will be extinguished
in the battlefield.
This is the curse of Kunti
and the curse of a heart
tormented by injustice
can never be futile.
These things mean nothing,
mother.
In order to scare you
those Pandavas have come up
with this contraption.
If I extinguish
any one of the lamps
this instant
then, will
one of my brothers die?
Then here you go,
mother.
If the first lamp
represents my life
then I shall extinguish it
this instant.
It did not get extinguished,
did it?
These lamps will be extinguished
only in the battlefield, son.
Son, I called you here
only to let you know about it.
Quit the thought of a battle
and apologize to Draupadi.
Return them
their property, son.
Please save yourselves.
- Impossible, mother.
Impossible.
Man's life does not hold
more value than his pride.
The Pandavas had insulted me
in the court of Indraprastha.
My revenge
will be complete only with
the death of those Pandavas!
Son...
Son Duryodhan
just think once about
the situation your father is in.
His heart
is exceedingly agitated.
The uncertainties of the future
keep him awake all night.
Duryodhan
just look at the sadness
of your mother.
A mother who loses her sons
experiences the agony
of the bite
of a hundred serpents.
Her life becomes hell.
Even death does not embrace her.
Then tell Queen Mother Kunti
to be prepared
to experience such agony
because the ones to die
in the battlefield
will be the Pandavas!
They will die at my hands.
Mother
do not let such illusory lamps
scare you.
I do not believe
in these things.
If lighting and
extinguishing such lamps
could affect the life
and death of man
then all the people
who make lamps in this world
would be made to sit
in a temple.
In this war
I will emerge victorious.
I shall become the Emperor
of this land!
In other words, in three days
from now will begin
the Mahabharat.
And very soon
the sons of Pandu
will meet their doom
in this very battlefield.
The Kurukshetra
after all these years
will be satiated by drinking
the blood of my enemies.
Crown Prince
who can ever know
the result of a war?
I know,
Vasudev.
You may be a great trickster
but I have unparalleled might
fighting from my side.
Take a good look at us.
General Bhishma
who has been blessed
with the boon to die at will.
Guru Drona, who cannot
be slain by anyone.
My friend Maharathi Karna
whose armour can withstand
the blow of any weapon.
When a side has
three exceptional warriors
who cannot be slain
how can that side ever meet
with defeat, Vasudev?
Crown Prince Duryodhan!
The answer to your friend Karna
is Prince Arjun.
The armour of Maharathi Karna
can certainly withstand
the blow of many weapons
but not that of the Gandiva Bow
of Prince Arjun.
My brother Dhrishtadyumna
was born to slay Guru Drona.
And His Excellency Bhishma
has made me a promise
that whenever I confront him
in a battlefield
he will not resort to arms!
And what will your role be
in this battlefield
Princess Shikhandini?
As the General of the army of
the Pandavas, King of Gandhar.
In other words,
on the very first day of the war
your General,
His Excellency Bhishma
will be stripped of his weapons.
Am I correct,
Your Excellency Bhishma?!
You are correct,
Princess Shikhandini.
Uncle
did you know that
grandsire would never take to
arms before Drupad's daughter?
Yes,
my darling.
The entire Aryan region
resonates of such tales.
In other words, on the
very first day of the war
will the General of my army
refuse to take to arms?
So, will we get defeated
even before the war begins,
uncle?
My darling
before a war begins
in the battlefield
one needs to come up
with certain plans.
This war is not yours,
my darling.
The truth is
this war
is between me
and Vasudev Krishna.
This is a web of treachery
woven by him.
That is why,
a woman
has been made the General.
However, the ethics
and rules of this war
are yet to be discussed
by both the sides.
The war will begin
after three days.
However, in order to change
the circumstances
I require merely three moments.
Only three moments.
Do not worry,
my darling.
Righteousness will aid you
win this war.
Righteousness?
How can righteousness
aid me win this war, uncle?
The righteousness of
Yudhishthir, the son of Pandu
will aid you win this war.
You.
Three days before the war.
Uncle Shakuni
will weave another web
of treachery, My Lords.
The ethics of the war
are yet to be discussed.
He will certainly use treachery
in the discussion
and use it to their advantage.
Do not worry,
Panchali.
Uncle has never had
any faith in wars.
He has always used treachery
to avert a war.
In a war,
his mind stops working
before cowards give up fighting.
But right before a war
in order to protect oneself
even the mind of cowards
becomes quite sharp.
Panchali's fear is not baseless.
Uncle will certainly weave
a web of treachery.
But this time,
we will not get caught in it
brother Yudhishthir.
Even if the question
of righteousness arises
we will not get caught in it,
brother Yudhishthir.
Righteousness is not a tie,
Sahadev.
Righteousness is
the other term for liberation.
When it comes to righteousness
one cannot compromise with it.
Only copper
turns green,
yellow
and white under
different circumstances.
However, gold does not
change its colour.
That is why,
gold is so precious.
Let's go.
It is time for the discussion.
Greetings, Vasudev.
Greetings.
Greetings,
Your Excellency Bhishma.
Greetings.
In the entire Aryan region
the rules of a war
have already been defined.
However, in the discussions
held before a war
those rules are merely
recollected by everyone
so that no person
in either of the sides
has a doubt in his heart.
With the permission
of everyone present here
I wish to put forth
these rules before all
in this session.
Certainly.
Thank you.
It is a tradition
of the Aryan region
that a war begins at dawn
and ends at dusk.
However,
dusk or sundown
shall not be deemed
the end of the day.
Only when it is
impossible to see
in the absence of torches
will it be deemed
the end of the day.
Impossible!
It is deemed the end of the day
when the sunrays
are no longer visible.
The argument over
precisely that point
has given rise to this war,
brother Bheem.
Regarding this point
our decision is crystal clear.
We accept your first rule,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.
But do remember...
If the inability to see
marks the end of a day
then you may stop
fighting for that day
but I shall continue fighting.
If the inability to see
marks the end of a day
then you may stop
fighting for that day
but I shall continue fighting.
I can shoot arrows
even in complete darkness.
You have seen it,
have you not?
Then I suggest
that dawn and dusk
should be determined
by the sound of a conch shell.
The Maharathis
of both the armies
shall begin and end the day
by sounding a conch shell.
That sounds fair,
Your Excellency Bhishma.
We have firm faith
in your justice.
My darling...
Your Excellency...
Let us discuss the rest
of the rules as well, Vasudev.
Only one warrior shall fight
with another warrior.
Each warrior shall fight
with a warrior of his category.
A warrior who is
injured, defenseless
or has come to seek shelter
shall not be harmed by anyone.
People who serve
and treat other people
shall not be harmed by anyone.
A warrior who is not present
in the battlefield
shall also not be harmed
by anyone.
A warrior who breaks these rules
shall be sentenced to death
by the General of that warrior.
Since these rules are in
accordance with the traditions
there is no scope
for any argument.
Splendid.
Marvellous.
Now, before ending
this session
I wish to ask one last question.
Vasudev Krishna has
called this region
a righteous one.
So, will all the warriors
participating in this war
act righteously?
Indeed.
Splendid.
Marvellous.
In other words
we have decided
that each warrior
will fight with a warrior
of the same category.
A warrior proficient in archery
will not challenge a warrior
proficient in mace-fighting.
A Maharathi
cannot challenge
a Commander.
However
according to the 'shastras
and traditions
even the categories
of men and women
are deemed to be different.
If a woman is a mother,
she is revered.
If she is a wife,
she is dear.
If she is a daughter,
she is one's good fortune.
If she is a daughter-in-law,
she is worthy of respect.
Even when one has
an argument with a woman
striking at a woman
is like paving one's way
straight to hell.
In order to appease Maha Kali
Lord Shiva
had lied down defenseless
in the path of the Goddess.
However, He did not employ
might against the Goddess.
So, even when a woman
takes to arms in the battlefield
can any man
ever strike at her?
Only a woman
can fight against another...
So, would it not be correct
to come up with such a rule?
Yudhishthir,
son of Pandu
you are the most
knowledgeable person
when it comes to righteousness.
If you say that in this war
it is appropriate
to strike at a woman
then you would be doing
an unrighteous deed.
And if you say
that it is inappropriate
to strike at a woman
then you would be
making this war
an unrighteous one.
What kind of a question is that?
When I have given everyone
the freedom to strike at me
how does righteousness
come into the picture?
Righteousness and traditions
do not function according to the
will of a single person, Lady.
Yudhishthir,
son of Pandu...
So, what does your
righteousness say?
Have you thought of defeating us
even without engaging in a war?
Because when confronted
with your General
no warrior from our army
will strike at her.
You have upheld righteousness
all your life.
So, in order to be victorious
will you let go
of your righteous ways?
Women will not be able
to participate in this war.
We accept it.
We accept it.
I had told you,
my darling...
The righteousness of Yudhishthir
will become the reason
of your victory.
Your Grace, the minister
has sent this gift for you.
What is this, liege?
- This is a bag of rice.
Did he not send jaggery
and clarified butter along?
I could have made an excellent
Kheer' if he did.
If you soak the rice overnight,
and fry it in the butter
in the morning and
then add jaggery to it
it makes for an excellent
Kheer', mother.
Hah! There was a rat
in the bag of rice.
Bhima's 'Kheer' became
impure even before it was made.
Nothing becomes impure
because of an innocent creature,
Sahadev.
Only man can make things impure,
with his deeds.
But
why did uncle send
this rat as a gift?
I don't think he meant
to send us a rat.
The rat must have
stumbled into the bag.
Yes.
I'm sure that rice is not
readily available here
hence, this was sent from
Hastinapur, for the princes.
Is there anything else, leige?
Please keep this is mind,
Your Grace
that even if one grain of
rice falls to the ground
it can manifest itself in
hundreds, in the future.
I take your leave, Your Grace.
Your Highness.
Even if one grain of
rice falls to the ground
it can manifest itself in
hundreds, in the future.
My child.
Are you looking at this moon?
It was full moon,
some nights past
How luminous it was.
And now, only a part of
its luminousity remains.
Tomorrow,
even this, would be lost.
For tomorrow, is the
night, of the new moon.
Just this way, the luminousity
from lives of the Pandavas
will be extinguished tomorrow.
Uncle, Lord Ram was
victorious on new moon
and the whole world celebrates
that night as 'Diwali'.*
*The "festival of lights", spiritually signifies victory.
The new moon, tomorrow
will be a 'Diwali
for us as well.
Of course, my child, of course.
But, only if your friend, Karna
doesn't put a
spanner to the works.
Only then, will all our wishes
come to fruition.
Uncle,
I have complete faith in Karna.
My child.
If you have faith in him
than I have nothing
to worry about.
For tomorrow
Purochana will set the
Lakshagraha' on fire.
Now, there is no escape,
for your enemies.
No one can save them.
Greetings, Your Grace.
Adhiratha,
your charioteer, is here.
Adhiratha? At this time?
Send him in.
- Yes, Your Grace.
What's the matter, Adhirath?
You don't even
bow before me now.
Leave us!
I need to be pure myself
before I bow before you.
I feel
very unclean today.
My soul is stained.
I don't have the right
to bow before you.
I'm here to tell you
that I wish to leave
your services
and Hastinapur.
It's the lay of the land,
Adhiratha
that, a boy endures pain,
because of his friends
an adolescent,
for his lover
a married man,
for his in-laws
and an old man
for his children.
There is no such unction,
which can allay this pain.
I'm certain that
your son is the cause
of your pain, Adhiratha.
Tell me the truth, Adhiratha.
What has your son done?
Don't be silent.
I'm waiting.
Your Grace, Karna is innocent.
If that's true,
then your sorrow is unfounded
Tell me the truth, Adhiratha.
How has Karna hurt you?
Your Grace,
he is bound by
his pledge of friendship.
He hasn't said anything clearly.
But something is amiss
at Varnavart.
Something will come to
pass with the Pandavas
which will be an iniquity,
for even Karna.
But something is amiss
at Varnavart.
Something will come to
pass with the Pandavas
which will be an iniquity,
for even Karna.
And I will not let
that iniquity happen.
Krishna shaved Rukmi's
head with his discus.
Now he won't try to make
alliances with Dwarka.
What's wrong, brother?
Not worried. I was wondering
why uncle sent a rat.
What is he trying to tell us?
I'm sure he's trying
to tell Nakula
that no matter how much
he stand there with the rat
in front of the mirror
he won't be any beautiful.
Leave the mirror alone.
Don't you get tired,
looking at yourself.
What's there to get tired,
brother?
Even you look at yourself in the
mirror, when you have the time.
I look at my arms.
Yes,
one looks at what he possesses.
Now your face is
nothing to look at.
Arjuna face was worth looking at
when he dressed up as a girl.
Our mother will be
saddened to know that
the strongest man in the world
is reduced to being a mere cook.
Just like a beautiful and
graceful wife.
Arjuna!
Bhima! Bhima! Bhima!
Bhima!
Bhima
Bhima, go and see whether
the food is cooked or not.
Even you, brother!
It's nothing like that.
It's time to eat,
that's why I asked you.
Go.
- Come, Sahadeva.
Go, Bhima.
Cook the food.
Uncle.
Brother! Brother!
Grand uncle Bhishma has left
for Varnavart, in a hurry.
How did grand uncle
come to know of this?
The biggest of ships are sunk
because of one hole
in its starboard.
Even your plan has a hole.
Your friend.
I can't believe that
Karna has left our side
and has gone to help
those Pandavas, uncle.
No, this cannot be.
My child, I never said
that he has left your side.
But he can't let go of
his principles as well.
This is his deference.
I'm sure the pain in his heart
is reflecting on
his countenance.
But there is no reason
for alarm.
What has to happen tomorrow
can happen tonight as well.
It seems that Pandavas' lives
are about to be eclipsed.
But how will that happen, uncle?
If we send word to Purochana
then grand uncle will also
come to know of it.
I never found Hastinapur's
traditional ways
of sending messages
to be proper.
The message should
reach discreetly.
Shukra!
My friend.
Will you take a message
to Varnavart?
You have to make haste
because Duryodhana's ill luck
and 'Lakshagraha
need to be burnt to ashes.
Write the message, my child.
Write the message.
A message from Shakuni?
Brundhari, I have just recieved
word from Shakuni.
We have to set the
mansion on fire tonight.
Alright, child.
Do this.
There is a person
at the stables
who goes by the name of Dhamgranthi.*
*"Abode of a relater/narrator/chanter."
Go and give this 'laddoo' to him.
Go and give it to him.
Go on.
Dhamgranthi.
Dhamgranthi.
Are you Dhamgranthi?
He is.
But Tantripal told me
that Dhamgranthi is a person.
Tantripal has sent
a gram flour 'laddoo'.
Wonderful!
I was wondering
when the 'laddoo' will arrive.
You may have it.
- Won't you have it?
If I have it,
I will gain weight
and become ugly like you.
Have it.
Even Minister Kank
loves these sweets.
Has chef Ballav
sent him 'laddoo'?
How would I know that?
Your Highness, we have brought
food for you.
Gram flour 'laddoo'!
Who had the audacity
to send me these sweets?
Your Highness,
if you permit me
may I have the 'laddoo'?
I am reminded of my childhood
while having them.
Of course.
You have made my kingdom
prosper so much.
Not just a portion
of my food
you may even ask for a portion
of my kingdom.
Attendant, keep the food here.
We will have it later.
Your Highness
you seem to be distracted today.
Minister Kank
my subjects are very upset
over General Keechak's conduct.
But he is the Queen's brother.
Hence, I can't control him.
General Keechak is the strength
of our kingdom.
The basis of our protection.
A tortoise's shell becomes
a burden for its whole body
because
its shell is its
only protection.
Meaning?
Your Highness
a wise king does not depend
on a single source of protection
for his kingdom.
He divides the responsibilities
among several people.
Even you need to do that.
Attendant
has the same food been sent
to the Queen's chamber?
Yes, sire.
Enough. I cannot dance any more, Brihannala.*
*"Large reed" or "having a reed."
I am tired.
You got tired so soon,
Uttara!
How will you grow strong
by learning to dance?
Train yourself in warfare.
Only then
will you become strong.
Alright, Uttar.
If you are that strong
prove it by dancing.
I am a warrior.
I don't dance.
Knowledge of dance
even helps in warfare, Prince.
Dance in warfare!
Definitely.
Raise your sword
and try to injure me.
Then, watch the miracle
called dancing.
Prince
in life, dance is equally
important in times
of struggle and peace.
Remember.
If the joyful 'Tandav'* of Lord Shiva gives life
*Divine dance performed by Shiva.
then the terrible 'Tandav
takes it away as well.
Gram flour 'laddoo'?
Why do we have these sweets
for our meals repeatedly?
Take them away.
Your Highness
if you permit me
I wish to visit the town
for a while.
Of course.
Princess Uttara
will rest now.
Malini*
*"Having a garland."
have you finished
adorning my hair?
Yes, Your Highness.
Where are you going?
Your Highness
Today I am observing a fast called 'Yaksh Poojan'.*
*Worship of Yaksh/benevolent nature spirits.
And the sun is about to set.
If you permit me..
May I offer the prayers?
Wait for a while.
First, take this vessel
containing liquor
to my elder brother's house.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
But
But I am an expert maid.
My duty is to style your hair.
I can't undertake the task
meant for servants.
No one refuses to obey General
Keechak's order in Kingdom of Matsya.
You are under the protection
of Minister Kank.
And for some reason,
the King is very fond of him.
I am aware of that as well.
But if my brother
gets angry with you
he will have you burnt alive.
No one will be able
to protect you.
Take this and deliver it
to his house.
Right now.
Brother Bheem
is there any reason
behind sending the 'laddoo'?
I was very eager
to see your ugly face.
But, brother Bheem
elder brother had told us
that unless
it is something serious
you should not send any message
through 'laddoo'.
But there is a serious problem.
Your waist has become
very narrow, Brihannala.
Eat the food that I prepare
and become strong
as one needs to be strong enough
to face a battle.
Did Panchali not receive
my message, Arjun?
She is the only one
who is yet to arrive.
We had seen the gram flour
laddoo' together brother Bheem.
But I think
the Queen stopped her
and gave her some task.
Bring that vessel here.
Forgive me.
I might stumble in the dark.
Let me light up the chamber.
Now, remove this veil,
expert maid.
Otherwise, you will get burnt.
I have already told you,
General Keechak.
I am under the protection
of the immortal Gandharvas.
Fire, poison or weapons
cannot harm me.
But yes.
You should definitely
worry about your well being.
Words spoken behind a veil
echo
and I hear those words
several times.
The results of your sins
will be such
that you will be punished
several times over.
Who are you?
You seem to be from
some royal family.
Such beauty
can be found only among royalty.
Beauty and character are not
bound by any caste or creed.
They can be found anywhere.
And I never lift my veil.
You have not seen
my beauty at all.
I have.
Once, at Sudeshna's palace
I had seen your
beautiful face.
I am enchanted
by your beauty.
I am even ready
to marry you.
I am already married,
General Keechak.
If your husband is alive
then why do you
leave your hair untied?
My husband has taken a vow
of extreme penance
to finish all the sinners
in this world.
I leave my hair untied
at his orders.
Move out of my way.
Foolish maid
if you reject
General Keechak's love
then I will force you
to surrender to me.
The one who touched my clothes
will die a horrific death.
God Himself has granted
this boon to me.
You have made
a very big mistake
by touching my clothes.
Then call your protectors
and save yourself.
I had told you
that I am under the protection
of five immortal Gandharvas.
No one can touch me
against my will.
Listen to me.
While you are under the protection
of the great King Virat
don't indulge in such sins,
Keechak.
Before the serpents residing
under the ground
the ones clinging to the
sandalwood trees have to die.
You will have to die,
in the same manner.
I am grateful to Queen Sudeshna
for giving me food and shelter.
Hence, I am forgiving you
this time.
Very soon, I'll uncover
your secret.
And that day
you will voluntarily
have to come to me,
for protection.
Yes!
Treating women in this manner
is not correct.
Their powers ought to be
duly honoured.
Why do you not apologize
to His Highness, Princess?
At times like this, I always
apologize to my father.
I will apologize to him.
I have insulted
father unknowingly.
I shall indeed apologize to him.
But before that I will prove
that women do not belong
on the bottom rung.
But you are all alone, Princess.
How will you achieve this?
Who will aid you?
Do you intend to jump
into the water
or are you waiting for it
to jump on you?
Pardon me.
I could not contain
my curiosity.
You seem like a Princess
from your apparels.
Did you steal those apparels
and jewellery from Kampilya?
I merely wish to know
because the city of Kampilya
and all its wealth
belong to me for I am
its ruler now.
If you have stolen the apparels
and jewellery from Kampilya
then do return them
otherwise
you shall be punished.
Who are you?
And since when does
Kampilya belong to you?
Me?
I am Krishna Vasudev.
I am about to win
the city of Kampilya
and make all its wealth mine.
Will
you fight by yourself?
How can anyone
possibly fight by oneself?
There must be an opponent
to fight with.
I am about to fight
the King of Kampilya
Drupad
and his entire army.
Let's see who braves my Kaumodaki mace*
*Vishnu's power to destroy materialistic or demonic tendencies (Anarthas) that prevent people from reaching god.
in the battle.
All hail King Drupad!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
- March forth!
Drupad
where is your son?
When I heard that you performed
a 'yajna' to have a son
I decided to come here
to bless him.
My son has not been born
to seek your blessings, Drona!
He has been born to slay you!
I know.
In order to slay me
you have asked for a son
from the Gods.
But for how long will this
reciprocal tradition of insult
and revenge be continued by us?
Extinguish the fire burning
within your heart now, Drupad.
Did you get scared,
great warrior Drona?
I have not come here
bearing fear in my heart.
I have nothing but true love
in my heart
and I wish to bless your son.
After insulting a person,
showering love is easy, Drona.
Had you forgotten
how you were insulted
I would have had faith
in your love.
But you defeated me.
You defeated me!
You took half
the kingdom from me!
If you like, I can return you
your kingdom this instant
because even today,
I want your friendship
and not your kingdom.
It is too late, Drona!
You are a 'Brahmin!
You can receive charity!
But I am a 'Kshatriya!
I will never accept charity!
I must now be victorious, Drona!
I must now be victorious!
If I draw my weapon, your
entire army will be destroyed.
But I shall not draw
a weapon on your son.
You did not deem me your friend.
But I still deem you my friend
and your son like mine.
I bless him that may
all his wishes come true.
Dhrishtadyumna
your enemy is
right in front of you!
What are you waiting for?!
Draw your weapon!
I will not draw
my weapon, Drupad.
Your son has been
born to slay me.
So, allow him
to fulfill the purpose
of his life this instant.
Draw your weapon,
Dhrishtadyumna.
Who are you?!
Who am I?
A fish living in the ocean
cannot possibly know it,
King Drupad.
That is why, do not ask
unnecessary questions.
All you need to know is that I
shall not let you commit
an unrighteous deed.
Unrighteous? Who gave you
the right to decide upon
what is righteous
and what is unrighteous?!
One needs guidance of the soul
to decide upon righteousness.
There is no requirement
of any right, King Drupad.
Had you looked within yourself
you too would have known
what righteousness is.
Greetings, guru Drona.
Greetings, Krishna Vasudev.
Guru Drona has
approached you with amity.
He has even refused
to draw his weapons.
You cannot slay him now,
King Drupad.
Will you protect Drona?
I shall also protect you,
King Drupad
but only if you give up
your unrighteous ways.
Soldiers!
Annihilate that arrogant man!
Do not be foolish, Drupad.
Listen to Krishna Vasudev
and accept my friendship.
- Be quiet, Drona!
Dhrishtadyumna, attack!
If this is what you want,
King Drupad
then do attack.
Attack!
I had told you to give up
your unrighteous ways
and that I would
protect you then.
But you are oblivious
to righteousness, King Drupad.
Now, I must slay you.
Father..
Allow me to leave.
Teacher!
Every word uttered by my teacher
is an order to me!
I take the oath
that you will have
either Drupad at your feet
or my severed head
in your hands!
Arjun
your vow shall
indeed be fulfilled
but at my hands.
Father, His Highness
give the order
to launch an attack.
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty.
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!
Drupad.
The Region of Arya.
North, North-East,
East, South-East
South, South-West,
West, North-West.
Vidarbh, Kunti, Hastinapur.
Ganges,
Panchal - City of Kampilya.
Where is King Drupad?
Land is life.
From land originates life.
Land is life.
From land originates life.
Land is life.
From land originates life.
What news do you bring,
messenger?
All hail King Drupad.
Your Majesty, Dronacharya
has sent the message
that he is getting ready
to attack Panchal very soon.
He had attempted to usurp
only nine miles of my land!
And with these hands of mine
I buried him in the land here!
A person who eyes
the land of Panchal
does not have the right
to reside here.
Messenger
go and send Drona the message
that a stone which is
cast at the ocean
lands directly
in the Netherworld!
Cover his body with soil.
Prince Dusshasan.
Yes.
- Pay attention, friend.
While sharpening the swords,
make sure the soldiers
do not file them too much else
the shaft will lose its weight.
Certainly, King of Anga.
Prince Vikarna.
Make sure the shafts
of the swords and arrows
are as small as possible.
- Alright.
Otherwise they won't travel far.
- Certainly, King of Anga.
Carry them away properly.
I do not require
such a heavy armour.
Go and give it to the Pandavas.
The armour of
my friend Duryodhan
is me.
- In other words, I have
the best armour in the world
friend Karna.
- Undoubtedly, friend.
By agreeing to take part
in this war
you have magnified
my self-confidence, friend.
I was waiting for you.
We must go to my uncle now
to chalk out the strategies
for the war.
Let's proceed.
- Alright.
What is he doing?
Bheem!
What are you doing?
Oh!
Brother Duryodhan!
Do you wish to have your idol
built on the shoulders of mine?
So, I thought of coming here
and seeing how much it weighs.
If it is not too heavy,
I can hold it in my hands.
May I have a look?
It broke.
I am certain that while
making the idol, the sculptor
must have used arrogance
and not self-confidence.
They might look similar
but are vastly different.
Now, pray to the Almighty,
beloved brother Duryodhan
that may your capability
be stronger than your idol.
Do remember.
Drupad will
not go this easy on you.
Careful!
Do not step on
those illusory circles
else you will land
in the Netherworld.
From there.
Hey!
Not there!
There.
Now, to your left.
No!
Careful!
Careful.
Now, come from that way.
And now, from there.
This way.
What were you doing?
Teaching you how to dance.
You dance quite well.
In other words,
these are not illusory circles?
No.
I was devising formations
for the war.
I was meditating
on how to create them
and how to navigate
through them.
What is this?
Discus formation.
Could you explain it to me?
It is not your cup of tea.
It will bore you.
My brother Krishna says,
only a person who is afraid
devises an Illusory Labyrinth
but only an able person
can navigate through it.
Does your brother Krishna deem
himself highly knowledgeable?
No. Other people deem him
highly knowledgeable.
What brings you here?
I wanted to ask you the name
of the melody you had played
the other day.
Why?
- It was beautiful.
It is still resonating
in my ears.
It was a very soothing melody
at least, to me.
It was more like war music
than a soothing melody.
Uh!
It is not always necessary
for a melody to be soothing.
Sometimes, the psyche
of a person deems it so.
Were you thinking of a lad
you are in love with?
Is that all?
Do you not wish to learn
war music for your love?
Brother Krishna has
sent this for you.
What is it?
I do not know.
Brother Krishna said,
if you keep this with you
it will be of use to you.
Listen.
- Yes.
Are you going to be
at the front of the army?
Certainly.
I shall be at the front.
At the very front.
I shall indeed be at the front.
Sons
while filling a bowl
with a liquid
ensure that it is
properly filled
and that nothing spills over.
Mother, we shall ensure that our
valour pleases Dronacharya.
Have faith.
Our strength
will not be used to torture the
Panchal army or King Drupad.
May you be victorious!
Goodbye, mother.
May you be victorious!
Goodbye, father.
My son
I could not keep the promise
I made to you.
This is what
I was afraid of, father.
You fail to grasp the tricks
of grandfather and the Minister
because you are
a righteous man.
Uncle often says
that a righteous person
can be treated
quite unrighteously.
I have something more to say.
Your grandfather Bhishma
is reminded of righteousness
only when
he has to resort to
something unrighteous.
Hence, even when poisoning
the life of a maiden,
there was no
feeling of remorse within him.
What are you saying, brother?
Have you heard about
the King of Kashi
and the woeful tale of his
daughter Amba, beloved sister?
I have heard
that the elder sister
of your mothers, Amba
has been born again
to slay the great Bhishma.
Impossible!
It is impossible to slay uncle!
He has the boon
of dying at will.
And a person who cannot die
cannot be defeated.
These are mere rumours!
He has spread these rumours
only to scare people.
But you need not be afraid of
grandfather any longer, father.
The strength of
the 100 sons of yours
is enough to defeat anyone.
We are certain, son,
that by proving your might
you will make
your parents proud.
But do remember, son
that more than your victory
your life is
more precious to me.
Have faith, father.
Drupad does not have the might
to defeat your son.
I shall certainly make him bow
before our teacher.
Why do you not behead him and
place it at your teacher's feet?
Dronacharya will be
held guilty for this
while you shall earn
all the virtues.
Chopping the thorns off a tree
is a wise thing to do,
Duryodhan.
Goodbye.
- May you be victorious!
May you be victorious!
Durochan
anyone more skilled than you in
constructing a grand house
won't be found in Hastinapur.
That's why I have summoned
you for this work.
The palace for Kunti
and Pandavas
should stand shorter than
other palaces, Durochan!
But make sure that from
Duryodhan's sleeping chambers
the Pandavas' flag
shouldn't be visible.
Don't worry, Your Highness.
I'll not give anyone a reason
to be unsatisfied.
Disperse!
Duryodhan...
Son
why do you seem so dull?
- I'm not dull
but I'm very furious, father!
Come close to me, son.
What's the problem, dear?
- Problem?
The problem is that
I hail from royalty.
The problem is that my father
is an emperor.
Had I been born in a normal
business family or at sculptor's
or a cowherd's family
I wouldn't have faced
this problem.
What are you saying, son?
Every son is a successor
to his father.
To acquire the livestock
a cowherd's son doesn't have to
wait for coronation.
If the businessman's son
is not competent enough
then his family faces a problem.
But if the king's son
is not competent enough
then the entire kingdom faces
problems, Duryodhan.
Well said.
Well said.
Even I was trying to explain
the same to Duryodhan
dear Gandhari.
Duryodhan
you've accepted
that you are the successor
to your father
but it's
a disbelief.
Your father is helpless.
Till His Excellency Bhishma
is the de facto authority
His Highness can't take any
decision on his own. - Shakuni!
Forgive me, Your Highness
if I have said
something wrong.
I was just
trying to explain him
that he'll have to prove
his potential
or else
Bhim and Yudhishthir
becoming recluses
can only be prayed for.
Keep quiet, Shakuni!
I've heard enough.
As an emperor
of Hastinapur
only you will be enthroned, son.
It's a promise
by your father.
The coronation ceremony will be
conducted for you shortly.
Shortly.
I'll discuss with grandsire
about this matter.
- But lord...
Buts
are obsolete, Gandhari.
Before speaking
anything contrary
answer my question
and if not me, answer it
to yourself.
Don't you want your son
to be enthroned as
a king of Hastinapur?
Certainly
but I want my son
to be a competent king
who values righteousness.
A golden crown is bejeweled only
after it's moulded, Gandhari
and not before that.
When my son will become a king
he'll prove his competency.
Today I'll order Vidur for
arranging the coronation.
Duryodhan
we'll have
to plan out something
so that the sons of Pandu
leave Hastinapur
and go away forever.
Create such a situation
for them
that Kunti is compelled
to take them
to Kuntibhoj.
I hope
you're getting my point.
But why, uncle?
Father will anyway get
me coronated.
My dear.
You foolish darling!
It's Kuru empire.
Your grandsire Bhishma
will stop you
from being coronated.
But why?
- Because his love for Pandavas
is above all.
He sides with them.
Just for this reason.
If they protest against me
even then
grandsire will favour them.
But those five wouldn't protest
at all, dear Duryodhan.
All the five of them
follow the path
of righteousness
and those who tread that path
can be
meted out injustice
in copious amounts.
Those following the path
of inequity
aren't affected
by righteousness, grandsire.
And Duryodhan
has started on
the path of iniquity.
I have a fear, grandsire
that the future of Kuru lineage
is going to be really dreadful.
There's nothing to be so upset
about, Vidur.
A gardener fastens
a creeper to a pole
and the creeper slowly
learns to climb on the pole.
If a child is given a lesson
on what is just and unjust
then even he can, soon
change his disposition
and mentality.
These 105 kids fostering
love
trust
and respect for each other
is mandatory.
How will we teach them to love
each other, grandsire?
Vidur
persons living together develop
love for each other
just like when the water
and seed come close
a sapling is but inevitable.
Just the ways
of living together
and spending a life
has to be taught.
That has to be taught
with determination.
Hey!
Brother, for whom is this
grand dinner organised?
It's nothing like that, Bhim.
It's a daily routine
in the palace.
For all the attendants, guards,
the ministry
and the royal family,
such food is prepared daily.
Do you remember,
father used to say
the kingdom in which
the attendants are hungry
stays troubled itself.
So that implies I can
eat to my fill daily!
You, anyhow, look for an option
to satisfy your hunger, brother.
We all now could
eat to my fill...
Say like that.
Don't I let you all have food?
Nakul, don't make me angry.
Go and count
the varieties of dishes.
Stop!
Stop!
What are you doing?
How can you eat
without permission?
Permission? Whose?
Yours?
Behold. These wild men aren't
even aware of royal etiquettes.
This is what happens
when you stay in the forest
with animals for too long.
But they are our brothers.
So are the orders of grandsire.
So we must teach them better.
Look who's seated there.
Who is he?
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?
Go. Seek his permission.
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?
Massage the minister's feet.
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?
Seems like the elder brother
must massage minister's feet.
Come forth, elder brother.
Elder brother.
Let it be.
I do not wish to eat.
You need to eat sometime.
Without the minister's consent
you may never be allowed to eat.
Come forth, elder brother.
Elder brother,
I don't want to eat!
Dear brother Duryodhan.
Kindly allow Bhim
to have a 'laddoo'.
So much malice isn't good.
Let no one be served
prior to meal time.
These are the orders
of the food minister.
Sugdha.
Why is this room
so well decorated?
Queen Gandhari had ordered
that your room be
as well decorated as hers.
I am not a queen.
I'm the wife of a hermit.
I and my sons
sleep on a makeshift
straw mat on the floor.
But the members of
the royal family
must get accustomed to
decorative and ornate things.
Dushala.
Come here.
I was so eager to see you.
Greetings.
Greetings. - Stepmother Kunti,
where are your sons?
Mother had asked me
to greet them too.
They have gone
to have their meals.
My sons are your brothers.
You have
a 105 brothers.
105 brothers?
Aren't you happy to have
so many brothers?
But
brother Duryodhan
wasn't pleased.
But why?
He was saying
that your sons are here
to become the crown princes.
But brother Duryodhan wishes
to be the crown prince.
And he says that your sons
are his foes.
Princes, henceforth, as per
His Excellency Bhishma's orders
there shall be changes in
the seating arrangements.
Prince Duryodhan,
Prince Dushashan
Prince Dussahan,
Prince Dushalan
Prince Jalgranthar
and Prince Shaman.
The six of you,
for the five Pandavas
will have to share seats.
Prince Duryodhan, seats be
arranged for the sons of Pandu.
Right now.
Prince Duryodhan.
Let the meals be served
to the princes.
One more.
One more.
Two more.
Glutton.
Today there is
a simple rule to the meal.
No one will bend
their elbow
while having their meals today.
You may now commence
with the meals.
Mahadev, help us.
Parashuram's celestial axe and
Bheesma's 'Brahmastra
if the weapons
collide then it will be
catastrophic for
the entire universe, my Lord.
Mahadev.
Stop, Parashuram.
Bheeshma has passed your test.
If the two of you
keep fighting each other
the entire universe
will be annihilated.
But I have not yet
got justice, Mahadev.
Then how can you
stop this battle?
Lord Parashuram is bound
by his promise, Mahadev.
Until my mind is not at rest
Lord Parashuram
must continue this battle.
My Lord,
fulfill this wish of mine.
I wish to see him dead, Mahadev.
I wish to be
the cause of his death.
As it is a plea to
Lord Parashuram
I must fulfill your wish.
But I cannot foster
the negative feeling
of vengeance.
Aiming at a higher goal
or noble deed
when you wish
the death of Bheeshma
you will surely become
the cause of his death.
Then I do not wish to live.
But I shall be reborn
to have my vengeance.
Expunge your heart of this
bitterness, Princess Amba.
I promise you...
When the day ordained
by Lord Shiva arrives
I shall lay down my weapons
when I confront you.
I do not require
your generosity, Bheeshma.
I shall not forgive you.
Even after 25 years
I shall be born with the resolve
to kill you.
The throne of Hastinapur for
which you have ruined my life
you will strive day and night
for that very throne.
The throne will never allow you
to sleep peacefully at night.
You will run
and the throne will
make you run your whole life
and when your soul
will be aged and fatigued
I shall come then
as your doom.
Panchal
Town of Kampawa.
25 Years Later.
Shakti is finally born
in the kingdom of Panchal.
Royal Astrologer,
I am quite certain
that Drupada's queen must have
given birth to a daughter.
I have been awaiting
the birth of this girl
for the past 25 years.
Ever since I have known
that a woman will be the cause
Bheeshma's death.
I have been praying to the Lord
for that girl to be born
in our family.
A daughter is born, father.
All hail Goddess Mahakali!
My wish has been fulfilled,
Drupada.
Bheeshma had insulted me
and our entire kingdom.
Do not make the mistake
of instigating me
otherwise the whole of Panchal
will burn the way Lanka did!
This girl will avenge the insult.
There is nothing more beautiful
than revenge
in this entire world.
The birth of this girl child
has brought all the beauty
of the world to me.
And that is why,
this girl shall be
called Shikhandini
Royal Astrologer
what do the stars say
about my granddaughter?
It was 12:07 PM today
when this girl child was born.
Rahu has a great influence
on her fate.
This girl will surely be
successful in carrying out
all the duties of her life.
But only after a great struggle
Struggle is the best teacher.
I will poison
this girl against Bheeshma!
I firmly believe
that this girl will be the
cause of Bheeshma's death.
To ruminate over
the death of Bheeshma
will be the sole purpose
of Shikhandini.
The wishes and ambitions
of ancestors
and also their anger,
enmity and revenge
become the legacy
of the future generations.
Parents try their best
to give their children
all the happiness of the world
but end up giving them
their agony as wealth.
They intend to give them love
but end up filling them
with hate.
Think about it.
What have you
taught your children?
You must have given them
love, knowledge and wealth
but did you not fill their
hearts with hate as well.
Did you not impart to them
the preconceived notions of
good and bad?
Does the struggle of one man
with another
that of one society with another
and that of a nation
with another
not get decided by these
preconceived notions?
Do murder, death and bloodshed
not arise from these
preconceived notions?
In other words
parents give their children
life as well as death.
They give them the light of love
as well as the darkness of hate
and darkness may reside
in the mind of one
or may even be a real one
but the only result of it
is fear.
Only fear.
Think about it.
Hastinapur.
Sindh.
Adra.
Gandhar.
Kshubbha!
Kshubbha!
Princess Gandhari,
I am right here.
Aghuna, Kaarya,
quit staring at me
and go and bring
an earthen lamp.
Princess, please calm down.
All the lamps will be lit soon.
The breeze extinguished them.
Please calm down.
Aghuna, the two of you
were ordered
to be in this chamber with lamps
in your hands the whole night!
Then how could the lamps
get extinguished?
Do you not know how scared
Princess Gandhari
is of the dark?
Why am I so afraid of the dark?
Not just you, Princess Gandhari
everyone is afraid of the dark
because our eyes are
our windows to the world.
If one has vision,
one has everything.
But one feels completely
lost in the dark.
The whole world vanishes.
That is why we are
afraid of the dark.
But now, you need not fear it.
You should go back to sleep now.
Such a big army!
I must inform King Subal
about this right away.
A huge army
great strength
and a kingdom which is
wealthier than Lord Kuber
is where my daughter
will be married, sir.
And her husband
will be so good looking
that he will give tough
competition to even Gods.
He will be stronger than
the God of wind
and will have more qualities
than Lord Indra himself.
Any disability
or the slightest flaw
then my Gandhari will not
be married to such a man.
Our daughter is remarkable, sir.
After all, Lord Shiva has given
her the boon to have 100 sons.
Princess Gandhari.
What is the matter, sir?
While reading Gandhari's horoscope
why have you become so grave?
Pardon me, your Majesty.
The stars in her...
- Your Highness
General Shatashwa requests
permission to meet the king.
As this hour?
But the king
is occupied right now.
Your Highness,
pardon my intrusion
but the news is such
that I must converse
with the king right away.
What news do you have,
Shatashwa?
Whom does the army belong to?
We have sent our messengers
to find out, my lord.
The soldier
who delivered this news
had not seen
the flag of the army.
How much time will it
take them to reach here?
About six to nine hours,
your Majesty.
Where is Prince Shakuni?
- He is on a journey
for some special purpose.
Someone has dared to attack
the kingdom of Gandhar!
And to attack without
prior notice
is against the Indian rules
of warfare, your Majesty.
Then I shall punish them
for disregarding the rules
of our nation, Lohit!
I will annihilate that army!
This is Gandhar!
Each soldier here has the
strength of a hundred elephants.
Each one of them is like
a brave lion.
But your Majesty,
we have a very small army.
It's courage that brings victory
not weapons, Lohit.
My soldiers will tear apart
the armour of the enemies
and rip their hearts out!
Shatashwa.
- Yes, your Majesty.
Prepare the army.
Tell all the soldiers
to bid goodbye to their families.
Order every citizen
to pick up a weapon.
This will be a terrible battle!
Lord Indra is your
biological father.
Will you be able to fight him?
The 'Vedas' say
that the might of Lord Indra
can be matched by only one God.
Agni Dev.
Agni Dev is termed as the
face of the Gods.
Today, I shall pray to Agni Dev
to have the love of my father.
And if I am unable
to have his love
then I would rather die!
But such an enormous forest
cannot be destroyed.
To chop down a tree
is far more grave a sin
than killing 100 humans.
Do not worry,
Panchali.
I shall pray to Agni Dev*
*God of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices.
to prey on only the illusions
of Mayasur.
I will ask him not to
harm the trees.
The illusion of Mayasur
is very powerful, Arjun.
Can it be destroyed?
Brother Bheem
Agni Dev is also called
the devourer.
Agni Dev can devour anything.
Even the illusion of Mayasur
will be devoured by him.
But ensure that he does not
devour the serpents, Arjun.
In order to save the humans
if we kill the serpents
then it would be unrighteous.
Lord of the Serpents,
there is still time.
Go and seek the refuge
of the Pandavas.
Mayasur, if you
had not transformed this forest
into an illusory one
and helped me
then I
would have bitten you
this instant.
And the one I bite
can not
be helped by anyone.
Son of Pandu,
Arjun.
Do not cross your limits.
I protect this forest.
Lord Indra
you protect
the entire world!
Yet, according to their needs,
competent warriors
make use of the earth.
Then why can we not,
Lord Indra?
Because I protect the serpents
of this forest!
These serpents have
committed the crime
of biting innocent people!
And protecting the culprits
does not befit the Gods,
Lord Indra!
Arjun!
Do not preach me
about righteousness.
When compared to me
you are only a child.
I am your child,
Lord Indra.
And the child sitting
on his father's shoulders
has a better vision
than his father!
Arjun!
Go away from here
otherwise you shall
meet your doom!
My life is a gift from you,
Lord Indra.
I would be blessed
if you gift me death as well!
But by laying down my weapons
I cannot tarnish
your reputation.
Arjun!
My foolish subjects!
Stop! Consuming
rodents as a meal
has left all of you
with a similar disposition!
Stop!
Who are you scared of?
No one can defeat us!
Stop!
Lord Indra
use your 'vajra!'*
*A club with a ribbed spherical head, symbolize both the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force).
You must keep
the promise you made!
Where are you going,
Mayasur?!
After spending
many joyful years in my refuge
you are abandoning me now?!
Dakshak
I had made a deal with you.
It was an exchange of benefits.
But this is a mortal trouble.
Neither can you protect me
nor can I protect you.
I am now going to seek
the refuge of the Pandavas.
Arjuna!
- Brother!
Lord Indra!
I am your son
and an ardent follower
of Lord Kartikeya*
*The god of war, the commander-in-chief of the army of the devas (gods) and the son of Shiva and Parvati.
who is the husband
of your daughter Devsena!
I will not get defeated
so easily.
I will not be defeated,
Lord Indra.
Lord Indra...
It's not a contest to test yours
and Arjuna's potential.
Arjuna is merely asking you
to spare our subjects' lives.
He is not trying to insult you.
Please do not show the Vajra
but clemency, My Lord.
O divine weapon Vajra!
Please accept my greetings.
Please show respect
to my divine weapon
and calm down.
There are five steps here,
brother
and the wedding rituals
will be conducted over there.
I can feel the presence
of a lot of people, Pandu.
People from the entire Kuru
empire have come here, brother.
After all, it is the wedding
of their future king.
Many sacrificial altar
have been made here.
The entire place has been
adorned with flowers.
I sensed that, Pandu.
I can smell the tuberoses,
garlands of magnolias.
You are unparalleled, brother!
Sometimes, l close my eyes
and try to identify
the objects around me
but it is futile.
Pandu
the way a blind person cannot
see again with his eyes opened.
Similarly, one cannot close
one's eyes
and become blind.
Flowers have been scattered
from here to the entrance.
The Princess of Gandhar will
come from there for the wedding.
How much longer till the
wedding ceremony, Pandu?
Pandu?
Pandu. - The Kuru Prince
seems impatient to get married.
Do not be so restless, prince.
When the bride
enters this place
you shall definitely hear
the sound of her anklets.
Pardon me, brother.
I had to go receive the aged
and blind Yadav.
I do not need your help.
I can hear pretty well.
I shall hear Gandhari's anklets
when she arrives here.
Before you hear her anklets,
you shall hear the accolades.
But I think, you will hear
only her anklets.
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Pandu
I can hear her anklets.
You were right, Pandu.
I can only hear her anklets.
But..
But why did the other sounds
die out, Pandu?
Pandu
what is happening here?
Why isn't anyone
saying anything?
Stop!
What kind of a joke is this?
Why have you tied a cloth
over your eyes?
Pandu
what is Queen Mother saying?
It is true, brother.
The Princess of Gandhar has
covered her eyes with a cloth.
Pardon my daughter, Queen Mother
but she has taken an oath
of keeping her eyes covered
for the rest of her life.
She will keep her eyes covered
for the rest of her life!
King of Gandhar,
what is the meaning of all this?
She has taken an oath,
Queen Mother.
We tried our best
to dissuade her
but she refuses
to break her oath.
How dare you mock the
descendants of the Kuru dynasty!
We approached you
with a marriage proposal
and in return,
you are insulting us?
We do not intend to mock
or insult you, Queen Mother.
Then what is all this?
Betrayal?
When Bheeshma had come to
Gandhar with the proposal
you never said
that your daughter had decided
to take such an oath.
If the girl cannot become
Dhritarashtra's vision
then she is of no use to us.
Pardon my daughter, Queen Mother
but.. - A woman who mocks
my blindness
can never become my wife!
I reject this woman!
I have left my father's home
behind, my lord
to become your better half.
If you reject me
then I will have to enter
the holy fire.
My child
if you are here to get married
then what is the reason
behind the blindfold?
You should know
that the Kuru prince
needs a wife
who can become his vision.
A true wife is one
who completes her husband.
Accept my greetings,
grandfather.
I do not consider my lord
to be incomplete.
That is why, the question of
completing him does not arise.
To me, my lord is not incomplete
but just a little different
from the rest.
And in order to become
his true mate
I must accept
this different lifestyle.
To me, my lord is not incomplete
but just a little different
from the rest.
And in order to become
his true mate
I must accept
this different lifestyle.
My culture
teaches me, grandfather
that I have no right to see
and be blessed with vision
when my husband cannot..
- The task of
familiarizing your husband
with the scenes of the world
is yours, Gandhari.
Greetings, Queen Mother.
Even a servant
can accomplish this task
but the feelings
of a blind person
can be understood
only by another.
And how can a marital life be
complete if a husband and wife
cannot understand each other's
joy and sorrow.
We only see a serpent
crawl on the ground
but how it is able
to morph its form
is something that we
cannot understand.
Because in the process
of understanding another being
our experiences form
the major obstacle.
I know what it feels like
to be able to see
and as long as my vision
continues to dictate my life
I will not be able to feel
the emotions of my lord.
That is why I have decided
to sacrifice my vision
forever.
Before taking such an oath
you should have given this
more thought, my child.
But thoughts give birth
only to a decision.
An oath is born from the pure
feelings of one's heart.
Thoughts can be
clouded by deceit
but never an oath.
Pardon my impudence, grandfather
but who else can know
more about oaths than you?
Give me your blessings
to help me soak the pain
of my husband's heart
into my own.
Give me the blessing that
whenever my husband is hurt
I feel the pain instead of him.
I pray to you to accept me
as your daughter-in-law
and to bless me
with the opportunity
to bless the Kuru dynasty
with 100 illustrious sons.
And give me the opportunity
to accept the darkness
of my husband's life
and bestow him with the
fruits of my penance.
After hearing all this
what is your decision now,
grandfather?
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari..
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Long live Princess Gandhari!
Kripacharya.
This is a very grim situation,
Queen Mother.
This act of Princess Gandhari
is neither in accordance
with our holy scriptures
nor is it traditional.
Even Prince Dhritarashtra
dislikes this act.
Fear will loom in this marriage
because when a husband and wife
do not live in harmony
the offspring does not
turn out well.
To have a good progeny
it is necessary for the couple
to have love for each other.
But even Princess Gandhari
has taken a terrible oath,
my lord!
It is believed by wise sages
that an oath always
goes against traditions
because no oath is required
for what is traditional.
But it is also true that an oath
opens up new horizons
which eventually take
the form of a tradition.
That is why honouring
an oath is desirable.
What Princess Gandhari said
in her favour
reflects her dedication,
great Bheeshma.
In my opinion
Prince Dhritarashtra should
accept Princess Gandhari
wholeheartedly.
And give her the true love
she deserves.
It would be appropriate.
This is in favour of Hastinapur
and the Kuru dynasty.
The marriage is now complete.
Sukta..
This apparel
is improper, Sukta.
Not proper, you say.
This apparel is gorgeous.
It has been adorned with
red rubies, yellow topaz
and sapphires.
In the light of these lamps,
these look like
innumerable suns
in the evening sky.
They look like?
To whom, Sukta?
To my lord,
all these are worthless.
Princess..
And from today, for me as well.
Bring some flowers
for my adornment, Sukta.
Fragrant
and intoxicating.
Attach small bells
to my apparels
that seem like music to my lord.
What good is all this adornment
if it reminds my lord
of his blindness?
Every moment in life
is a moment of decision.
At every step, one has to
decide about the next step.
And the decision..
The decision leaves
a lasting impression.
Decisions taken in the present
bring about happiness
or sadness in the future,
not just for oneself
but for one's family
and the future generations too.
When one is faced with a dilemma
the heart becomes distraught
and is filled with indecision.
The moment of decision
becomes a battle
and the heart becomes
a battlefield.
We take most decisions not to
find a solution to a problem
but to calm one's heart.
But can one eat while running?
No.
Then, can a heart
in a state of battle
take the correct decision?
In reality
when one takes a decision
with a calm mind
he ensures a happy
future for himself.
But
when one takes a decision
to calm his heart
it will invariably cause him
pain and misery in the future.
Think about it.
Arjun, my son.
This is a request from your grandfather.
Go and invite my liberation.
Bring Shikhandini
to the battlefield
at the earliest.
King of Yakshas.
[WIND BLOWING]
Why do you keep rendering
my meditation futile?!
You had promised me
that when the time is right
you would help me
complete my meditation.
Each time you tried
to render my meditation futile
I resorted to even more
austere meditation.
You will have to help me.
Answer me King of Yakshas!
Answer me!
I was born again only to slay
His Excellency Bhishma.
And if I am unable to have
my revenge even in this life
then this life is worthless to me!
I shall destroy this body
and be born again!
Either help me make
this life of mine worthwhile
or commit sin of being
responsible for my death!
Mahadev
even this life that you gave me
was futile.
Allow me to die.
Grandsire will die
only when he gives up
his weapons, uncle
and he will do so
only before Shikhandini.
And because she is a woman
uncle had lady Shikhandini
barred from entering the battlefield.
But she has received a boon
from mahadev, Prince Dusshasan
and a boon granted by a God
can never be fruitless.
All of you need to stay cautious.
Friend Karna
as long as Lady Amba's soul
resides in the body of a woman
she will not become
the reason of grandsire's death
in this war.
Grandsire is invincible.
Defeating Grandsire is impossible.
Do you not say,
Govind
that fate does not require
an invitation?
Sister too will have to complete
her meditation
and enter the battlefield.
But we cannot create our next
strategy based on this belief Draupadi.
His excellency took a decision
today
that he will not slay anyone.
However, the army of the Kauravas
will indeed have his protection.
This war will continue
for eternity.
Even then neither will we attain success
nor the sons of Dhritarashtra.
And our army is getting depleted.
Now we have only two...
only two akshauhini army.
Very soon our army will be annihilated
and it is a rule of a war
that if an army gets destroyed
or when all the soldiers flee
the king of that army
must accept defeat.
In other words
as long as Grandsire alive
our victory is impossible.
If Grandsire remains alive for too long
then our defeat is inevitable.
If lady Shikhandini is unsuccessful
in her meditation
then this war of ours
will also be unsuccessful.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
You seem to be forgetting brother Sahadev
the Mahadev Himself
had promised Lady Amba
that when she
aims at a noble deed
she will indeed become the cause
of His excellency's defeat.
Moreover, Mahadev's promise
can never be false.
That is why,
I had advised Shikhandini
to go to the King of Yakshas.
What do you mean Vasudev?
It means, Your Highness,
that I am here.
Lady Shikhandini
I am here because the promise I made you
Till yesterday, the society
knew you as a woman
but now, no one will
accept you as a man either
Like a swan and a peacock
are equally beautiful
but neither does one of them
a swan a peacock.
Nor a peacock a swan.
You will have to bear numerous
blemishes and appellations.
I am prepared
King of the Yakshas.
Years ago when you
stopped me from killing myself
you had made me a promise
that you would make me
a man for a day.
Today you must fulfill your promise
King of the Yakshas.
That is why, I performed
such an austere meditation.
Now, you must fulfill your promise.
I respect your oath.
For a day
I shall assume your womanhood
and give you my manhood.
The moment you leave this pyre
you shall be a man.
Your name shall be Shikhandi
and with my blessings
no one will suspect you.
But do remember
you will transform into a man
this evening
but you shall stay a man only
till sundown tomorrow.
You have only one day
with you to discharge your duty.
Only one day.
Before sundown tomorrow,
Bhishma will die at my hands Draupadi
and after that, I must renounce
this society forever.
However you must not
mourn my absence.
Vasudev has said
that numerous sacrifice will be made
in this war of righteousness.
Do not fret about my sacrifice.
After this war. I shall finally have my revenge
and the entire world will have justice
and righteousness!
My darling!
My darling that wicked Yadava
Vasudev Krishna
has deceived us.
He has weaved such web
of treachery
that we have been defeated with just one blow.
What happened uncle?
My darling
our spies have brought the news
that Shikhandini,
the daughter of Drupad
has exchanged her gender
with the King of the Yakshas
for a day and has come here
as a man.
In other words
tomorrow in the war
the son of Drupad
Shikhandi will be present
and when confronted against him
His excellency Bhishma
will give up his weapons.
However
it is quite fortunate
that this transformation lasts only for a day.
If his excellency Bhishma is not present
in the battlefield tomorrow
then he cannot be slain.
My darling go at once and command
his excellency Bhishma
and persuade him to leave
the battlefield tomorrow.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Grandsire
Shikhandini,
the daughter of King Drupad
has returned as a man to slay you.
So Lady Amba is here.
Lord Shiva himself has
illuminated the path to realize
the promise He made.
This time. Lady Amba must indeed
have aimed at a higher goal
or an even nobler deed.
That is impossible Grandsire.
Then you need to leave this battlefield.
You cannot battle until sundown tomorrow.
Crown prince Duryodhan
you have reminded me of my duties
and now, you are advising me
to resort to unrighteousness!
I cannot leave the battlefield.
Obeying my orders is your duty
Grandsire.
Hence, I command you
to leave this battlefield.
Bless you dear but I cannot obey your order.
Vasudev Krishna enlightened me
that a man who is tied to his duties
cannot be bound by
the orders of someone else.
I have been awaiting Lady Amba
for years.
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow, before the sundown,
I shall give up my weapons
forever.
Food in the hands of some people
seems like a curse
while even a weapon
in the hands of others
seems like a boon.
The right hand of the Almighty
always raised to grant one a boon
similarly grandsire's entire life
is filled with boons.
While attacking him.
It will feel as though
we are desecrating an idol 
of the Almighty.
Merely imagining grandsire's death
is driving a stake though our hearts.
Grandsire's presence would always give us
a feeling of great trust
and deep peace, Panchali.
From tomorrow,
the peace in our lives
will be lost forever.
But we have deemed this bloodshed
our duty, sons of Pandu.
The day this war had begun
It was decided then
that we must also slay
His excellency Bhishma.
For nine days straight
we have been trying to defeat
his excellency
and now when it is time to achieve
our objective
and my sister Shikhandini
made such grave sacrifice
for your victory
what is the meaning
of being so emotional?
Brother,
my lords are not at fault here.
The decision to wage a war
and to take an oath are of the mind
but the heart...
The heart knows neither
an argument nor any duty.
It shudders at the very thought
of death of a beloved person.
Govind
you need to show us
a way out now.
This is the peculiarity
of human nature, friend.
The way the moment a swing
reaches one end
it gets pulled toward
the opposite direction
and begins to move towards it similarly
an intelligent human being
begins to have contrary thoughts
the moment a task gets completed.
This very quality
is both his weakness
and his strength.
This is the very quality
that keeps a man away
from sins and atrocities.
However this very quality
also keeps him
from achieving success.
But what is the solution
to this dilemma, Vasudev?
The solution to this
can be offered only by
his excellency.
To emerge victorious in this war,
we must devise a stratagem to take down
His Majesty Bhisma.
On the day of the war.
Madhav!
Your chariot's here, Parth.
Along with the charioteer.
No, Madhav.
You can't become my charioteer.
Do you not believe me, Parth?
I am very proficient with this.
No, Madhav.
You are a respected person.
I can't let you become a charioteer.
It doesn't matter, Parth.
If you feel like it
then consider me
just sitting in front of you.
As the horses are in my care
I'll never let your mind waver, Parth.
In honesty and deception...
Between truth and immorality...
Every time your mind
loses focus
it would be my duty
to bring you to the 
right course again.
Both in custody of your chariot
or your life,
I am proficient in both, Parth.
All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
Karna.
I will wait for you
on the battlefield.
Until you draw your bowstring
we will not achieve victory.
I also wait for that day, 
friend.
I may be physically here
but my soul
will accompany you in the battlefield.
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!
May God bless you
with victory, sons.
May your war skills
will make you immortal.
I bless you all.
Do not worry about me, mother.
Sire!
I assure you that this day
I'll be back with victory
from the battlefield.
Dear...
I hope you win.
Your victory in this war is decided.
Accept my last greeting, mother.
No one realizes
that at the end of this war
who will greet the god of death,
and who will go through life
with memories of the war.
People of Kuru along with the Arya clan
including women, children,
pottery, blacksmith,
and farmers.
All will survive, my son.
to have pleasures in life.
Your enemy is also
enemy to society.
Have no mercy on them.
Fill the vessel of god Bhairav* with blood, my child.
*Bhairava or Kala Bhairava is the fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.
Fill the vessel of god Bhairav 
with blood, my child.
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!
Order the attack,
brother Yudhishtir.
Charioteer,
take the chariot to the front.
Yudhishtir.
Are you already scared?
Repent for your actions and 
accept your punishment,
Dusshasan,
time to ask forgiveness 
has long gone.
But if you want to save
your soldiers' life
then surrender yourself
and accept the death penalty,
brother Yudhishtir.
At least your righteousness will 
live longer than you.
Grandsire Bhishma!
Do not forget
that you had taken oath
for the throne of Hastinapur.
Uncle speaks right, grandsire.
Do not bless me.
But before this war begins
I will not give up my ethic.
Therefore, by greeting you
and our teacher...
me and my brothers
here to ask for your permissions
for war,
Grandsire,
like birds build their nests
on branches in the shade of trees
and live happily
we've been living in a safe place 
because of you.
Every part of us is indebted 
to you.
Today...
we have been forced to take up 
arms against you.
Like aquatic animals trying to 
drink up dry the entire ocean.
Grandsire,
give us permission to war,
or order us to surrender
our weapons.
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
You better not leave, cowherd.
My last sacrifice
will be you.
Have faith in me,
Emperor.
I have not come here
to run away this time.
Emperor, do you engage only
in verbal grappling-combat
or do you use
your limbs as well?
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
Why is this fool
not making the sacrifices
but engaging in a
grappling-combat instead?
Who is Jarasandha
fighting with?
He seems
quite familiar.
And those two
Brahmins' as well.
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
That is Vasudev Krishna,
my darling.
I must stop Jarasandha.
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
So
is this the might
of the son of Pandu?
Had I known this before,
I would have sent my grandson
to engage in a
grappling-combat with you.
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!
All hail Vasudev Krishna!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Bheem!
All hail Vasudev Krishna!
All hail Prince Arjun!
All hail Prince Bheem!
Bless you.
Brother Yudhishthir,
the ogre Jara
had joined the two halves
of a body to create Jarasandha
but I have divided
that body into two again.
The earth has been relieved
of another burden, brother.
Jarasandha didn't stand a chance
against your might, Bheem.
Not only my might
but also my intelligence
is praiseworthy, brother.
Vasudev was playing
with twigs over there.
Upon seeing him,
it struck me
that if I throw
the halves of Jarasandha
in opposite directions
then he will not be able
to become whole again.
I know that it is a lie
but don't you dare try to
oppose my point, Vasudev.
No, brother Bheem.
How can a person
who slayed Jarasandha
ever be opposed by me?
You truly are intelligent!
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir.
Bless you, Arjun.
The first obstacle
that stood in the way
of carrying out mother's order
has been removed
by the three of you.
To add to your joy
let me give you
a piece of news, My Lord.
Very soon, Subhadra will
give birth to your child.
Bless you.
Subhadra
just like his father,
your son will
also be a great warrior.
His fame will be immortalized
till the end of time.
When brother Yudhishthir
becomes King
his heir will be growing
inside Subhadra's womb.
It is not yet the time to be
thinking of an heir, brother.
It is time to take the second
step towards your independence.
The next step now is the Rajsuya
Yajna,' brother Yudhishthir.
Yes, Nakul.
I will go to Hastinapur soon
and seek grandsire's permission
for the Rajsuya 'Yajna.
Pardon me,
brother Yudhishthir
but
independence can never be had
through someone's permission.
It is procured through
one's resolution.
The entire Aryan region
is afflicted
with unrighteousness.
The basis of a kingdom
is the happiness of the subjects
and not the prosperity
of the King
but majority of the Kings
are forgetting this key fact.
The task of making them
adhere to righteousness
can be done only by you,
King Yudhishthir.
We must conduct
the Rajsuya 'Yajna' soon.
We must make those Kings
adhere to righteousness
and the ones who refuse
to adhere to it
must be annihilated
otherwise there will
come a time, Your Highness
when, despite wanting
to adhere to righteousness
one will be unable to do so.
Everyone will
take to the path
of unrighteousness.
Vrushali.
It was a question of the
Crown Prince's future, Vrushali.
Had I not accepted
this position again
forming an alliance
with Emperor Jarasandha
would have been impossible
and a crucial plan
would also have fallen through.
That is why, the Crown Prince
requested... - A plan?
Was the plan successful,
Radheya?
No, Vrushali.
Situations have changed now
but the moment I had decided
to become King again
I had only one duty to carry out
which was,
in order to help my friend
to be prepared to make
any sacrifice asked of me.
Is there any circumstance
that never changes?
During the darkness
of a solar eclipse
birds return to their nests
not because it is night
but because
they deem the day to be so
but night-time
follows eventually.
Bearing a crown on the head
does not bring about a change
in one's heart, Vrushali.
I am still the same.
This crown is my duty, Vrushali.
That is why, I am compelled
to bear its burden.
But I assure you,
Vrushali
that I will
never commit an incorrect deed.
Is your
will power your own, Radheya?
If you had that independence
then why would you have to
bear that crown again?
This is 'Lakshagraha.
A 'yajna' will be
conducted there. A 'yajna!
And in that 'yajna
that palace will be used
as the sacrifice, friend.
And my enemies
will burn to ashes
in that 'yajna!
Not only your enemies,
Prince Duryodhan
but also the competence
of this friend of yours
your respect,
the glory of your ancestors
and even the righteousness
of Hastinapur
will burn to ashes.
What are you saying, friend?
Why are you unhappy
on this joyous occasion?
Pardon me, Prince Duryodhan
but it will be a truly
joyous occasion for me
when my arrows will crush
the head of my enemy
and my enemy's arrows will
cut right through my chest.
Beheading an enemy
who is sleeping
is like chopping down the tree
of righteousness, friend.
This is the difference between
a murderer and a hero.
Righteousness?
Righteousness!
Do not ramble on about
righteousness, King of Anga.
There is only one form of
righteousness in the world...
Victory!
Because only victors
create history.
And the traditions
mentioned in history
assume the form of righteousness
down the road.
Lie!
Righteousness is something
that nurtures the possibilities
and capabilities of a person.
Any task that weakens
the soul of man
cannot be righteousness, friend.
In other words, do you have
a soft corner for the Pandavas
now, King of Anga?
King of Anga, did you forget
who made you King?
Foolish Dusshasan!
Be quiet!
My friend
is correct.
If any task of mine
is hurting my friend
then I shall not perform it.
Have Purochan
informed right away!
The plan has been cancelled!
Brother Duryodhan...
- No more arguments!
The plan has been cancelled.
Friend Karna
your happiness is more
valuable to me.
If you do not want me
to become the Crown Prince
and the King in the future
then I shall
renounce my royal life.
I desire to make you a glorious
emperor, Prince Duryodhan.
I am against deception.
I am not against a battle.
Battle? With whom shall
I engage in a battle?
With my father?
With my grandsire?
With my uncle Vidur?
Even if I win in that situation
it will be deemed
my defeat, friend.
In the battle,
will I behead my father
or will he behead me, friend?
Just answer this question
of mine, friend.
They have deceived us.
They are the unrighteous ones,
friend Karna.
They have given rise
to such a situation, friend
where I will have to either
resort to unrighteousness
OT
Give up my right.
Friend Karna
the way a person who
snatches the right of another
is sentenced to a life in hell
similarly, falling prey
to weakness
a person who gives up
his right is also
sentenced to a life
in hell, friend.
Pertaining to the topic
of Duryodhan's right
if you have any doubt,
King of Anga
then do speak up now.
No.
I do not doubt it.
Then do show me the way, friend.
Show me the middle path.
Do come back soon, Kunti.
I shall await you.
Certainly, sister-in-law.
Goodbye, brother-in-law.
Bless you.
Goodbye, Her Highness.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, uncle.
- May you live long.
May you live long.
Yudhishthir
one must never impede
the journey of a pilgrim.
That is why,
I am not stopping you.
But the decision of
staying out of Hastinapur
is not a very wise one
at the moment.
All of you
need to be back soon.
Certainly, grandsire.
Staying away from Hastinapur
for too long
will not be easy for us either.
My concern for this place
will keep me wide awake.
Your departure
will rob Hastinapur
of its prosperity, My Lady.
Goodbye, brother.
You need not worry
one bit for Hastinapur.
No, Duryodhan.
I am not worried
about Hastinapur.
The Almighty himself chalks out
the happiness of subjects.
One needs to worry about people
because the Almighty
protects a person only when
he upholds righteousness.
In other words
we are worried about you,
Duryodhan.
Very soon
the reason of your worry
will come to an end,
brother Bheem.
Be happy.
May glory be yours.
King of Anga
may you never deter from
the path of righteousness.
This is the only blessing
I can give you.
Unrighteousness is like mercury
that robs gold of its lustre.
Dwaraka.
In such a short time span
I have acquired so much
from you, Madhav.
The one who has the
mental state to grasp things
only he can acquire
something, friend.
You will come across the
Triveni Confluence on your way.
Do bathe in it.
There
lies the Lost River Saraswati.
While bathing
do think of the tale of
Goddess Saraswati getting lost
in that river.
But I have not
heard of this tale.
It is said that
Goddess Saraswati
could not walk on earth bearing
the holy fire on her palm.
That is why
she began migrating
into the earth.
If you think of this tale
while bathing
you will earn
good fortune, friend.
As you say.
If grandsire continues
battling in this manner
then he will annihilate
our entire army.
Tomorrow, I shall challenge
grandsire to a duel.
And Guru Dronacharya
is fated to die
at the hands of
General Dhrishtadyumna.
Tomorrow,
at any cost
you must retaliate
against Guru Dronacharya.
Retaliating against Guru Drona
by himself is impossible
for General Dhrishtadyumna.
Arjun should help him.
Stopping Guru Drona by oneself
will not be easy for anyone.
If brother Arjun
will battle Guru Drona
then who will retaliate
against grandsire?
Just like a 'vajra
he will annihilate
our entire army.
There is only one way out.
It is mandatory
to keep His Excellency
away from the battlefield.
And if
His Excellency will be
away from the battlefield
and at that very moment
Guru Drona
will be battling Arjun
then Duryodhan
will have no one to protect him.
But Madhav
is it even possible
to keep grandsire
away from the battlefield?
Using treachery.
Yes, friend.
I had said
that treachery will indeed
be employed in this war
and it is time now to employ it.
Treachery?
But resorting to treachery in
a war is unrighteous, Vasudev.
Even this war is a result of
treachery, brother Yudhishthir.
And if the basis of treachery
is righteousness
then employing treachery
is righteous as well.
And in order to boost
the morale of our army
it is mandatory for us
to gain victory tomorrow.
And in order to gain victory
we shall be required to take
only five steps.
Only five steps.
Second Day of the War.
After yesterday's defeat
what strategy have
the sons of Pandu
come up with today,
Sanjay?
Are they trembling with fear
at the very thought of defeat?
Today, the sons of Pandu
have kept Prince Yudhishthir
at the end of their
battle formation, Your Highness.
In order to protect him,
General Dhrishtadyumna
King Virat and the Upapandavas
are present, Your Highness.
The ones leading
the battle formation
are Prince Nakul,
Prince Sahadev
and Prince Abhimanyu,
Your Highness.
On one side of the formation,
there is Prince Arjun
while on the other, there is
Prince Bheem, Your Highness.
But what kind
of a battle formation
have the sons of Pandu
come up with, Sanjay
where Yudhishthir
is right at the end?
Such kind of a formation
is aggressive in nature,
Your Highness.
It can cut right through
the enemy army, Your Highness.
And its sides
can leave the enemy army in
total disarray, Your Highness.
The 'Krouncha Vyooh.'*
*Crane-shaped formation.
This battle formation
of the Pandavas
is advancing towards
the army of the Kauravas
Your Highness.
But what formation has
grandsire come up with
in retaliation to this one,
Sanjay?!
Assume the form of a 'Maha Vyooh!'*
*To block the outflanking move of the enemy.
Crown Prince Duryodhan
shall stay under my protection
in the middle of the formation!
Guru Drona
shall lead us
and protect us from any attack
launched against us!
Dusshasan
Ashwatthama,
King of Gandhar
King Shalya
and King Susharma, attack the
sides of the enemy formation!
The 'Krouncha Vyooh
can be broken
by stifling the neck of this
bird-shaped formation.
Attack!
- Attack!
Attack!
Attack! - All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!
All hail Mahadev!
King of Madra!
Do not mourn the death
of Crown Prince Uttar
because he shall
always live in my weapons!
Prince Arjun!
The army of Trigartha
has been assembled
only to battle you!
These soldiers have
only one goal in their lives
and that is to slay you!
Neither does another warrior
have the competence to kill them
nor do they have the intention
of striking at another warrior!
Do not employ words
to attack me, King Susharma!
Resort to weapons instead!
Friend
it is time to take
the first step to our victory.
That is the sign from Arjun.
The garland of victory
shall await you, dear!
Leave at once!
Charioteer.
Today, you shall get the answer
to yesterday's treachery
King of Madra!
Do you hear that?!
The entire battlefield
is resonating with that answer!
Steer the chariot to the middle
of our formation, charioteer.
One must not battle where
there is mist.
Steer the chariot at once!
What else is happening
in the battlefield, Sanjay?!
Why are you not telling
me anything?!
Nothing is visible in the
battlefield, Your Highness.
The battle formation
of the Pandavas
has been completely
hidden by clouds.
The miraculous weapon
of Prince Arjun
has left the entire battlefield
confounded, Your Highness.
Where is Arjun, Sanjay?
Where is Arjun?!
It is time to take
the second step to our victory.
His Excellency and Guru Drona
need to be separated from
Crown Prince Duryodhan.
Brother Yudhishthir,
are you prepared?
No, Vasudev.
I cannot bring myself
to do this.
I had told you,
brother Yudhishthir
that His Excellency's
ties and his weakness
lie in the fort of Hastinapur.
If you attack Hastinapur
then His Excellency
will leave the battlefield
trailing you.
But we had decided
that the war will be fought
only on this battlefield.
This region of Samanta Panchaka
lies amidst five lakes.
Those five lakes are
the boundaries of this region.
We cannot battle beyond
these confines.
No, Vasudev.
Leaving the battlefield
is not appropriate.
Leaving the battlefield is also
a kind of battle formation
brother Yudhishthir.
Think of it as
a kind of battle formation.
Charioteer
take the chariot forth.
Along with one 'akshauhini
army, Prince Yudhishthir
is exiting
their battle formation
and advancing towards
Hastinapur, Your Highness.
Yudhishthir is advancing
towards Hastinapur!
It is time to take
the third step to our victory.
Brother Bheem
brother Yudhishthir
is going to attack Hastinapur.
Would you not like to deliver
this news to Dusshasan?
Certainly, Vasudev.
My mace shall deliver
the message to that fool!
Sanjay...
Sanjay, what else is happening
in the battlefield?
How...
How can Yudhishthir
leave the battlefield and
attack Hastinapur?
Out of the greed for victory
righteousness keeps getting
sacrificed, Your Highness.
Possibly, the defeat
of the first day
has replaced righteousness
with victory within them
Your Highness.
Sanjay, where is Bheem?
Pick up the mace,
Dusshasan
and remind me once again
about the strength of your arms.
What if I forget about
their strength
while ripping your arms out.
Get up!
King Virat, go and help
brother Yudhishthir out
by proceeding
towards Hastinapur!
In order to help Dusshasan out
I shall stay right here.
Brother Duryodhan!
A very large section
of the enemy army
is headed towards Hastinapur,
brother Duryodhan!
Brother Yudhishthir is leading
that army, brother Duryodhan!
He is headed towards Hastinapur
to indeed attack it, my darling.
Then grandsire will
have to trail
Yudhishthir at the earliest.
In order to protect Hastinapur...
But battling outside the borders
of Samanta Panchaka
is unrighteous!
And brother Yudhishthir
can never act unrighteously.
If you keep pulling the tail
of a cow, my darling
then it too can charge at you.
If he gets
the slightest hint of defeat
then even Yudhishthir
can resort to unrighteousness.
Impossible!
I have firm belief
in Yudhishthir!
He can never act unrighteously!
Your Excellency
belief gives one great comfort
but in the battlefield
disbelief provides one
with great benefits
while belief results
only in losses.
Uncle is correct, grandsire.
Can we gamble in such
a situation?
If your belief
turns out to be false
and Yudhishthir goes
to Hastinapur and slays the King
then what will you do?
I order you, grandsire
to trail Yudhishthir.
Then who will protect you here?
In order to protect
my darling Duryodhan
numerous Maharathis
are present here
Your Excellency Bhishma.
However
over there
Yudhishthir is by himself
and you can slay him
in such a situation.
I order you, grandsire
to trail Yudhishthir
and protect Hastinapur
and the moment
you get the opportunity
you need to slay him.
Everyone in this world is
born with relevant powers.
But fear, endearment
and desire are reasons
that prevent the human
race from making an effort.
Those who don't try can
never succeed, my dear.
But your life could have
been put at risk.
My dear, life is always at risk.
Whenever an attempt is made
the chances of success
and failure
are divided in equal proportions
but if there is no attempt
the chances of failure
become a certainty.
Remember this my children
standing up against someone's
atrocities and injustice
can bring about
only one kind of harm...
At worst, you may die.
But to decide against
making an attempt
out of fear or endearment
can bring about two
certain kinds of harms.
Our soul succumbs
and the tyrants grow
fonder of injustice.
Am I right, my friend?
Please continue with
the tales, sire.
How did my uncle help the
Yadavs become prosperous again.
Prince Abhimanyu,
despite being his elder
I bow down in respect to the
greatest of the Yadavs, Krishna.
Because he has taught all
of us the music of life.
He has made
our lives prosperous.
Not only with money but
he has also left us richer
in the heart,
our thoughts and our souls.
Vrindavan witnesses music,
there is celebration all around.
Flowers add glitter to the trees
the animals seem
delighted in the forests.
The Yadavs have discovered
laughter, happiness
and great luck.
When everyone's feet
discovered dance
the flute came to prominence.
[FLUTE PLAYING]
Krishna, haven't you
begun with the act yet?
It can only begin
when Radha arrives.
[SONG]
Our entire village
can afford to donate 100 cows,
hermits.
That's not acceptable, Nand.
You'll have to donate 1000 cows.
Along with that, you will have
to donate wealth, grains, gold
et cetera in good quantity.
Nand, are you not aware
of Lord Indra's wrath?
The land on which you
reside is Lord Indra's region.
If you go against Lord Indra,
you are bound to suffer.
The entire society contributes
to Lord Indra's yajna.
You are not an exception.
When you went against
a less important king
you were exiled from Gokul
if the Lord of Lords
is upset with you
where on earth
will you find refuge?
But how can we donate
all that we have earned
after an entire
year's struggle, sire.
When Lord Indra killed Vritasur* and saved the human race
*A serpent or dragon, the personification of drought.
humans decided to show
support by worshipping him.
But Vritasur had attacked
the heavens.
Lord Indra had killed
Vritasur to protect himself
and not the humans.
You are an imbecile young man.
You are yet to witness
Lord Indra's wrath.
Hermit, are you saying that we
perform the yajna out of fear?
But fear takes away
from a human's soul.
Only when the devotion
is spurred by love
can the human soul
be prosperous.
What kind of devotion
deprives a man of his wealth?
Young man, your arguments
are pointless.
Lord Indra's yajna will
have to be performed
and it surely calls
for donation.
The yajna will begin
on the full moon night
of the month of asaadh.*
*June-July.
Make sure you are present
there with all the donations
along with the entire society.
Greetings.
Nand,
we'll have to abide by
the traditions.
The world is not run by
young and pointless thoughts.
But father, the only one
who forms the basis of life
should be worshipped.
Why should we worship
the one who threatens life?
What would you suggest, Krishna?
Father, we should
worship the Govardhan hill
which gives life to our cows.
We will surely hold Lord
Indra's yajna but only when
it is done with affection
and respect.
Father, fear cannot
be worshipped.
[MAN CHANTING]
Brother, have a look.
There are ample ghee pots.
Yes.
I can drink more ghee
than Lord Agni.
Okay, brother.
Prove it then.
Chitrar, have a look,
the place of yajna
has woods to be burnt.
Madhumangal, you know what
to do, right? - Yes, indeed!
Balram, shall we go?
- Let's go.
Ominous!
That's an ominous sign!
The holy place of
fire has been spoilt.
The yajna has been corrupted.
But, priest, I had brought
the ghee pot.
Go and bring
another pot of ghee.
Also, bring new offerings
as the yajna will have to be
started all over again.
Go.
- Okay, priest!
Have a look at that.
The children are
stealing the offertory.
Sire, this is an ominous sign.
This is the worst
that could happen.
The yajna has been corrupted.
Nand, you have gone
against our traditions
by paying heed to young men.
If Lord Indra is upset,
who will protect us?
My friend, when the Sun's
heat is at its warmest
and the water on land dries up
who gives us the water?
Govardhan hill.
Who provides us with
vegetables, flowers and wood?
We get all of this
from the Govardhan hill.
I find Krishna's argument
legitimate.
Govardhan hill protects
and nourishes us.
You are a fool!
That hill is just
a pile of rocks.
Lord Indra is a living power.
He is alive!
Look at this, Nand and tell me.
Who is more powerful than Indra?
Reverence is more powerful
than the Gods, sire.
We will not halt
the Govardhan yajna.
[LIGHTING SOUND]
Khirsna has put all our lives at stake.
There is still time.
Seek forgiveness from Lord Indra.
Lord Govardhan, help us.
[YELLING]
Khrisna!
Khrisna!
The Govardhan hill will not able to
stand up to Lord Indra's wrath.
Khrisna, all of us will die.
Khrisna, you have humbled me today.
But that was not my intention.
I was only tyring to boost my own
and my Yadav clan's self confidence.
I am very pleased with you.
I wish to grant you blessing.
If you really wish to bless me.
Then suggest me a way of placing this hill down.
I will surely help you with that, Khrisna.
But the path of rightousness
that you have chosen,
will always be a tough one to tread.
If you part ways with it,
those who seek to follow you
will be left wandering, Khrisna.
I bow down to you.
You may speak first, friend.
Vasudev
I did not know
that you would
break your promise.
I am not breaking my promise,
brother Duryodhan.
You most certainly are,
Vasudev.
When I had come here
your eyes were closed.
And my eyes were closed
even when friend had come here.
But he sat in a place
where I could
see him first.
And it is the fault
of the Almighty
because He has placed
the eyes in front of the head.
A person sitting at the back
cannot be said
to have arrived first.
Vasudev
but all the seats
were placed behind your head.
That is not my fault.
If friend wanted
he too could have taken a seat.
Pride seeks to occupy
the highest place
while love seeks to occupy
the correct one.
I am not breaking my promise.
Then coming to you
with the hope of justice
was futile.
I am leaving now,
Vasudev.
Stop,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.
You had come here to ask
for something from Madhav.
You cannot leave
without asking for it.
That would tarnish
Madhav's reputation.
Then what is the reason
that Vasudev has decided
to fulfill your wish first?
Because friend has come
with a request while you
have come with a plan.
Friend has dedication
in his heart while you
have politics in yours.
Friend seeks charity
while you require support.
If one gets the opportunity
to engage in charity
then one seeks
to fulfill it first.
No other task in the world
is more important than charity.
This is partiality,
Vasudev.
No, brother.
I certainly am partial
towards the person
who forsakes the world
and chooses me.
However, I have
my brother's orders.
So, I cannot be partial today.
Before asking for anything
listen to my decision.
In this war,
my army and I
will not fight
from the same side.
My army will stand
against me in the battlefield.
The Narayani Army of Dwaraka
is like no other in this world.
Each soldier of this one 'akshauhini'* army
*An ancient battle formation that consisted of 21,870 chariots (Sanskrit ratha); 21,870 elephants; 65,610 cavalry and 109,350 infantry.
battles like a 'Maharathi.
He can use all known
weapons of the world.
Defeating this army
is nearly
impossible.
But Vasudev
your competence
is more than that
of your Narayani Army.
You are correct,
brother Duryodhan.
The strength and power
of my Sudarshan 'Chakra
can be matched
only by Mahadev's Trident
and Indra's 'Vajra.
Its blow
scares not only humans
but also the Gods.
The strength of my knowledge
the might of my character
and the energy of my soul
reside in this weapon.
The moment I use
the Sudarshan 'Chakra
there will be annihilation.
Truth-untruth
justice-injustice
weak-powerful...
Everything will be destroyed.
In such a situation
the presence
or the absence of a war
makes no difference,
brother Duryodhan.
That is why,
I have taken the decision
that I shall
not take to arms in this war.
On one hand,
there is
my invincible one 'akshauhini
Narayani Army
while on the other
there is me.
Alone
and weaponless.
Now, the decision rests
with the two of you.
Tell me,
friend.
What do you wish for?
Make the choice,
friend.
My choice is clear,
Madhav.
However, to save your name from
being tainted with partiality
could you please give
the opportunity
to Crown Prince Duryodhan
to make the choice first?
Tainted!
When I was a child,
Mother Yashoda
used to call me 'Kala'.*
*Kaladeva, the black deity.
How can a dark person
be scared of getting tainted?
And it is quite evident
what brother Duryodhan
seems to have chosen.
The basis of choice
of some human beings
is often
the possibility of a benefit
while the basis of choice
of other human beings
is their nature.
And brother Duryodhan
knows quite well
where his benefits lie.
You do know, do you not,
brother Duryodhan?
I most certainly do.
That is why, I choose...
- No.
The first one to choose
will be friend.
You have earned
this right, friend.
Forsaking one's rights
is not called bravery.
Right?
One has the right
to one's property, Madhav.
Love
knowledge
and truth
have their right
on human beings.
You are the embodiment
of love, knowledge and truth.
You are righteousness yourself.
I cannot choose you.
I can only ask for you,
Madhav
but neither out of
the greed of victory
nor the fear of defeat.
For...
For the sake of righteousness
I ask for you,
Madhav.
I ask for you,
Madhav.
You
asked for a person
who has no army
or weapons, Arjun?
Is this generosity
or foolishness?
When the juice of sugarcane
has been extracted
only the juice is of value.
The sugarcane has no value,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.
You are correct,
Arjun.
Vasudev
your one 'akshauhini
Narayani Army will have to
suffice me now.
Splendid, brother.
Brother had said
that neither him,
me
nor our army will fight
on behalf of the Pandavas.
His words did not go in vain
friend had his wish fulfilled
and even your plan
was successful.
Now,
we must see
who gets what
in this war.
Kunti
you must indeed have heard
that the Yadavas of Dwaraka
have decided to take
Duryodhan's side.
Only the army of Dwaraka
will battle along with that of
Hastinapur, brother-in-law.
Today, I am reminded
of my beloved Pandu.
Brother-in-law,
this is the time
when the heart
becomes agitated with
the uncertainties of the future.
At a time like this
one is reminded of the past.
Yes!
You are correct, Kunti.
My heart is full
of uncertainties.
This reminds me of an incident
from my childhood.
At that time,
Pandu
was about three-years-old.
One day, in order to keep
his gold toy safe
he placed it in my hands.
A person who has vision
has a different world than the
ones who are visionless, Kunti.
Even as a child,
I could not know
what a toy was.
I could not
take care of that toy.
It fell from my hands and broke.
Pandu cried a lot at that time.
Then I...
Then I took the pieces
of that broken toy
in my hands
and etched its shape
in my mind, Kunti.
After working hard all night
I made the exact same toy
out of wood and gave it to him.
His joy knew no bounds
that day, Kunti.
He went to everyone and said
that something
that belonged to him
would stay safe
only in my hands.
His joy and faith
had left me feeling
exceedingly happy, Kunti.
I decided right then
that anything
that belongs to Pandu
will not be harmed
as long as I am alive.
But today,
I feel sad
that despite my presence,
I could not keep Pandu's sons
safe from all this.
That is why,
I request you, Kunti
to explain to your sons
to quit being
intransigent about a war
and dedicate themselves to us.
If they die
then my heart will break,
Kunti.
You need not worry,
brother-in-law.
The Almighty himself
has come up with a plan
to keep my sons safe.
They will not be harmed.
Krishna is with them.
Do you not remember,
brother-in-law?
Your sons had tried
to disrobe Draupadi
in the court.
Krishna had left the entire
court bare on its account.
However
he did not let Draupadi
get disrobed.
Krishna is Narayan himself.
The side he is on
is the one that will
emerge victorious.
Kunti...
But Vasudev has decided
not to take to arms
in the battlefield, Kunti.
In such a situation,
how will he aid your sons?
Krishna does not aid anyone,
brother-in-law.
The side he is on
gets aided by
the entire creation itself.
In the battlefield,
all of Arjun's arrows
will transform into
the 'Brahmastra
because he will be
aided by Krishna's powers.
Bheem's mace will strike
like the 'Vajra.
The weapons of Yudhishthir,
Nakul and Sahadev
will wreak havoc on your army
like lighting burns a tree down.
You had once promised
My Lord to keep him safe.
That is why,
today
I have lit these hundred lamps.
I have made an attempt
to keep your sons safe.
When these lamps
almost get extinguished
you will know
that the lives of your sons
are in danger.
Krishna being on their side
will take my sons to victory.
Stop!
What are you doing,
Dhritarashtra?
Who permitted you
to make Duryodhan King?!
Permission!
Does the King of Hastinapur
seek permission before
taking decisions, Your Highness?
Be quiet, King of Gandhar!
I, son of Shantanu,
Devavrat Bhishma
always walk ahead
the King of Hastinapur!
This is my oath!
By walking ahead
on the righteous path
I guide and protect
the King of Hastinapur!
And as he is on
an unrighteous path
I am blocking his way
and protesting against him!
That is why...
That is why, seeking
my permission is mandatory.
But great Bhishma
how can you obstruct
an action of the King?
You have taken an oath
of not going against Hastinapur
and taking to arms.
I have taken the oath
to make sure that
the throne of Hastinapur
is presided over by a competent
and righteous King.
And if I see an unrighteous King
on the throne of Hastinapur
then I shall
indeed take to arms!
And this
does not break my oath.
Does anyone have the competence
to stand up against me?!
Pardon me, great Bhishma
but if I am ordered
by the King of Hastinapur
then I shall indeed
demonstrate my competence.
I do not know
if I will be victorious
on my friend's behalf or not
but in order to protect him
I am prepared to sacrifice
even my life.
Dhritarashtra!
Before the anointment ceremony
order the King of Anga
to take to arms!
And let Prince Duryodhan know
that when it is time
to crush unrighteousness
how fiercely I,
Devavrat Bhishma, fight!
No, uncle!
No!
There was no intention
to insult you.
But uncle
I wish to transfer the duties
of the kingdom to my son
and resort to asceticism.
You may certainly do so.
You are the Acting King
and you may make
your son the same.
But you cannot make him King.
Why can he not do so,
great Bhishma?
There must be a reason.
When he has already been
made the Crown Prince
then what can be the problem
in declaring him the King?
Duryodhan's coronation
as the Prince holds no value.
How can it not hold
any value, grandsire?
You had permitted me
to be coronated as the Prince.
But the first one to be
coronated as the Prince
was Yudhishthir.
The five brothers have died
in Varnavrat, grandsire.
When the first Crown Prince
is not alive
then I am next in line
to be the Crown Prince.
The first Crown Prince
is alive.
Are
you telling the truth, uncle?
The sons of Pandu are alive?
The 'swayamvar' of the daughter
of the King of Panchal
was witnessed
by Duryodhan himself.
Was it not
a difficult competition?
Can the winner
of that competition
be an ordinary 'Brahmin?
That was indeed Arjun.
And if Arjun is alive
then so is Yudhishthir.
Do you believe now,
Dhritarashtra
that making Duryodhan King
is unrighteous?
Now, if
Yudhishthir is alive
then making Duryodhan King
is no longer possible.
Then where are the sons
of Pandu, great Bhishma?
If the sons of Pandu are alive
then do bring them here.
Vidur has gone to Kampilya
to bring them here.
How can we believe
that the Minister
has gone to Kampilya?
He did not seek the permission
of His Highness before leaving.
And even the timpani
were not heard
as a sign of a message
being received.
They shall indeed return.
Soon.
How many days?
How many years?
His Highness
there must certainly
be a time limit.
Yes!
There must be
a time limit, uncle.
Two days, three days, a week?
If the sons of Pandu
do not return within a week
or if there is no news of them
then Duryodhan will certainly
be made the King, uncle.
And at that time
you too must accept
this decision, uncle.
Not a week...
Not even a day, Your Highness.
Listen.
The welcome ceremony
of Crown Prince Yudhishthir
has already begun.
The Pandavas have
reached Hastinapur.
Righteousness is returning
to Hastinapur.
Greetings, His Highness.
Bless you, dear.
Greetings, Her Highness.
Bless you!
Dear Yudhishthir
if all of you were alive
then why did you not return?
Aunt
when something seems righteous
I try my best
to fulfill it with
complete devotion.
Then why did you
change your mind now, dear?
Uncle
during the monsoons
the same plant first
gives birth to new leaves
then to flowers,
to fruits
and in the end, to seeds.
A plant judiciously follows
the schedule of seasons
and a righteous person
follows the path of truth.
Greetings, grandsire.
May you live long!
I have protected
the throne of Hastinapur
so that righteousness
may preside over it
in your form.
Greetings, His Highness.
Bless you, dear!
During the exile,
Lord Ram
had adopted the lifestyle
and mentality of his subjects.
That is why,
he proved to be a fine King.
That is why, we decided
that if brother Yudhishthir
stays in the woods as a common
man amongst the subjects
then he too will prove to be
a fine King in the future.
Greetings, uncle.
Arjun
I have heard that a competition
which could be won only by you,
was organized in Kampilya.
And because of your blessings
I could augment the honour
of Hastinapur, uncle.
Greetings.
Bless you!
Where is Kuru dynasty's
first daughter-in-law, Arjun?
Not the first, Her Highness.
Second daughter-in-law.
During the exile,
brother Bheem
had married
the sister of Hidimb.
And sister-in-law Hidimba
has also given birth to a son.
In other words,
brother Bheem
married an ogre?
Hastinapur, peculiar
is your morality
where Princes marry ogres.
Till the time Hidimba
resides in the woods
you may deem her your wife.
I shall
not deem her son a part
of the Kuru dynasty.
But I can
certainly deem him
my great grandson.
Congratulations!
Greetings, sister-in-law.
Where is Kuru dynasty's
second daughter-in-law
of the next generation?
Where is Kuru dynasty's
second daughter-in-law
of the next generation?
This is the Princess of Panchal
Panchali.
Greetings, Her Highness.
Bless you!
I cannot see you
but your beauty must match
the competence of my Arjun
and I am certain of that.
Arjun.
Come forward, dear.
A newly married couple
is always welcomed together.
Her Highness
all five of us
need to be welcomed.
The five of us have got married.
Where are the rest
of the daughters-in-law?
Uncle
we five brothers
have married Draupadi.
You do not have the right
to the Empress just yet.
For that,
the Empress
must be won by you in the game.
I bet my wife
daughter of the King of Kashi
Bhanumati in this
round of the game!
Sit down,
servant Yudhishthir.
You are yet to play
another round
of the game.
Sit down.
Get up, Your Highness.
Get up.
Defend your honour
while there is still time.
No, Vrushali.
No one can snatch one's honour.
One can only give it up.
And I can give up my life
but never my honour.
You should go,
Vrushali
and pray for the protection
of your husband's honour.
How do I hold on to
the string of control, Govind?
Where are you?
Impossible!
Brother Yudhishthir, you cannot
bet Panchali in the game.
Brother Yudhishthir
do not let my
premonition come true.
Sit down to play the game,
servant Yudhishthir.
That is an order
of your master,
Emperor Duryodhan.
Sit down.
I cannot bet Panchali
in the game.
Do not tell me now
that a husband does not have
the right to his wife.
If the right to the independence
of your brothers
is something that you have
acknowledged
then you must also acknowledge
the right you have
to the independence
of your wife.
It is a tradition
of the Aryan region
that a husband
has the right to his wife.
Go on and play,
servant Yudhishthir.
Bet your wife
in this round of the game!
Do not play,
brother Yudhishthir.
This is not righteous.
Righteousness does reside
in traditions
but not all traditions
are righteous.
Do not play
otherwise the seed
of a great war will be sown
in the court
of Hastinapur today.
Brother, if you lose Draupadi
and her honour today
then the hands that roll the dice
in the game will have to burn!
I take the oath
that I shall burn
your hands myself!
I give you the order
to play
servant Yudhishthir!
Play!
He will not be able to play
because he may have
the right to his wife
but it is also essential
to take pride in her.
And how can someone
take pride in such a woman?
Duryodhan!
Duryodhan!
I curse you
that the day you die
you shall pray for death!
Neither will you be able to live
nor will Lord Yama
give you death!
This curse of yours
does not scare me,
His Excellency.
But this curse shall indeed
yield results, Duryodhan.
Only after pleading for death
seven times will you die!
All that unrighteousness
will assume the form
of pain and suffering
and surround your soul
in your end moments, Duryodhan!
And the Crown Prince is correct.
She is like my sister
because she is the daughter
of my father's friend.
A woman married to five men
and having relationships
with them
is someone I would be
ashamed to call my sister!
Ashwatthama
had you not been my son
I would have cursed you.
As a punishment
for uttering such words
I would have cursed you.
May your entire body
get infested with insects.
It shall indeed be so!
The filth of your soul will
appear on your entire body!
The society will abandon you
but Ashwatthama
you will not be able
to abandon your life!
Why would you
give him such a curse?
If you have such great faith
in righteousness
then go and slay your son.
Before an entire gathering,
when a woman
could insult a warrior
based solely on his caste
and completely negate
the respect and feelings of
others for her selfishness
how can she be a woman of
exceptional character?
King Karna of Anga
if you take such great pride
in your competence
then how can you utter abuses
like a weak beggar?!
Do remember
that you shall lose all your
competence and knowledge
at the time of your death!
Your soul will be depleted
when you die!
It will be depleted!
The desire to have
a moment of righteousness
will surround you in your
final moments, Maharathi Karna
but despair will
weigh your heart down.
Your entire life
will seem worthless
in your final moments.
Splendid.
Marvellous.
So, it has been proved
that servant Yudhishthir
does have
the right to his wife
but pride
lacks in this case.
I indeed take pride
in Panchali's devotion
in Panchali's sacrifice
in Panchali's purity!
Apart from Panchali
there is no other devoted wife
who walks this earth
at the moment
King of Gandhar!
It is said that
at the time of death
every unit of the body
and every particle
fights to live.
Every unit of my body
will fight to win.
I cannot lose Panchali.
Bring new dice
and new pieces.
Only then will I play
the game, Your Highness!
You are a servant now!
An order
cannot be given by you.
Either obey my order,
brother Duryodhan
or sentence me to death
this instant!
These dice
are made from the bones
of my late father.
They obey every word of mine.
Dusshasan
bring new pieces.
Uncle, your magical dice
have been broken!
Take these pieces away
and bring new dice.
The generosity to accept
the request of a servant
does reside in me.
Go on.
There you go,
servant Yudhishthir.
The new pieces
and new dice are here.
Play...
Against the wife
of Emperor Duryodhan
Lady Bhanumati
you need to bet your wife
Draupadi in the game.
Sit down and play,
servant!
Sit down and play,
servant!
Go on and play,
servant!
Go on,
dice.
Twelve.
May servant Yudhishthir
have happiness!
Your wife Draupadi has been
lost by you!
The Princess of Panchal
the Empress of Indraprastha
the great pride of the Pandavas
will enter this court as a maid!
Do maids
not have the permission
to enter
the court,
grandsire?
Attendant
bring that maid Draupadi
to this court!
Just give the Pandavas what
they ask for, Your Highness.
Heed my advice!
Give them what they want
even if it is in excess but
stop His Excellency Bhishma.
Make him the servant
of Hastinapur
so that in the future
going against
any of your decisions
would not be an option for him.
All hail His Highness!
His Excellency
wishes to come in.
Your Highness.
Your Highness!
Greetings,
His Excellency.
I apologize,
uncle.
You may punish me
as you like. I...
I shall accept it, uncle.
Why are you sitting
on the floor, dear?
Sit on the throne.
The King of Hastinapur
sits on the floor
only during a 'yajna.
I am no longer the King
of Hastinapur, uncle.
The right to be seated
on the throne...
I had lost it long ago.
You are the King
and will stay so
for a long time.
Now
according to Vidur's suggestion
the kingdom
needs to be divided.
And you need to give
the Pandavas half the kingdom.
Which part of the kingdom
will we get, uncle?
Is there any other city
in the Kuru kingdom
which we can make our capital?
I know that,
dear.
Believe me.
I have no intention
of being unjust to you.
However
we are being lenient
to Duryodhan.
Of that I am sure.
But my hands are tied.
What do you mean by that?
When one upholds justice
with no love in his heart
no righteousness
or happiness
but has just a fatigue
and the sole desire
to end further labour
and in order to placate a person
when he is rewarded
or given a present
instead of being punished
it is called leniency.
The truth is,
such a situation
is the defeat of
the one upholding justice.
It is his failure.
I have laboured enough,
Dhritarashtra.
Dear
to make sure the Kuru kingdom
always houses righteousness
I have struggled endlessly
my entire life
and taken to arms when needed.
I require rest now.
I...
I shall go away
with Yudhishthir.
You may stay here with your son
and rule the kingdom by walking
on the path of righteousness.
What!
You will go away,
uncle?
If you go away
with that Yudhishthir
then who will
protect my kingdom?
I am...
I am blind.
I...
I have no eyesight,
uncle.
How will I be able
to protect my kingdom?
Who will respect me,
uncle?
If I give Yudhishthir
half the kingdom
then the prosperity
of Hastinapur
will get halved,
uncle.
No...
No.
If you go away
then Hastinapur will be
robbed of its strength, uncle.
It will be robbed
of its strength...
Then what will I do
with such a kingdom, uncle?
I...
Like the roar of an old lion
my voice too
will get drowned,
uncle.
I will have no competence.
No one will be
afraid of me, uncle.
No one will be afraid...
You will have to give Yudhishthir
half the kingdom, Dhritarashtra.
Why should I,
uncle?
Why should I give him
half the kingdom, uncle?
If you go away with him,
he will have the competence.
But what will I be left with?
Weakness?
His prosperity will magnify
with each passing day, uncle
but mine?
Mine will decrease
with each passing day.
Then how will dividing
the kingdom benefit me?
It would truly be just, uncle
when even if he takes
prosperity from me
the strength...
The strength would
remain with me.
Or maybe
he could have the strength and...
And prosperity
would remain with me.
If he gets both then it would be
unjust to me, uncle.
Possibly, you may get
the lesser share
but
if doing so can avert a war
within the Kuru kingdom
and establish peace in it, dear
then you should accept it
whole-heartedly.
This is an earnest request
to all of you from me.
But which region,
uncle?
Is there no region
in the Kuru kingdom
where there is no city?
An uninhabitable place...
A place
which is terrorized
by ogres and monsters.
There is,
Panchali.
The name of that city
is Khandavprastha.*
*It was a forest region (Khandava Vana) on the banks of Yamuna river, in modern day Delhi territory.
Then we shall ask
for that region.
This way, at the time
of the division
there will be no struggle
within the family.
Forget about finding
a city in that region.
There is not even
a hut there, Panchali.
How will you live there?
I am certain you know
how to make a hut, My Lord.
That would be more than
sufficient for me.
Panchali is correct,
Nakul.
Creating something from scratch
is always more gratifying.
And brother Dhritarashtra
will give
that region to you quite easily.
But living there
will be exceedingly
difficult, Draupadi.
But living there
will be exceedingly
troublesome, dear.
Troubles?
Difficulties give birth to glory
fame and prestige.
It is the mother to all three.
We shall ask for that region.
I have no region with me
which I can give to them
and yet preserve
the prosperity of Hastinapur.
If I have to protect my kingdom
then I shall require
prosperity, uncle.
And you have to admit it.
I assure you,
Dhritarashtra
that Hastinapur shall be
protected by Yudhishthir and me.
Whenever you need us
Yudhishthir and I
shall come to your aid.
And Yudhishthir
will never attack Hastinapur.
I believe that,
uncle.
But unfortunately, if such a
situation arises in the future
or my son does
something unrighteous
then you shall certainly
attack Hastinapur, uncle.
You know my son
quite well, uncle.
He knows what righteousness is
but can never act so.
Till date, you have stopped
his unrighteous acts.
In the future, you will
punish his misdeeds, uncle.
No, uncle.
I will never let that happen.
I will never let it happen...
That is why, I have
taken the decision, uncle
that I shall not declare
Yudhishthir King.
I shall not declare
Yudhishthir King...
I will challenge him
to a battle.
He will certainly slay me
in the battle, uncle.
He too is like my son.
I shall place my head on his lap
and bid adieu to this life.
Then I shall certainly
go to heaven, uncle.
I shall
certainly go to...
This decision of yours will
relieve uncle of a great burden.
Because of such benevolence
uncle has decided
to live with all of you.
That is our good fortune, uncle.
This is not only
your good fortune
but also that of uncle.
Do remember one thing.
Uncle has struggled
his entire life.
The number of sacrifices he has
made for the Kuru kingdom
cannot be achieved by a person
in a single lifetime.
Speak clearly,
Dhritarashtra.
What do you want?
All I want,
uncle
is for you to promise me
that under no circumstance
will you quit being on the side
of my sons and me.
Promise me this,
uncle.
Promise me this,
uncle.
Only then will I
divide the kingdom.
Promise me this,
uncle.
Grandsire has served the Kuru
kingdom his entire life, uncle.
Now, we five brothers
and our wife will be
at his service forever.
I have firm faith
that henceforth
grandsire will have to make
no more sacrifices, uncle.
Promise me, uncle.
Promise me.
You are asking me
for another sacrifice, dear.
So be it.
My father named me Bhishma.
In the name of righteousness
I can never tire out
in making sacrifices.
Today, I...
Today, I shall make
another sacrifice.
A container
can be emptied of its
contents only once.
But even after
one keeps drawing out
water from a well
it does not get emptied
because the water in the well
is obtained from
very deep within the earth.
Dhritarashtra
I have to demonstrate
the depth of my soul today.
I have to prove that I can
make numerous sacrifices.
Hence, I promise you
that until you are
the King of Hastinapur
I shall serve you and Hastinapur
as its servant
and deem every word
of yours an order.
As long as you are
the King of Hastinapur
I shall serve you and
Hastinapur as a servant
and deem every word
of yours an order.
Every living moment of my life
will be spent in protecting you.
But today...
Today, you must
divide this kingdom.
And declare Yudhishthir King.
Give the sons of Pandu
just one opportunity
to lead a happy life, dear.
Just one opportunity...
As you say,
uncle.
Be seated on your throne.
Division of the Kuru kingdom!
How is that possible?
Maybe it is their way of ousting
the son of Pandu, Yudhishthir
and keeping him from becoming
the King of Hastinapur.
That is why, by giving
him another kingdom
they are driving him
away from the state.
In other words,
Hastinapur will now be ruled
by the sons of Dhritarashtra!
I will leave Hastinapur
and reside in the new city.
But how can we leave?
Our entire world belongs here.
The ones who can leave with
the sons of Pandu are fortunate.
We would truly be fortunate
when we get to see Crown Prince
Yudhishthir become the King.
Hear all!
Hear all!
The son of Pandu and the
Kuru dynasty's daughter-in-law
the daughter of Drupad,
Panchali
are making their entrance!
My dear
I do not see joy on your face.
What should I
rejoice for, uncle?
That old geyser made
Yudhishthir King
and crushed my dreams
of becoming one forever.
When did I ask you
to experience joy?
But you must pretend,
my dear.
If you pretend to be happy
then you will also find
the reason to rejoice.
Greetings,
His Highness!
Son of Pandu,
Yudhishthir
you may present your proposal
to His Highness now.
If those people are given
the fertile region near
the bank of the Ganges, uncle
then I will break
the peace treaty
and attack that region
tomorrow itself.
Calm down, my dear.
Calm down.
I keep telling you...
The ones who walk on
the path of righteousness
are the most susceptible
to unrighteous ploys.
Just wait and watch.
May the Kuru King
be victorious!
Your Highness, I,
the son of Pandu, Yudhishthir
by respecting your wishes
accept a portion
of the Kuru kingdom
as a part of the treaty.
Allow me to be crowned
the King, Your Highness.
You have my permission,
Yudhishthir.
But
before you are crowned the King,
you must tell me
which region of the Kuru kingdom
you wish to have.
Excluding the city of Hastinapur
you may ask for any other region
of the Kuru kingdom
but its expanse...
Its expanse
should not be more than
half of the Kuru kingdom.
Go ahead and ask,
Yudhishthir.
What do you want?
Your Highness
numerous regions
were made prosperous
with your labour
and if I am made the King
of any of those regions
then it would not
denote my valour.
While transferring
his property to his son
a father feels overjoyed
but when a son
earns his property
through hard work and labour
his father is left ecstatic.
You are like my father,
Your Highness.
I wish to inherit your
strength and competence
and not property.
That is why,
Your Highness
we brothers have decided
that with your permission
we would like to go
to Khandavprastha
and build a new city there.
My dear
did you find the reason
to rejoice now?
Dear Yudhishthir
you do not know about
Khandavprastha.
I know,
grandsire.
The Yaduvanshi King
Sudarshan, had his kingdom
there many years ago.
Lord Indra once
cursed that kingdom
which made all the water
there to dry up.
It was even robbed of the rains.
The buildings of that city
were destroyed by the King of
Kashi with Lord Indra's help.
And the region
was left desolate.
We have taken
an oath, grandsire
that we will
salvage that region.
And try our best to augment the
prestige of the Kuru kingdom.
You will not be able to,
Yudhishthir.
The woods near that region
are home to a small clan
of serpent worshippers.
But they are venomous beings.
The beings there
are against humans.
Their leader is an illusory
serpent called Dakshak
and any human who
goes to Khandavprastha
gets killed by him for he
has taken such an oath.
No human will go with you
to reside over there.
You cannot succeed
in this endeavour.
The basis of success
is the blessing of
one's father, grandsire.
If we have
your blessings with us
then we shall certainly
be successful.
That is a foolish decision,
Yudhishthir!
Your Highness
I have selected a few regions
which comprise half
the Kuru kingdom.
Giving the sons of Pandu
those regions would be correct
and just as well.
Impossible,
His Excellency!
Yudhishthir must have thought
about it before making the plea.
And fulfilling his plea
is my duty, Your Excellency.
Dear Yudhishthir
I give you one lakh* gold coins
and one lakh cows
for establishing your city.
In the Kuru kingdom,
whichever subject
is ready to leave with you
out of his own free will
has my permission to do so.
What kind of a decision is that?
Yudhishthir
I declare you the independent
King of Khandavprastha!
I declare you the independent
King of Khandavprastha!
But do remember, dear.
There is a tradition
of the Aryan region...
Until more than 100 Kings
accept you as a stronger
ruler than themselves
you will not be deemed
an independent King.
You will be an independent King
only for the sake of it.
Your kingdom will have
no flag of its own.
Any oath of office
in your kingdom
will be taken only in the name
of the throne of Hastinapur.
And all the official documents
will be in the name
of Hastinapur as well.
Revered Kripacharya
do begin the crowning
ceremony of Yudhishthir.
As you say,
Your Highness.
May this gold crown represent
your fame,
Prestige
prosperity,
competence
valour and all your rights.
May it adorn the head of
the King of Khandavprastha
the son of Pandu,
Yudhishthir for ages to come!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!
- My darling
just wait and watch
the splendid plan
I came up with
to ensure your safety.
Dear Yudhishthir
your kingdom is now
independent of Hastinapur.
And I have firm faith
that no region of Hastinapur
will be eyed by you any longer.
In order to augment
the boundaries of your kingdom
you will never attack
Hastinapur, dear.
In order to multiply the
property of your kingdom
the property of Hastinapur
will never be snatched by you.
I promise you,
uncle
that I shall always remember
that my uncle Dhritarashtra
aunt Gandhari
uncle Vidur
and beloved Duryodhan
reside in this kingdom.
This is also the residence
of your mother Kunti, dear.
Do not forget that.
What do you mean?
Kunti is the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru dynasty.
After the demise of my
beloved younger brother Pandu
it is my duty
to keep her safe, dear.
Kunti will stay here.
With Gandhari
and in her security.
And this is not an order
of a cruel King
Kunti!
Your brother-in-law
and sister-in-law
are merely making
a humble request.
Come closer...
What is the problem, Hidimba?
Why are you taking so long
to lure these humans?
There is no problem, brother.
I am about to lure them.
Do not try to fool me.
You have done this before.
But you have taken almost
ten hours to lure them.
Why so long?
Never has it taken you
so long, Hidimba.
These...
These humans
are very intelligent.
They refuse to listen to me.
They refuse to listen to you
or do you not want
to take them there?
Have you fallen in love
with that tall human?
If you fall in love with a human
Lord Vrikodar will become angry.
And in order to appease him
I will have to
sacrifice you myself.
You are bound to die
but even these humans
will not stay alive.
So, be prepared
and lure them at any cost
by using your illusion
and bring them to the village.
Understood?!
What happened, Arjun?
Did you find something?
I just saw the
King of the Ogres, Hidimb.
If you fall in love
with a human
Lord Vrikodar
will become angry.
And in order to appease him
I will have to
sacrifice you myself.
You are bound to die
but even these humans
will not stay alive.
Lure them at any cost
by using your illusion
and bring them to the village.
Understood?!
I can smell food being cooked.
There is certainly a village
in that direction.
Look! I can see light
coming from over there.
We should proceed that way.
Brother Bheem is correct.
We should proceed
in that direction.
Shall we go?
You are bound to die
but even these humans
will not stay alive.
Lure them at any cost
by using your illusion
and bring them to the village.
Stop!
We cannot go there.
That is the village
of the ogres.
We should leave
this place at once.
Please come.
You brought us here
with so much effort.
Then why ask us to leave now?
She brought us here,
brother Yudhishthir?
What do you mean?
She is an ogre, Bheem.
An Ogre?
You are an ogre?
I...
A woman who competes
with you in eating
cannot be a human being.
You are an ogre?
Yes.
I am the sister of Hidimb,
the King of the Ogres
Hidimba.
My brother had told me
to bring all of you here.
My brother had told me
to bring all of you here.
We trusted you
but you betrayed us?
You had trusted her,
brother Bheem.
Brother Yudhishthir and I
knew of this from the start.
All of you should leave.
Your lives are in danger here.
I will show you the way
out of this forest.
Please come.
- Be quiet!
Now, no one will believe you.
Please believe me!
Hidimb is the King of the Ogres.
He is very strong.
He will certainly
kill all of you.
I do not want to hear anything!
Brother Yudhishthir,
what are your orders for me?
Please believe me!
Whoever kills the King of
the Ogres becomes the new King.
This is the tradition.
That is why, many people
tried to kill Hidimb
but no one can kill him.
Please come with me.
I will take all of you
outside this forest.
Then will he not punish you?
You need not worry for me.
I shall brave the punishment.
Please come with me.
You need not worry.
Since we have come here
we shall make this forest
safe for all human beings.
What are your orders, mother?
How can I disbelieve
the might of my sons?
And it is the duty of Princes
to provide people
with protection.
Let's go, brother Bheem.
Stop!
If all of you go there
you will be sacrificed
to Lord Vrikodar.
All hail Princess Draupadi!
All hail Princess Draupadi!
All hail Princess Draupadi!
All hail Princess Draupadi!
All hail Princess Draupadi!
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!
I did not ask for you!
The Gods have sent you
because of their intransigence!
The truth is that you are
a symbol of my weakness!
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!
This maiden has been banished
from the city of Kampilya!
All hail Princess Draupadi!
Bless you, daughter.
Pardon the crimes
of your father, daughter.
The haves of
a marge tree are bitter
but the fruits are sweet.
However, the leaves
are more beneficial.
In the bitter words of a father
must certainly lie
crucial lessons of life.
That is why, I can never
be angry with you, father.
You are truly my good fortune.
I asked for lifelong struggle
for you without thinking.
But the capability of
braving those struggles
and even values like
having a pure character
will also be given
by you, father.
And a family that can
offer protection for life
is what Draupadi
needs in her life.
So, make the necessary
arrangements, King Drupad.
Very soon
for Draupadi
you need to have
a 'swayamvar' organized.
Invite the finest royal families
in the whole of the Aryan region
to this ceremony.
The day Draupadi gets married
will be the dawn of
a new era for the world.
You are correct, Vasudev.
The Almighty has placed enemies
sandwiched between rocks.
He has blessed them
with the armour of rocks.
He has blessed a pearl
with the armour of a shell.
The Almighty has given an armour
to every precious entity.
For my daughter,
I wish to find a person
who can become her armour.
One who is the most superior
warrior of the world.
And I have seen only
one such warrior, Vasudev.
He has the glow of righteousness
on his forehead.
He has the determination
of values on his face.
He does not insult an enemy
even when he is defeated.
Accept your defeat,
King Drupad.
Are you not talking
about him, Drupad?
Indeed, Drona!
Him!
Your disciple
Arjun.
