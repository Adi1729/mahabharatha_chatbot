1
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,230
Princess of Panchal

2
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,270
what is the meaning
of coming here?

3
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,290
I wanted to ask you a question.

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,260
I am not obligated

5
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,100
to answer any of your questions.

6
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,330
Is resolving the issues
of sinners

7
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,260
by showing them
how to purify themselves

8
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,170
not the duty of great men?

9
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,190
You...

10
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,260
The sin committed
by all of you...

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,100
What path do I show
all of you to atone for it?

12
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
Now, even

13
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,290
the water I give as an offering

14
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,270
is not being accepted
by Surya Dev.

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,060
After slipping
through my fingers

16
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,090
the water does not mix
with that of mother Ganga.

17
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,130
Princess

18
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,060
all of you

19
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,160
have committed a grave sin

20
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,030
and Hastinapur is being
punished for it.

21
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,090
Now

22
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,960
what path should I
show all of you?

23
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,130
I can only

24
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,100
show you the path to
the God of Death, Yama.

25
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,970
We are ready to follow
any path you show us

26
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,100
but I have a doubt.

27
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
What will Lord Yama
be able to do?

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,230
Yama will be able
to purify your tainted souls.

29
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,930
In other words

30
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,000
even after committing
such a grave sin

31
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,970
it is possible for us

32
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,090
to be pure once again?

33
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,990
Do I have the permission
to ask another question?

34
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,090
Is the other name of Lord Yama

35
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,990
not Dharmaraj?*
*Lord of righteousness.

36
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Then is the righteous path
not that of Lord Yama?

37
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,090
You are arguing
with me, Princess.

38
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,990
Had you known righteousness

39
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,000
you would never have
resorted to unrighteousness.

40
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,160
When one does not know
what righteousness is

41
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,940
how can he follow the path
of righteousness then?

42
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,160
That is the solution
I wish to seek from you.

43
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
If a soul gets purified
after death

44
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,930
then what is the point?

45
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,070
There must be a way
to follow Lord Yama's path

46
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,960
when one is still alive.

47
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,060
The way Savitri had...

48
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,040
She had brought back
her husband from Lord Yama.

49
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,890
The way Sage Udalak's son

50
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,020
Nachiketa had been
offered to Death

51
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,090
but had returned from
the abode of Lord Yama.

52
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,900
There must be a solution.

53
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,930
The principles followed by Yama

54
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,870
are rules on this earth.

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,060
A lotus is born in the mud

56
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,940
but there are
no branches on its stem.

57
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,870
Hence, it does not move sideward

58
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,940
but grows straight up
towards the sky.

59
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,870
This is what rules mean.

60
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,960
One must abide by rules
all his life.

61
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,870
One must deem it sacred.

62
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
And how could you believe

63
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,840
that we chose not to
abide by certain rules?

64
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,930
That we did not take an oath
to make our lives sacred?

65
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,960
You may not have faith
in the values imparted to me

66
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,960
and I accept that.

67
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,890
But you could have had faith
in that of the Kuru dynasty.

68
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,970
It is easy for a tree
to grow on a river bank.

69
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,890
However, a desert

70
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,030
is devoid of water
and has the blazing sun.

71
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,800
For a tree to grow there
is its true test.

72
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,030
And my husbands and me

73
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,870
have followed the righteous path
even in such a grave situation.

74
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,990
You say

75
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,930
that because of our
unrighteous deed

76
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,800
your offering is being rejected.

77
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,760
But what if

78
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,000
by doubting the purity
of the sons of Pandu

79
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,870
you have committed
an unrighteous deed?

80
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,930
If my husbands and me

81
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,740
are entirely guiltless,
oh Lord Surya

82
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,890
then do accept this offering.

83
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I have a request, grandsire.

84
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,700
Do not keep the sons of Pandu

85
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,630
deprived of your blessings.

86
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,500
Hear all!
Hear all!

87
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,830
The sons of Pandu
are making their entrance!

88
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Greetings, His Highness.

89
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,210
Greetings, His Highness.

90
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,210
Greetings, grandsire.

91
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,370
May you live long.

92
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,240
Greetings, uncle.

93
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,280
Bless you!

94
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,110
Your Highness

95
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,050
a while ago, as the palace
in Varnavrat had caught fire

96
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,340
we had to flee from there.

97
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,310
That is why, we had decided
to stay away from Hastinapur.

98
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,270
And deeming us dead

99
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,210
you decided to coronate
brother Duryodhan as Prince.

100
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,140
But now, I am here

101
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,150
to serve you
and the entire kingdom.

102
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,070
Uncle

103
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,050
when an old building
is still standing

104
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:42,180
a new building cannot be
constructed in its place.

105
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,020
Until one harvests
the current crops

106
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,210
one cannot sow
news crops in the field.

107
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,140
That is why, uncle

108
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,050
when the former Crown Prince
is still present

109
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,270
a new Crown Prince
cannot take his place.

110
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,210
I request you

111
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,110
to declare brother Duryodhan's

112
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,210
coronation as Prince
null and void.

113
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,050
I... - Certainly,
brother Yudhishthir.

114
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
The truth is,
the moment you returned

115
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,040
my coronation as Prince
became null and void on its own.

116
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,170
For you, I shall give up

117
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,140
this throne of mine.

118
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,070
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir.

119
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,980
Be seated, brother Yudhishthir.

120
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,070
But

121
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,950
answer a question of mine,
Crown Prince.

122
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,010
Despite having a husband

123
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,040
when a woman has
relationships with other men

124
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,110
she is called amoral.

125
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,920
In the other kingdoms
of the Arya region

126
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,020
such a woman gets imprisoned.

127
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,040
If you face this question
in the future

128
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,040
then how will you
uphold justice, Crown Prince?

129
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,520
I have another question.

130
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,610
In our kingdom

131
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
no matter how gallant
the General is

132
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,610
if he is proved to be amoral

133
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,690
then he gets punished!

134
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,780
If the judge is amoral

135
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,560
then the King punishes him too!

136
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,710
If the Crown Prince

137
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,520
or his wife is amoral

138
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,550
then would punishing them

139
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,520
be correct

140
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,510
or not?

141
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,460
No amoral person is ever given a
position in the state politics!

142
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,620
The position of a Crown Prince
is a sacred

143
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,550
and stately one.

144
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,520
So, would letting
an amoral person

145
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,620
preside over it be correct?

146
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,510
Answer my questions,
Crown Prince.

147
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,550
And Your Highness

148
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
you must then
let justice prevail.

149
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,650
I can answer your questions,
brother Duryodhan.

150
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,510
No need to do that, Yudhishthir!

151
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,380
I banish you and your family
from the kingdom this instant!
