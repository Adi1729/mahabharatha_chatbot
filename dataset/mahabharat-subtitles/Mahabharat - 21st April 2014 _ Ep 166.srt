1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,680
Alright, child.
Do this.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,200
There is a person
at the stables

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,200
who goes by the name of Dhamgranthi.*
*"Abode of a relater/narrator/chanter."

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,240
Go and give this 'laddoo' to him.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,040
Go and give it to him.
Go on.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,120
Dhamgranthi.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,200
Dhamgranthi.

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,120
Are you Dhamgranthi?

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,600
He is.

10
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,400
But Tantripal told me

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
that Dhamgranthi is a person.

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,480
Tantripal has sent
a gram flour 'laddoo'.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,960
Wonderful!

14
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,720
I was wondering
when the 'laddoo' will arrive.

15
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,720
You may have it.
- Won't you have it?

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,680
If I have it,
I will gain weight

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and become ugly like you.

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Have it.

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Even Minister Kank
loves these sweets.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,800
Has chef Ballav
sent him 'laddoo'?

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
How would I know that?

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Your Highness, we have brought
food for you.

23
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,520
Gram flour 'laddoo'!

24
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,200
Who had the audacity
to send me these sweets?

25
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
Your Highness,
if you permit me

26
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,040
may I have the 'laddoo'?

27
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,520
I am reminded of my childhood
while having them.

28
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,440
Of course.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,960
You have made my kingdom
prosper so much.

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
Not just a portion
of my food

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,640
you may even ask for a portion
of my kingdom.

32
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,960
Attendant, keep the food here.

33
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
We will have it later.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
Your Highness

35
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,040
you seem to be distracted today.

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,960
Minister Kank

37
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
my subjects are very upset
over General Keechak's conduct.

38
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,280
But he is the Queen's brother.

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,480
Hence, I can't control him.

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,280
General Keechak is the strength
of our kingdom.

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
The basis of our protection.

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
A tortoise's shell becomes
a burden for its whole body

43
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,120
because

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,680
its shell is its
only protection.

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,440
Meaning?

46
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,680
Your Highness

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,520
a wise king does not depend
on a single source of protection

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,680
for his kingdom.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
He divides the responsibilities
among several people.

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,640
Even you need to do that.

51
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,240
Attendant

52
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,920
has the same food been sent
to the Queen's chamber?

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
Yes, sire.

54
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
Enough. I cannot dance any more, Brihannala.*
*"Large reed" or "having a reed."

55
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
I am tired.

56
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,680
You got tired so soon,
Uttara!

57
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,600
How will you grow strong
by learning to dance?

58
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
Train yourself in warfare.

59
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Only then
will you become strong.

60
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
Alright, Uttar.

61
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,840
If you are that strong
prove it by dancing.

62
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,440
I am a warrior.

63
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't dance.

64
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,480
Knowledge of dance
even helps in warfare, Prince.

65
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
Dance in warfare!

66
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Definitely.

67
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,560
Raise your sword
and try to injure me.

68
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Then, watch the miracle
called dancing.

69
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
Prince

70
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,400
in life, dance is equally
important in times

71
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,720
of struggle and peace.

72
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,880
Remember.

73
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,880
If the joyful 'Tandav'* of Lord Shiva gives life
*Divine dance performed by Shiva.

74
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,040
then the terrible 'Tandav'
takes it away as well.

75
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Gram flour 'laddoo'?

76
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,920
Why do we have these sweets
for our meals repeatedly?

77
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,520
Take them away.

78
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,240
Your Highness

79
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
if you permit me

80
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,040
I wish to visit the town
for a while.

81
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,000
Of course.

82
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,360
Princess Uttara
will rest now.

83
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,120
Malini*
*"Having a garland."

84
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
have you finished
adorning my hair?

85
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,920
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,840
Where are you going?

87
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Your Highness

88
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,360
Today I am observing a fast called 'Yaksh Poojan'.*
*Worship of Yaksh/benevolent nature spirits.

89
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,280
And the sun is about to set.

90
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,880
If you permit me..

91
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,200
May I offer the prayers?

92
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
Wait for a while.

93
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
First, take this vessel
containing liquor

94
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,240
to my elder brother's house.

95
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
Forgive me, Your Highness.

96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,320
But

97
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,800
But I am an expert maid.

98
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,880
My duty is to style your hair.

99
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,400
I can't undertake the task
meant for servants.

100
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,920
No one refuses to obey General
Keechak's order in Kingdom of Matsya.

101
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,840
You are under the protection
of Minister Kank.

102
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,600
And for some reason,
the King is very fond of him.

103
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,200
I am aware of that as well.

104
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,600
But if my brother
gets angry with you

105
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,840
he will have you burnt alive.

106
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,600
No one will be able
to protect you.

107
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,120
Take this and deliver it
to his house.

108
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
Right now.

109
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,200
Brother Bheem

110
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,280
is there any reason
behind sending the 'laddoo'?

111
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I was very eager
to see your ugly face.

112
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,400
But, brother Bheem

113
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,720
elder brother had told us

114
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,760
that unless
it is something serious

115
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,560
you should not send any message
through 'laddoo'.

116
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
But there is a serious problem.

117
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,160
Your waist has become
very narrow, Brihannala.

118
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,760
Eat the food that I prepare
and become strong

119
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,640
as one needs to be strong enough
to face a battle.

120
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,200
Did Panchali not receive
my message, Arjun?

121
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,400
She is the only one
who is yet to arrive.

122
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,360
We had seen the gram flour
'laddoo' together brother Bheem.

123
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,240
But I think

124
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,360
the Queen stopped her
and gave her some task.

125
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Bring that vessel here.

126
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,440
Forgive me.

127
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
I might stumble in the dark.

128
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,400
Let me light up the chamber.

129
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,560
Now, remove this veil,
expert maid.

130
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,440
Otherwise, you will get burnt.

131
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,520
I have already told you,
General Keechak.

132
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,240
I am under the protection
of the immortal Gandharvas.

133
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,720
Fire, poison or weapons
cannot harm me.

134
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,840
But yes.

135
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,680
You should definitely
worry about your well being.

136
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,520
Words spoken behind a veil
echo

137
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,480
and I hear those words
several times.

138
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,440
The results of your sins
will be such

139
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,040
that you will be punished
several times over.

140
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,460
Who are you?

141
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,580
You seem to be from
some royal family.

142
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,860
Such beauty

143
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,540
can be found only among royalty.

144
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,620
Beauty and character are not
bound by any caste or creed.

145
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,260
They can be found anywhere.

146
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,740
And I never lift my veil.

147
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,660
You have not seen
my beauty at all.

148
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,020
I have.

149
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,260
Once, at Sudeshna's palace

150
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,620
I had seen your

151
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,380
beautiful face.

152
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,060
I am enchanted

153
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,740
by your beauty.

154
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,500
I am even ready
to marry you.

155
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,020
I am already married,
General Keechak.

156
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,460
If your husband is alive

157
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,020
then why do you
leave your hair untied?

158
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,860
My husband has taken a vow
of extreme penance

159
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,980
to finish all the sinners
in this world.

160
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,540
I leave my hair untied
at his orders.

161
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,300
Move out of my way.

162
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,220
Foolish maid

163
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,660
if you reject
General Keechak's love

164
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,580
then I will force you

165
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,180
to surrender to me.

166
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,140
The one who touched my clothes

167
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,780
will die a horrific death.

168
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,300
God Himself has granted
this boon to me.

169
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,780
You have made
a very big mistake

170
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,220
by touching my clothes.

171
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,020
Then call your protectors

172
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,700
and save yourself.

173
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,940
I had told you

174
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,740
that I am under the protection
of five immortal Gandharvas.

175
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,820
No one can touch me
against my will.

176
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
Listen to me.

177
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,740
While you are under the protection
of the great King Virat

178
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,300
don't indulge in such sins,
Keechak.

179
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,940
Before the serpents residing
under the ground

180
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,780
the ones clinging to the
sandalwood trees have to die.

181
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,060
You will have to die,
in the same manner.

182
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,180
I am grateful to Queen Sudeshna
for giving me food and shelter.

183
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,700
Hence, I am forgiving you
this time.

184
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,140
Very soon, I'll uncover
your secret.

185
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,100
And that day

186
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,980
you will voluntarily

187
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,980
have to come to me,
for protection.

188
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,180
Yes!
