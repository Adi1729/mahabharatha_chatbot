1
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,450
Come closer...

2
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,150
What is the problem, Hidimba?

3
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,130
Why are you taking so long
to lure these humans?

4
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,190
There is no problem, brother.

5
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,290
I am about to lure them.

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,260
Do not try to fool me.

7
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,350
You have done this before.

8
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,220
But you have taken almost
ten hours to lure them.

9
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,220
Why so long?

10
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,420
Never has it taken you
so long, Hidimba.

11
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,390
These...

12
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,300
These humans
are very intelligent.

13
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,090
They refuse to listen to me.

14
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,250
They refuse to listen to you

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,120
or do you not want
to take them there?

16
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,130
Have you fallen in love

17
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,290
with that tall human?

18
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,190
If you fall in love with a human

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,220
Lord Vrikodar will become angry.

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,190
And in order to appease him

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,320
I will have to

22
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,090
sacrifice you myself.

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,090
You are bound to die

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,320
but even these humans
will not stay alive.

25
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,290
So, be prepared

26
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,180
and lure them at any cost

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,060
by using your illusion

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,290
and bring them to the village.

29
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,220
Understood?!

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
What happened, Arjun?

31
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,160
Did you find something?

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,290
I just saw the
King of the Ogres, Hidimb.

33
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,990
'If you fall in love
with a human'

34
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,090
'Lord Vrikodar
will become angry.'

35
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,060
'And in order to appease him'

36
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,160
'I will have to'

37
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,000
'sacrifice you myself.'

38
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,180
'You are bound to die'

39
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,130
'but even these humans
will not stay alive.'

40
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,130
'Lure them at any cost'

41
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,030
'by using your illusion'

42
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,230
'and bring them to the village.'

43
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,150
'Understood?!'

44
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,960
I can smell food being cooked.

45
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,160
There is certainly a village
in that direction.

46
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,960
Look! I can see light
coming from over there.

47
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,960
We should proceed that way.

48
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,150
Brother Bheem is correct.

49
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,990
We should proceed
in that direction.

50
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,910
Shall we go?

51
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,710
'You are bound to die'

52
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,940
'but even these humans
will not stay alive.'

53
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,670
'Lure them at any cost'

54
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,820
'by using your illusion'

55
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,720
'and bring them to the village.'

56
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,780
Stop!

57
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,650
We cannot go there.

58
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,910
That is the village
of the ogres.

59
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,840
We should leave
this place at once.

60
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,910
Please come.

61
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,810
You brought us here
with so much effort.

62
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Then why ask us to leave now?

63
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,710
She brought us here,
brother Yudhishthir?

64
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
What do you mean?

65
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,870
She is an ogre, Bheem.

66
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,650
An Ogre?

67
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,670
You are an ogre?

68
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
I...

69
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,780
A woman who competes
with you in eating

70
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,620
cannot be a human being.

71
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,550
You are an ogre?

72
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,580
Yes.

73
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,510
I am the sister of Hidimb,
the King of the Ogres

74
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,770
Hidimba.

75
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,450
My brother had told me
to bring all of you here.

76
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,620
My brother had told me
to bring all of you here.

77
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
We trusted you

78
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,550
but you betrayed us?

79
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,410
You had trusted her,
brother Bheem.

80
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,450
Brother Yudhishthir and I
knew of this from the start.

81
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,480
All of you should leave.

82
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,550
Your lives are in danger here.

83
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,420
I will show you the way
out of this forest.

84
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,580
Please come.
- Be quiet!

85
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,410
Now, no one will believe you.

86
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,620
Please believe me!

87
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,420
Hidimb is the King of the Ogres.
He is very strong.

88
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,510
He will certainly
kill all of you.

89
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,380
I do not want to hear anything!

90
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,450
Brother Yudhishthir,
what are your orders for me?

91
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,420
Please believe me!

92
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,450
Whoever kills the King of
the Ogres becomes the new King.

93
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,440
This is the tradition.

94
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,510
That is why, many people
tried to kill Hidimb

95
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,440
but no one can kill him.

96
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,320
Please come with me.

97
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,320
I will take all of you
outside this forest.

98
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,510
Then will he not punish you?

99
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,580
You need not worry for me.

100
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,440
I shall brave the punishment.

101
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,550
Please come with me.

102
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,350
You need not worry.

103
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,410
Since we have come here

104
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,320
we shall make this forest
safe for all human beings.

105
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,410
What are your orders, mother?

106
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,450
How can I disbelieve

107
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,320
the might of my sons?

108
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,320
And it is the duty of Princes

109
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,350
to provide people
with protection.

110
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,410
Let's go, brother Bheem.

111
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,280
Stop!

112
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,440
If all of you go there

113
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,490
you will be sacrificed
to Lord Vrikodar.

114
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,180
All hail Princess Draupadi!

115
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,310
All hail Princess Draupadi!

116
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,180
All hail Princess Draupadi!

117
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,380
All hail Princess Draupadi!

118
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,350
All hail Princess Draupadi!

119
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,180
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!

120
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,280
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!

121
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,410
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!

122
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,210
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!

123
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,380
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!

124
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,180
'I did not ask for you!'

125
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,280
'The Gods have sent you
because of their intransigence!'

126
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,140
'The truth is that you are
a symbol of my weakness!'

127
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,310
All hail Vasudev Shri Krishna!

128
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,220
'This maiden has been banished
from the city of Kampilya!'

129
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,280
All hail Princess Draupadi!

130
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,350
Bless you, daughter.

131
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,250
Pardon the crimes
of your father, daughter.

132
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,240
The haves of
a marge tree are bitter

133
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,170
but the fruits are sweet.

134
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,120
However, the leaves
are more beneficial.

135
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,220
In the bitter words of a father

136
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,250
must certainly lie
crucial lessons of life.

137
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,050
That is why, I can never
be angry with you, father.

138
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,080
You are truly my good fortune.

139
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,140
I asked for lifelong struggle
for you without thinking.

140
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,280
But the capability of
braving those struggles

141
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,080
and even values like
having a pure character

142
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,980
will also be given
by you, father.

143
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,990
And a family that can
offer protection for life

144
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,250
is what Draupadi
needs in her life.

145
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,050
So, make the necessary
arrangements, King Drupad.

146
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,170
Very soon

147
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,150
for Draupadi

148
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,250
you need to have
a 'swayamvar' organized.

149
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,210
Invite the finest royal families
in the whole of the Aryan region

150
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,040
to this ceremony.

151
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,180
The day Draupadi gets married

152
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,180
will be the dawn of
a new era for the world.

153
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,110
You are correct, Vasudev.

154
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,050
The Almighty has placed enemies

155
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,980
sandwiched between rocks.

156
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,980
He has blessed them
with the armour of rocks.

157
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,040
He has blessed a pearl
with the armour of a shell.

158
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,080
The Almighty has given an armour
to every precious entity.

159
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,040
For my daughter,
I wish to find a person

160
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,980
who can become her armour.

161
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,080
One who is the most superior
warrior of the world.

162
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,020
And I have seen only
one such warrior, Vasudev.

163
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,980
He has the glow of righteousness
on his forehead.

164
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,070
He has the determination
of values on his face.

165
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,010
He does not insult an enemy
even when he is defeated.

166
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
'Accept your defeat,
