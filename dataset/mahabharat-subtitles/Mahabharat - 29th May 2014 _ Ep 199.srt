1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,140
In other words, in three days
from now will begin

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,110
the Mahabharat.

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,170
And very soon

4
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,130
the sons of Pandu
will meet their doom

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,370
in this very battlefield.

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,200
The Kurukshetra

7
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,080
after all these years

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,300
will be satiated by drinking
the blood of my enemies.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,230
Crown Prince

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,200
who can ever know
the result of a war?

11
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,270
I know,
Vasudev.

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,070
You may be a great trickster

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,200
but I have unparalleled might
fighting from my side.

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,200
Take a good look at us.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,110
General Bhishma

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,070
who has been blessed
with the boon to die at will.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,270
Guru Drona, who cannot
be slain by anyone.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,230
My friend Maharathi Karna

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,180
whose armour can withstand
the blow of any weapon.

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,980
When a side has
three exceptional warriors

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,140
who cannot be slain

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
how can that side ever meet
with defeat, Vasudev?

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,970
Crown Prince Duryodhan!

24
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,040
The answer to your friend Karna
is Prince Arjun.

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,070
The armour of Maharathi Karna

26
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,170
can certainly withstand
the blow of many weapons

27
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,110
but not that of the Gandiva Bow
of Prince Arjun.

28
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,210
My brother Dhrishtadyumna
was born to slay Guru Drona.

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,080
And His Excellency Bhishma
has made me a promise

30
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,170
that whenever I confront him
in a battlefield

31
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,170
he will not resort to arms!

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,970
And what will your role be

33
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,030
in this battlefield

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,040
Princess Shikhandini?

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,140
As the General of the army of
the Pandavas, King of Gandhar.

36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,080
In other words,
on the very first day of the war

37
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,910
your General,
His Excellency Bhishma

38
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,010
will be stripped of his weapons.

39
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,170
Am I correct,
Your Excellency Bhishma?!

40
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,010
You are correct,
Princess Shikhandini.

41
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,770
Uncle

42
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,900
did you know that

43
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,980
grandsire would never take to
arms before Drupad's daughter?

44
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,930
Yes,
my darling.

45
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,910
The entire Aryan region
resonates of such tales.

46
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,870
In other words, on the
very first day of the war

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,740
will the General of my army
refuse to take to arms?

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, will we get defeated

49
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
even before the war begins,
uncle?

50
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,800
My darling

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,970
before a war begins
in the battlefield

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,870
one needs to come up
with certain plans.

53
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,870
This war is not yours,
my darling.

54
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,840
The truth is

55
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,900
this war

56
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,000
is between me

57
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,770
and Vasudev Krishna.

58
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,740
This is a web of treachery
woven by him.

59
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,810
That is why,
a woman

60
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,810
has been made the General.

61
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,880
However, the ethics
and rules of this war

62
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,940
are yet to be discussed
by both the sides.

63
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,940
The war will begin
after three days.

64
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,740
However, in order to change
the circumstances

65
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,780
I require merely three moments.

66
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,800
Only three moments.

67
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,810
Do not worry,
my darling.

68
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,880
Righteousness will aid you
win this war.

69
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,910
Righteousness?

70
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,900
How can righteousness
aid me win this war, uncle?

71
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,730
The righteousness of
Yudhishthir, the son of Pandu

72
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,910
will aid you win this war.

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
You.

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,870
'Three days before the war.'

75
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,730
Uncle Shakuni

76
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,870
will weave another web
of treachery, My Lords.

77
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,900
The ethics of the war
are yet to be discussed.

78
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,680
He will certainly use treachery
in the discussion

79
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,610
and use it to their advantage.

80
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,870
Do not worry,
Panchali.

81
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,870
Uncle has never had
any faith in wars.

82
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,570
He has always used treachery
to avert a war.

83
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,610
In a war,
his mind stops working

84
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
before cowards give up fighting.

85
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,800
But right before a war

86
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,770
in order to protect oneself

87
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,610
even the mind of cowards
becomes quite sharp.

88
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,840
Panchali's fear is not baseless.

89
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,610
Uncle will certainly weave
a web of treachery.

90
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,730
But this time,
we will not get caught in it

91
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,640
brother Yudhishthir.

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,780
Even if the question
of righteousness arises

93
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,800
we will not get caught in it,
brother Yudhishthir.

94
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,840
Righteousness is not a tie,
Sahadev.

95
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,540
Righteousness is
the other term for liberation.

96
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,770
When it comes to righteousness

97
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,740
one cannot compromise with it.

98
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,730
Only copper

99
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,610
turns green,
yellow

100
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,740
and white under
different circumstances.

101
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,580
However, gold does not
change its colour.

102
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,710
That is why,
gold is so precious.

103
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,570
Let's go.

104
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
It is time for the discussion.

105
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,540
Greetings, Vasudev.

106
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,510
Greetings.

107
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,610
Greetings,
Your Excellency Bhishma.

108
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,540
Greetings.

109
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,700
In the entire Aryan region

110
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,700
the rules of a war
have already been defined.

111
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,540
However, in the discussions
held before a war

112
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,470
those rules are merely
recollected by everyone

113
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,630
so that no person
in either of the sides

114
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,540
has a doubt in his heart.

115
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,580
With the permission
of everyone present here

116
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,610
I wish to put forth

117
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,530
these rules before all
in this session.

118
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,640
Certainly.

119
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,570
Thank you.

120
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,510
It is a tradition
of the Aryan region

121
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,410
that a war begins at dawn

122
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,640
and ends at dusk.

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,670
However,
dusk or sundown

124
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
shall not be deemed
the end of the day.

125
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,440
Only when it is
impossible to see

126
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,600
in the absence of torches

127
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
will it be deemed
the end of the day.

128
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,570
Impossible!

129
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,440
It is deemed the end of the day

130
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,640
when the sunrays
are no longer visible.

131
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,660
The argument over
precisely that point

132
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,470
has given rise to this war,
brother Bheem.

133
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,530
Regarding this point

134
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,600
our decision is crystal clear.

135
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,410
We accept your first rule,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.

136
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,630
But do remember...

137
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,410
If the inability to see
marks the end of a day

138
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,630
then you may stop
fighting for that day

139
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,630
but I shall continue fighting.

140
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,880
If the inability to see
marks the end of a day

141
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,870
then you may stop
fighting for that day

142
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,810
but I shall continue fighting.

143
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I can shoot arrows
even in complete darkness.

144
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,750
You have seen it,
have you not?

145
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,740
Then I suggest
that dawn and dusk

146
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,810
should be determined
by the sound of a conch shell.

147
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,750
The Maharathis
of both the armies

148
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,720
shall begin and end the day

149
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
by sounding a conch shell.

150
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,680
That sounds fair,
Your Excellency Bhishma.

151
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,750
We have firm faith
in your justice.

152
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
My darling...

153
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,770
Your Excellency...

154
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,620
Let us discuss the rest
of the rules as well, Vasudev.

155
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,710
Only one warrior shall fight
with another warrior.

156
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,720
Each warrior shall fight
with a warrior of his category.

157
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,550
A warrior who is
injured, defenseless

158
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,710
or has come to seek shelter

159
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,750
shall not be harmed by anyone.

160
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,650
People who serve
and treat other people

161
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,720
shall not be harmed by anyone.

162
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,680
A warrior who is not present
in the battlefield

163
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,670
shall also not be harmed
by anyone.

164
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,810
A warrior who breaks these rules

165
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,710
shall be sentenced to death

166
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,720
by the General of that warrior.

167
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,520
Since these rules are in
accordance with the traditions

168
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,550
there is no scope
for any argument.

169
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,620
Splendid.
Marvellous.

170
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,510
Now, before ending
this session

171
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,520
I wish to ask one last question.

172
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,610
Vasudev Krishna has

173
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,480
called this region
a righteous one.

174
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,520
So, will all the warriors
participating in this war

175
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,510
act righteously?

176
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,640
Indeed.

177
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Splendid.

178
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,670
Marvellous.

179
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,580
In other words

180
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,510
we have decided

181
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,670
that each warrior

182
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,610
will fight with a warrior
of the same category.

183
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,670
A warrior proficient in archery

184
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,550
will not challenge a warrior
proficient in mace-fighting.

185
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,540
A Maharathi

186
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,480
cannot challenge

187
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,580
a Commander.

188
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,480
However

189
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,480
according to the 'shastras'
and traditions

190
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,620
even the categories
of men and women

191
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,410
are deemed to be different.

192
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,570
If a woman is a mother,
she is revered.

193
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,510
If she is a wife,
she is dear.

194
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,480
If she is a daughter,
she is one's good fortune.

195
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,470
If she is a daughter-in-law,
she is worthy of respect.

196
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,350
Even when one has
an argument with a woman

197
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,620
striking at a woman

198
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,610
is like paving one's way
straight to hell.

199
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,480
In order to appease Maha Kali

200
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Lord Shiva

201
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,650
had lied down defenseless
in the path of the Goddess.

202
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,340
However, He did not employ
might against the Goddess.

203
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,340
So, even when a woman

204
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,380
takes to arms in the battlefield

205
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,510
can any man

206
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,450
ever strike at her?

207
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,470
Only a woman

208
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,470
can fight against another...

209
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,380
So, would it not be correct
to come up with such a rule?

210
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,430
Yudhishthir,
son of Pandu

211
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,270
you are the most
knowledgeable person

212
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,500
when it comes to righteousness.

213
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,430
If you say that in this war

214
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,430
it is appropriate
to strike at a woman

215
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,240
then you would be doing
an unrighteous deed.

216
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,300
And if you say

217
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,200
that it is inappropriate
to strike at a woman

218
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,330
then you would be
making this war

219
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,410
an unrighteous one.

220
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,360
What kind of a question is that?

221
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,240
When I have given everyone
the freedom to strike at me

222
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,430
how does righteousness
come into the picture?

223
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,460
Righteousness and traditions

224
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,330
do not function according to the
will of a single person, Lady.

225
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,360
Yudhishthir,
son of Pandu...

226
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,130
So, what does your
righteousness say?

227
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,140
Have you thought of defeating us
even without engaging in a war?

228
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,240
Because when confronted
with your General

229
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,370
no warrior from our army

230
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,400
will strike at her.

231
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,100
You have upheld righteousness
all your life.

232
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,170
So, in order to be victorious

233
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,160
will you let go
of your righteous ways?

234
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,070
Women will not be able
to participate in this war.

235
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,240
We accept it.

236
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,130
We accept it.

237
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,200
I had told you,
my darling...

238
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,100
The righteousness of Yudhishthir

239
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,040
will become the reason
of your victory.
