1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,450
She had stripped us
of our weapons in the court.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,250
We will strip her of her clothes

3
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,250
before the entire court.

4
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,180
Empress Draupadi

5
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,190
will be disrobed by you!

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,380
Maid Draupadi will be
disrobed by me, uncle!

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,340
Only then will
the fire of being insulted

8
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,180
get extinguished
within me, uncle!

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,280
Splendid, my darling!
Splendid!

10
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,220
A woman having five husbands

11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,410
has no dignity and this truth

12
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,150
will be revealed

13
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,320
before the entire world.

14
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,280
Look.

15
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,380
The Great Guru Drona
is making his entrance.

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,350
All hail Guru Dronacharya!

17
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,250
All hail Guru Dronacharya!

18
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,350
He has come here to see

19
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,110
the glory and respect

20
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,280
of his beloved disciples

21
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,110
but

22
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,220
he will get to see something

23
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,310
which has not been
witnessed by the world

24
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,080
until this day.

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,310
May His Highness have happiness!

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,080
No, Guru.

27
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,290
A disciple does not have
the right to bless his guru.

28
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,150
A river always flows downwards
from its source after all.

29
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,190
Despite garnering such success

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,250
you have not let arrogance
cloud your thoughts

31
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,250
and this makes me
exceedingly glad.

32
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
But do remember

33
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,310
that the virtues
of a successful person

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
do not lessen
the envy of others

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,050
but increase it instead.

36
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,210
The envy people had
towards Jarasandha

37
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,180
was not substantial.

38
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,280
However, the envy
people have towards you

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,120
is quite substantial.

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,050
That is why,
this game of dice

41
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,070
is going to be
played here today, Guru.

42
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,180
I am aware of that.

43
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,280
I am certain that none of you
will resort to unrighteousness

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,250
but you must
promise me something.

45
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,050
If you see something
unrighteous happening

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,250
then you must not pardon it.

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,050
Friend Karna

48
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,140
you must stay prepared.

49
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,120
I do not have faith
in Bheem and Nakul.

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,020
If they lose at the game of dice

51
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,080
then they might
draw their weapons.

52
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,050
I am always prepared
to protect you, friend.

53
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,170
But

54
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,010
the General of Hastinapur
is His Excellency Bhishma.

55
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,210
Before we draw our weapons

56
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,150
we will require his permission.

57
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,110
Grandsire is subservient
to the throne of Hastinapur

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,110
because he is its servant.

59
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,210
If the Pandavas
do draw their weapons

60
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,120
grandsire will have to

61
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,040
fight them.

62
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,180
Dear Duryodhan.

63
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,110
Greetings, grandsire.

64
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,020
Greetings,
His Excellency.

65
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,210
His Excellency!

66
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,140
Listen to me very carefully.

67
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,050
Do not attempt

68
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,040
to taint this ceremony.

69
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,980
You are aware

70
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,920
that I am a servant
to the throne of Hastinapur.

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,980
And now

72
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,020
Hastinapur has

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,150
willingly accepted the reign of
the supreme King Yudhishthir.

74
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,970
In other words

75
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,080
I am also a servant

76
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,010
to the supreme

77
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,980
King Yudhishthir now.

78
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,110
If Emperor Yudhishthir
meets with improper behaviour

79
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,010
or is made to face injustice
or any form of treachery

80
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,080
I will have to draw my weapon
in order to protect him.

81
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,950
I hope

82
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,850
you understand.

83
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,920
Indeed, grandsire.

84
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,850
But I am conducting
this ceremony

85
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,050
to forget the past
and bury the hatchet.

86
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,880
I had misbehaved
with Empress Draupadi

87
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,050
and this is its penance,
grandsire.

88
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,080
All I have in my heart
for the Pandavas

89
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,980
is love.

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,910
And may it stay the same.

91
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
That is in the best
interest of everyone.

92
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,810
Uncle.

93
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,850
This is what I had feared,
my darling.

94
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,050
For some reason or the other

95
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,820
that old geyser

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,950
always starts to preach
about righteousness

97
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,750
but

98
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,010
you need not worry, my darling.

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,880
I will find such a cure
for that old geyser

100
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,950
that the very definition
of righteousness

101
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,840
will have to be changed by him.

102
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,980
May His Highness have happiness!

103
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,770
With the permission
of His Highness

104
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,910
let the game of dice begin!

105
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,710
Grace the seat.

106
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,810
Come here,
brother Duryodhan.

107
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,940
Let's begin the game.

108
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,840
Greetings,
Your Highness.

109
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,940
With your permission

110
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,820
uncle would like
to say something.

111
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,680
Certainly.

112
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,650
Your Highness

113
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,680
in the world,
the game of dice

114
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,850
has a very bad reputation.

115
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,680
The thing is,
all the games

116
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,750
which have unclear rules

117
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,750
tend to be bad in general terms.

118
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,680
Even a life without rules

119
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,680
tends to be painful.

120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,620
Your Highness

121
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,710
that is why,
before beginning the game

122
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,810
the rules of this game
need to be clarified.

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Tell me,
King of Gandhar.

124
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,850
What are the rules?

125
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,880
Me?

126
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
No, Your Highness.

127
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,680
In order to come up
with the rules

128
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,650
one needs to have deep knowledge
of righteousness.

129
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,710
One needs to be fair-minded.

130
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,620
One needs to be experienced.

131
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,750
And righteousness,
fair-mindedness and experience

132
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,840
are embodied by none other

133
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,620
than His Excellency Bhishma.

134
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,810
His Excellency

135
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,740
I request you

136
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,640
to explain the rules

137
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,640
of this game

138
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,590
so that when the game begins

139
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,670
you have

140
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,650
nothing to say against it.

141
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,680
Do I have the permission
of His Highness?

142
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,550
Certainly.

143
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,580
Grandsire explaining
the rules of the game

144
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,620
would be best.

145
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,740
Pardon me,
Your Highness.

146
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,740
The game of dice

147
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,620
does not honour
the labour and competence

148
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
of a person.

149
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,610
It is a slave to fortune.

150
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,520
That is why

151
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,720
I do not approve of

152
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,740
this game.

153
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,770
But Your Highness

154
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,580
wise people say that something
orchestrated by the Almighty

155
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,770
for us is called fortune.

156
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,570
King of Gandhar!

157
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,520
Fortune is not something
that is unrighteous!

158
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,690
However, toying with
one's fortune certainly is.

159
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,480
And Your Highness

160
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,540
what rules

161
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,640
can be made for
such an unrighteous deed?

162
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,740
Come up with such rules,
grandsire

163
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,580
which can restrain
unrighteousness.

164
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
Come up with such rules,
grandsire

165
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,500
which can restrain
unrighteousness.

166
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,470
Then lend an ear to me.

167
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,430
First and foremost,
Your Highness

168
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,380
the ones to be most hurt
by unrighteousness in the world

169
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,430
are women.

170
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,510
And the recipients
of grave injustice

171
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,430
are again women.

172
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,330
That is why,
until this game of dice is over

173
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,340
none of the women

174
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,400
will be present in the court.

175
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,480
How is this correct,
grandsire?

176
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,400
All these arrangements
have been made

177
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,410
to honour the Empress after all.

178
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,340
Her presence in the court

179
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,430
is essential, grandsire.

180
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,510
Then this game of dice shall
not be played, Crown Prince.

181
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Because I have firm faith

182
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,240
that the Empress

183
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,240
would appreciate music

184
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,310
more than a game of dice.

185
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,440
Oh no,
Your Excellency!

186
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,280
Her Highness has made
arrangements for the Empress

187
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,340
to see a host of apparels
and jewellery.

188
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,270
Besides, my darling!

189
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,370
Apart from their husbands
and maids, women of royalty

190
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,440
do not play a game of dice
with anyone else!

191
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,410
Your Excellency,
that is a valid rule.

192
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,170
But

193
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,210
the Emperor would require
some light meal during the game

194
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,310
for which the maids

195
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,400
ought to have permission
to enter the court.

196
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,300
This is what I request of you.

197
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,210
That sounds fair.

198
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,310
When called for

199
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
maids will have permission
to enter the court.

200
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,310
Your Highness,
the second rule will be

201
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
that both the players

202
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,140
in each of the turns

203
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,210
must only bet

204
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,200
objects of equal worth
in the game.

205
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,210
When one bets jewellery

206
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,310
only jewellery of equal worth

207
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,300
can be bet by the other.

208
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,270
That sounds fair, grandsire.

209
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,340
The third rule will be

210
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,240
that both the players

211
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,230
can only bet

212
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,100
those objects or items

213
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,310
to which

214
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,300
they have a right.

215
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,070
But the Emperor has the right

216
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,300
to the entire Aryan region,
grandsire.

217
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,240
But you do not have the right
to even a single village.

218
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,340
I am the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur, grandsire

219
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,170
and the throne of Hastinapur

220
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,180
rightfully belongs to me.
- In time.

221
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,240
And when it is time

222
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,270
we shall invite the Emperor
for a game of dice again.

223
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,070
But at the moment

224
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,170
you can only bet

225
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Your apparels

226
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,140
jewellery
and gold coins in the game.

227
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,200
Objects of equal worth

228
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,140
will be bet by
the Emperor as well.

229
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,230
But grandsire

230
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,180
because of this rule,
winning and losing at this game

231
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,100
will have absolutely no meaning.

232
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,110
The game will be over
in just a few turns, grandsire.

233
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,110
Then what is

234
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,010
incorrect about it,
Crown Prince?

235
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,200
Do you not want
this game to take place?

236
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,200
I do not, Duryodhan.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,030
Stop the game.

238
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,120
Stop the game.

239
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,090
I

240
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,890
apologise to Yudhishthir

241
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,960
on behalf of Hastinapur.

242
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,930
That is impossible!

243
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,830
I will not let this ceremony
get ruined, grandsire.

244
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,020
Do you have some sort of a plan,
brother Duryodhan

245
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,930
which is being obstructed
by these rules?

246
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,860
It is our plan
to please the Emperor

247
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,050
Prince Bheem.

248
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,060
And no rule
is an obstruction here.

249
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,920
Your Highness

250
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,830
with your permission

251
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,800
I would like to make a request.

252
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,860
Certainly.

253
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,830
Your Highness

254
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,990
be it a battle

255
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,930
a competition
or the game of dice

256
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,950
to a competent person,
these are nothing but games.

257
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,930
Then why do we play these games?

258
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
For wealth or for an empire?

259
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,020
No, King of Gandhar.

260
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,830
Upon being victorious

261
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,020
one garners glory, fame
and praise from the world.

262
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,760
The Emperor is correct.

263
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,950
No one is more intelligent
than the Emperor.

264
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,900
When man wins, there is
an appreciation in his pride

265
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,800
but when he loses, there is
a reduction in his pride.

266
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,790
The true property of man

267
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,860
is his pride.

268
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,950
Did I say something incorrect,
Your Highness?

269
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,860
You are correct,
King of Gandhar.

270
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,930
Pride is everything.

271
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,830
Then I request,
Your Highness

272
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,760
both the players

273
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,990
to bet their pride in the game.

274
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,790
But only to which they have
a right, Your Excellency.

275
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,890
And along with the right to it,
they ought to take pride in it.

276
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,860
Your Highness, such an object
can be bet in the game.

277
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,730
And out of the two players

278
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,830
when one of them

279
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,720
has no object in his possession

280
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,850
which he can take pride in

281
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,730
the game will be
deemed complete.

282
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,950
Brother Yudhishthir

283
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,820
what exactly does
brother Duryodhan possess

284
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,820
which fulfill
both these criteria?

285
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,750
We are aware of no such thing.

286
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,700
But we are well aware

287
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,820
of what the Emperor possesses,
Prince Sahadev.

288
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,820
The Emperor possesses
the entire Aryan region

289
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,820
in which he takes pride.

290
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,860
And whether beloved Duryodhan

291
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,930
can have possession

292
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,850
of even a handful of land

293
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,860
is certainly a question.

294
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,790
So, Your Highness...

295
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,660
Do you approve of these rules?

296
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,680
I approve of them.
