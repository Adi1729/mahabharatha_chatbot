1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,320
What have you done, uncle?

2
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,400
What kind of a plan is this?

3
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,460
We had come here
to form an alliance

4
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,360
but have become
captives instead!

5
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,260
In both politics and gambling

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,270
the dice keep changing
constantly, my darlings!

7
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,260
According to the numbers
being rolled out

8
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,400
one must change one's tactics!

9
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,160
But how can
Jarasandha's Rajsuya 'Yajna'

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,250
be of such great value, uncle?

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,260
The Pandavas.

12
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,130
Before the Pandavas perform
the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

13
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,300
and become independent from
the kingdom of Hastinapur

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,260
it is important

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,260
for Jarasandha to perform
the Rajsuya 'Yajna.'

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,260
We cannot attack
the city of Dwaraka

17
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,270
because Dwaraka

18
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,330
is our family now.

19
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,160
However

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,230
after performing
the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

21
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,130
and declaring himself

22
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,220
the undefeated Emperor
of the Aryan region

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,390
if King Jarasandha
orders us to do so

24
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,230
then we will have to,
my darlings!

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,360
First of all

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,160
despite being guests at Dwaraka

27
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,160
we were insulted by Krishna

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,360
for which we must
take revenge from him!

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,390
And second

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,100
we must snatch from the Pandavas

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,130
their beloved city
of Indraprastha!

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,070
We will certainly take revenge
from the Yadavas

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,260
but

34
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,330
how can we have the city
of the Pandavas, uncle?

35
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,260
Who will fight
on behalf of Hastinapur?

36
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,320
The Pandavas have not yet

37
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,130
become
independent, my darling!

38
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,170
Krishna will be

39
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,300
pitted against Arjun
in the battle.

40
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,290
If that happens

41
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,200
then the Pandavas

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,320
will renounce their kingdom.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,300
The annihilation of the Yadavas

44
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,090
and the hold over Indraprastha

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,160
will both fall into our laps.

46
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,260
Have you taken a look
at Jarasandha's army, uncle?

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,200
His army is a miserable one.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,060
Jarasandha's might
has made him so arrogant

49
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,070
that he has not even assembled
an army of brave warriors.

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,260
Then how could he understand the
importance of a Rajsuya 'Yajna?'

51
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,070
Shukra!

52
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,160
My friend

53
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,060
you must deliver
a message for us.

54
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,160
Go on, my friend.

55
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,160
Go on.

56
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,100
Where are you going
at this hour, My Lord?

57
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,060
The Crown Prince
is in danger, Vrushali.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,900
I have to go to Magadha
to help him.

59
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,970
But you had renounced
the kingdom, My Lord.

60
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,120
I had renounced the kingdom

61
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
but not my friendship.

62
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,020
Regardless of a rider
on the back of a horse

63
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,100
until the reins are
present in its mouth

64
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,930
it cannot be truly free.

65
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,050
And I shall indeed
be bound by it, Vrushali.

66
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,890
Forever...

67
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,090
My friend has helped me
on numerous occasions.

68
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,030
Protecting him when he is in
danger is my duty.

69
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,990
Pardon me, My Lord!

70
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
I do not wish to come
in the way of your duty

71
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,060
but...

72
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,000
But I am exceedingly frightened!

73
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,900
This is the lifestyle of Kings!

74
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,020
They venture out every day
seeking danger.

75
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,960
You have taken to arms
for them today.

76
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,860
If need be, My Lord

77
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,990
will you bear a crown again
for them in the future?

78
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,090
Do not argue
unnecessarily, Vrushali.

79
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,090
This is coming in the way
of carrying out my duty.

80
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,030
Pardon me, My Lord!
I-I am with child!

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,020
Your child will be
born very soon.

82
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,830
The entire army of Hastinapur
is there to protect your friend

83
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,830
but the person to safeguard
me and my happiness

84
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,900
is only you, My Lord.

85
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,020
The gates will seem

86
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,990
like a wall to the onlookers

87
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,930
and the wall will seem
like the gates to them.

88
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,990
Areas containing water will seem

89
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,700
like solid ground
to the onlookers

90
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,770
and solid ground will seem
like areas containing water.

91
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,700
Such extraordinary
illusions will be

92
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
created by Mayasur for our city.

93
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,760
All the Kings arriving
for the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

94
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,960
will burn with envy
upon seeing our prosperity.

95
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,760
What is the need for such
grandiose construction, Arjun?

96
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,920
Vasudev can never suggest
to construct something

97
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,960
that can give rise
to envy within people.

98
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,890
Madhav just arrived,
brother Yudhishthir.

99
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,900
He will explain us
what his suggestion meant.

100
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,770
How did Vasudev come to know

101
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,860
that we require his suggestion?

102
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,860
It is said that at the time
of his birth, Madhav

103
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,690
had broken his prison cell.

104
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,890
That is why, be it a prison
of bricks or that of a heart

105
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,770
Madhav always comes to know
who the prisoner is.

106
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Punish them!
Punish them, Your Highness!

107
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,790
Punish them!
Punish them, Your Highness!

108
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,940
Punish them... - What kind
of a gamble is this, uncle?

109
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,880
My darling...- Punish them...
life is a game of dice

110
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,870
and

111
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,910
the person who is
acquainted with his dice

112
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,750
can never be defeated.

113
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,820
The King of Anga.

114
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,810
These are not arrows,
Emperor Jarasandha

115
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,680
but the rays
of Lord Surya himself

116
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,710
and no one can stop them!

117
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,610
If you dare

118
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,840
then stop them!

119
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,680
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

120
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,750
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

121
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,750
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

122
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

123
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,650
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...

124
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,740
That is Maharathi Karna,
Emperor Jarasandha.

125
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
In order to help his friend

126
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,620
he will spend his entire life

127
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,520
shooting at you and leaving you
incapacitated under a net!

128
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,610
Your arrogance will corrode.

129
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,480
You will be robbed
of your strength.

130
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,520
Even your instinct
of self-defense will cave in

131
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,610
but the friendship of
Maharathi Karna never will.

132
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,550
Emperor, your might

133
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,610
and the competence
of Crown Prince Duryodhan

134
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,540
are differentiated
solely by this.

135
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,680
Competence is something

136
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,610
that creates something new

137
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,480
while might is something
that breaks someone's creation.

138
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,620
Both are essential

139
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,410
but the importance

140
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,580
of competence is way higher.

141
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,680
Now that you are going to
perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

142
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,440
it is essential

143
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,650
for all the Kings
of the Aryan region

144
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,620
to acknowledge your competence.

145
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
That is why

146
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,480
I had suggested you to create
such a grandiose structure.

147
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,470
But Vasudev

148
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,410
the people who see
such a grandiose structure

149
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,450
will certainly
be filled with envy.

150
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,410
Upon seeing any great structure

151
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,410
the subjects of that kingdom

152
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,450
are filled with pride.

153
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,420
When prosperity is apparent

154
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,440
in order to make the kingdom
more prosperous, the subjects

155
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,410
are always prepared.

156
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,410
The competence of a King
lies neither in his army

157
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,440
nor in the strength of his
allies and his sense of control.

158
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,380
The competence of a King

159
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,580
lies in the sense of pride his
subjects have for the kingdom

160
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,480
in the faith of his friends

161
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,350
and in the envy of his enemies.

162
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,570
The competence of a King
lies in his army

163
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,520
in his allies

164
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,550
and in his sense of control.

165
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,470
You have had the entire
Aryan region terrorized

166
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,570
but where is your
sense of control?

167
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,470
Who is the person

168
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,380
who makes certain
that even in far-off places

169
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,480
your orders are
obeyed by people?

170
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,450
That is why

171
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,310
Emperor Jarasandha

172
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,540
you have not yet been

173
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,540
able to kill Vasudev Krishna.

174
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,560
Who is the person who makes certain
that even in far-off places

175
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,330
your orders are
obeyed by people?

176
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,360
That is why

177
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
Emperor Jarasandha

178
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,390
you have not yet been

179
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,430
able to kill Vasudev Krishna.

180
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,390
The killing of Jarasandha

181
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,330
will be a demonstration
of your might

182
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,550
and the construction
of a grandiose court

183
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,450
will be a symbol
of your competence.

184
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,490
When you shall accomplish
both these tasks

185
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,550
all the Kings
of the Aryan region

186
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,520
will deem you
the undefeated Emperor.

187
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,260
But without the order
from Hastinapur

188
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,520
we cannot attack Magadha.

189
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,490
We have heard that
the King of Gandhar Shakuni

190
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,400
and Duryodhan have
gone to Magadha

191
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,390
with the proposal
to form an alliance.

192
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,400
But they can form an alliance

193
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,260
only when grandsire
will go to Magadha himself

194
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,390
approach Jarasandha and accept
a lower position in his court.

195
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,220
But brother Yudhishthir

196
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,300
in exchange of accepting
that lower position

197
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,260
when the Kuru flag will be
hoisted on the palace of Magadha

198
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,490
grandsire will
indeed be pleased.

199
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,320
If you allow us then before
we become independent

200
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
we shall annex
Magadha to Hastinapur.

201
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,330
Just give us the order
to attack, brother Yudhishthir.

202
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,420
I am getting restless
to put an end to Jarasandha.

203
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,330
People who can make
everyone obey your orders

204
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,450
are warriors
like Maharathi Karna

205
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,250
and you require such people!

206
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,260
He can go to far-off places

207
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,230
and make people
obey yours orders.

208
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,290
That is why

209
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:42,300
you must become
the undefeated Emperor.

210
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
Only then,
Emperor Jarasandha

211
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,230
will you be able to kill

212
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,420
Vasudev Krishna

213
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,460
and annihilate the Yadavas

214
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,420
while we will be able
to take over Indraprastha

215
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,290
and annihilate the Pandavas.

216
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,350
This is the labyrinth

217
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,360
of politics

218
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,200
Emperor Jarasandha

219
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,350
and no one can
navigate through it.

220
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,250
You truly are

221
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,220
very intelligent,
King of Gandhar

222
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,190
Shakuni.

223
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,160
Conducting the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

224
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,130
will be my first step
to attacking Dwaraka

225
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,300
for this is undoubtedly
a splendid opportunity.

226
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,160
100 Kings who are
allies to the Yadavas

227
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,090
will be killed by me first

228
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,250
in order to perform the Narmedha 'Yajna.'*
*Self sacrificing.

229
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,120
And in place of
the 101st sacrifice

230
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,200
will be Vasudev Krishna!

231
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,290
Brother Yudhisthir

232
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,190
your army shall indeed
be victorious.

233
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,100
Putting Jarasandha to an end

234
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,360
will be the beginning
of your Rajsuya 'Yajna.'
