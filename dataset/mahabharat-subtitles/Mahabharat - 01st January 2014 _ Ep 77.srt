1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,230
Your Grace, the minister
has sent this gift for you.

2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,190
What is this, liege?
- This is a bag of rice.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,130
Did he not send jaggery
and clarified butter along?

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,190
I could have made an excellent
'Kheer' if he did.

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,070
If you soak the rice overnight,
and fry it in the butter

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,260
in the morning and
then add jaggery to it

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,060
it makes for an excellent
'Kheer', mother.

8
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,930
Hah! There was a rat
in the bag of rice.

9
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,970
Bhima's 'Kheer' became
impure even before it was made.

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Nothing becomes impure

11
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,130
because of an innocent creature,
Sahadev.

12
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,940
Only man can make things impure,
with his deeds.

13
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,100
But

14
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,060
why did uncle send
this rat as a gift?

15
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't think he meant
to send us a rat.

16
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,060
The rat must have
stumbled into the bag.

17
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,930
Yes.

18
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,970
I'm sure that rice is not
readily available here

19
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,100
hence, this was sent from
Hastinapur, for the princes.

20
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,860
Is there anything else, leige?

21
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,960
Please keep this is mind,
Your Grace

22
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,870
that even if one grain of
rice falls to the ground

23
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,830
it can manifest itself in
hundreds, in the future.

24
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,830
I take your leave, Your Grace.
Your Highness.

25
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,990
'Even if one grain of
rice falls to the ground'

26
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,960
'it can manifest itself in
hundreds, in the future.'

27
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,740
My child.

28
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,960
Are you looking at this moon?

29
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,830
It was full moon,
some nights past

30
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,960
How luminous it was.

31
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,800
And now, only a part of
its luminousity remains.

32
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,930
Tomorrow,
even this, would be lost.

33
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,740
For tomorrow, is the
night, of the new moon.

34
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,860
Just this way, the luminousity
from lives of the Pandavas

35
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,770
will be extinguished tomorrow.

36
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,830
Uncle, Lord Ram was

37
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,930
victorious on new moon

38
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,770
and the whole world celebrates

39
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,800
that night as 'Diwali'.*
*The "festival of lights", spiritually signifies victory.

40
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,870
The new moon, tomorrow

41
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,730
will be a 'Diwali'
for us as well.

42
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,900
Of course, my child, of course.

43
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,760
But, only if your friend, Karna

44
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,700
doesn't put a
spanner to the works.

45
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,900
Only then, will all our wishes
come to fruition.

46
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,760
Uncle,
I have complete faith in Karna.

47
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,800
My child.

48
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,630
If you have faith in him

49
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,800
than I have nothing
to worry about.

50
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,630
For tomorrow

51
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,640
Purochana will set the
'Lakshagraha' on fire.

52
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,710
Now, there is no escape,
for your enemies.

53
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,800
No one can save them.

54
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,800
Greetings, Your Grace.

55
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Adhiratha,
your charioteer, is here.

56
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,830
Adhiratha? At this time?

57
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,640
Send him in.
- Yes, Your Grace.

58
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,700
What's the matter, Adhirath?

59
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,760
You don't even

60
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,800
bow before me now.

61
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,760
Leave us!

62
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,470
I need to be pure myself

63
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,730
before I bow before you.

64
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,600
I feel

65
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,660
very unclean today.

66
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,660
My soul is stained.

67
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,730
I don't have the right
to bow before you.

68
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,530
I'm here to tell you

69
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,670
that I wish to leave

70
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,600
your services

71
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,630
and Hastinapur.

72
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,590
It's the lay of the land,
Adhiratha

73
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,540
that, a boy endures pain,
because of his friends

74
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,500
an adolescent,
for his lover

75
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,590
a married man,
for his in-laws

76
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
and an old man

77
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,600
for his children.

78
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,570
There is no such unction,
which can allay this pain.

79
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,630
I'm certain that

80
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,470
your son is the cause
of your pain, Adhiratha.

81
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,540
Tell me the truth, Adhiratha.

82
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,400
What has your son done?

83
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,630
Don't be silent.

84
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,460
I'm waiting.

85
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,440
Your Grace, Karna is innocent.

86
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,390
If that's true,
then your sorrow is unfounded

87
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,490
Tell me the truth, Adhiratha.

88
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,600
How has Karna hurt you?

89
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,470
Your Grace,

90
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,300
he is bound by
his pledge of friendship.

91
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,590
He hasn't said anything clearly.

92
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,590
But something is amiss
at Varnavart.

93
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,370
Something will come to
pass with the Pandavas

94
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,340
which will be an iniquity,
for even Karna.

95
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,780
But something is amiss
at Varnavart.

96
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,750
Something will come to
pass with the Pandavas

97
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,910
which will be an iniquity,
for even Karna.

98
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,720
And I will not let
that iniquity happen.

99
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,750
Krishna shaved Rukmi's
head with his discus.

100
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,880
Now he won't try to make
alliances with Dwarka.

101
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,750
What's wrong, brother?

102
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,810
Not worried. I was wondering

103
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,710
why uncle sent a rat.

104
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,780
What is he trying to tell us?

105
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm sure he's trying
to tell Nakula

106
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,920
that no matter how much
he stand there with the rat

107
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,740
in front of the mirror
he won't be any beautiful.

108
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,810
Leave the mirror alone.

109
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,910
Don't you get tired,
looking at yourself.

110
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,810
What's there to get tired,
brother?

111
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,880
Even you look at yourself in the
mirror, when you have the time.

112
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,670
I look at my arms.

113
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,870
Yes,
one looks at what he possesses.

114
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,650
Now your face is
nothing to look at.

115
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,810
Arjuna face was worth looking at

116
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,810
when he dressed up as a girl.

117
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,720
Our mother will be
saddened to know that

118
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,810
the strongest man in the world

119
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,710
is reduced to being a mere cook.

120
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,720
Just like a beautiful and
graceful wife.

121
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,710
Arjuna!

122
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,750
Bhima! Bhima! Bhima!

123
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,680
Bhima!

124
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,670
Bhima

125
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,650
Bhima, go and see whether
the food is cooked or not.

126
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,610
Even you, brother!

127
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,810
It's nothing like that.

128
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,780
It's time to eat,
that's why I asked you.

129
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,750
Go.
- Come, Sahadeva.

130
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,580
Go, Bhima.
Cook the food.

131
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,670
Uncle.

132
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,610
Brother! Brother!

133
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,620
Grand uncle Bhishma has left
for Varnavart, in a hurry.

134
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,270
How did grand uncle
come to know of this?

135
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,340
The biggest of ships are sunk

136
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,280
because of one hole
in its starboard.

137
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,340
Even your plan has a hole.

138
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,220
Your friend.

139
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,150
I can't believe that

140
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,170
Karna has left our side

141
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,140
and has gone to help
those Pandavas, uncle.

142
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,320
No, this cannot be.

143
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,280
My child, I never said
that he has left your side.

144
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,050
But he can't let go of
his principles as well.

145
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,170
This is his deference.

146
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,110
I'm sure the pain in his heart

147
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,010
is reflecting on
his countenance.

148
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,180
But there is no reason
for alarm.

149
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,080
What has to happen tomorrow

150
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,220
can happen tonight as well.

151
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,220
It seems that Pandavas' lives

152
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,020
are about to be eclipsed.

153
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,150
But how will that happen, uncle?

154
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,050
If we send word to Purochana

155
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,140
then grand uncle will also
come to know of it.

156
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,010
I never found Hastinapur's
traditional ways

157
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,140
of sending messages
to be proper.

158
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,050
The message should
reach discreetly.

159
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,020
Shukra!

160
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,070
My friend.

161
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,950
Will you take a message
to Varnavart?

162
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,970
You have to make haste
