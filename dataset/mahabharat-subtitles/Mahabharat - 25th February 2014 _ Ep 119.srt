1
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,800
Just give the Pandavas what
they ask for, Your Highness.

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,730
Heed my advice!

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,530
Give them what they want
even if it is in excess but

4
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,530
stop His Excellency Bhishma.

5
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,690
Make him the servant

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,630
of Hastinapur

7
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,530
so that in the future

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,530
going against
any of your decisions

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,690
would not be an option for him.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,530
All hail His Highness!

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,530
His Excellency
wishes to come in.

12
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,590
Your Highness.

13
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,690
Your Highness!

14
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,430
Greetings,
His Excellency.

15
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,460
I apologize,
uncle.

16
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,590
You may punish me
as you like. I...

17
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,690
I shall accept it, uncle.

18
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,460
Why are you sitting
on the floor, dear?

19
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,430
Sit on the throne.

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,590
The King of Hastinapur

21
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,460
sits on the floor
only during a 'yajna.'

22
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,490
I am no longer the King
of Hastinapur, uncle.

23
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,530
The right to be seated
on the throne...

24
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,460
I had lost it long ago.

25
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,460
You are the King

26
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,450
and will stay so
for a long time.

27
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,590
Now

28
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,520
according to Vidur's suggestion

29
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,330
the kingdom

30
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,590
needs to be divided.

31
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,560
And you need to give
the Pandavas half the kingdom.

32
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,590
Which part of the kingdom
will we get, uncle?

33
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,360
Is there any other city
in the Kuru kingdom

34
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,300
which we can make our capital?

35
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,420
I know that,
dear.

36
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,490
Believe me.

37
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,390
I have no intention
of being unjust to you.

38
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,450
However

39
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,470
we are being lenient
to Duryodhan.

40
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,290
Of that I am sure.

41
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,490
But my hands are tied.

42
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,360
What do you mean by that?

43
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,270
When one upholds justice
with no love in his heart

44
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,390
no righteousness

45
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,490
or happiness

46
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,260
but has just a fatigue

47
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,420
and the sole desire
to end further labour

48
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,520
and in order to placate a person

49
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,330
when he is rewarded

50
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,360
or given a present

51
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,290
instead of being punished

52
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,470
it is called leniency.

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,330
The truth is,
such a situation

54
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
is the defeat of
the one upholding justice.

55
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,420
It is his failure.

56
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,260
I have laboured enough,
Dhritarashtra.

57
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,430
Dear

58
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,290
to make sure the Kuru kingdom
always houses righteousness

59
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,490
I have struggled endlessly
my entire life

60
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,230
and taken to arms when needed.

61
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,270
I require rest now.

62
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,400
I...

63
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,430
I shall go away
with Yudhishthir.

64
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,460
You may stay here with your son

65
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,260
and rule the kingdom by walking
on the path of righteousness.

66
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,300
What!

67
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,300
You will go away,
uncle?

68
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,360
If you go away
with that Yudhishthir

69
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,330
then who will
protect my kingdom?

70
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,130
I am...

71
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,320
I am blind.

72
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,200
I...

73
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,260
I have no eyesight,
uncle.

74
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,290
How will I be able
to protect my kingdom?

75
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,300
Who will respect me,
uncle?

76
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,360
If I give Yudhishthir
half the kingdom

77
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,300
then the prosperity
of Hastinapur

78
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,200
will get halved,
uncle.

79
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,200
No...

80
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,130
No.

81
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,130
If you go away

82
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,390
then Hastinapur will be
robbed of its strength, uncle.

83
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,260
It will be robbed
of its strength...

84
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,260
Then what will I do
with such a kingdom, uncle?

85
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,150
I...

86
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,200
Like the roar of an old lion

87
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
my voice too

88
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,260
will get drowned,
uncle.

89
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,360
I will have no competence.

90
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,230
No one will be
afraid of me, uncle.

91
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,090
No one will be afraid...

92
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,300
You will have to give Yudhishthir
half the kingdom, Dhritarashtra.

93
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,160
Why should I,
uncle?

94
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,230
Why should I give him
half the kingdom, uncle?

95
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,120
If you go away with him,
he will have the competence.

96
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,030
But what will I be left with?

97
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,100
Weakness?

98
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,260
His prosperity will magnify
with each passing day, uncle

99
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,290
but mine?

100
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,130
Mine will decrease
with each passing day.

101
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,170
Then how will dividing
the kingdom benefit me?

102
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,230
It would truly be just, uncle

103
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,120
when even if he takes
prosperity from me

104
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,160
the strength...

105
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,230
The strength would
remain with me.

106
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,100
Or maybe

107
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,160
he could have the strength and...

108
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,160
And prosperity
would remain with me.

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,070
If he gets both then it would be
unjust to me, uncle.

110
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,160
Possibly, you may get
the lesser share

111
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,150
but

112
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,000
if doing so can avert a war
within the Kuru kingdom

113
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,090
and establish peace in it, dear

114
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,000
then you should accept it
whole-heartedly.

115
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,190
This is an earnest request
to all of you from me.

116
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,030
But which region,
uncle?

117
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,030
Is there no region
in the Kuru kingdom

118
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,030
where there is no city?

119
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,060
An uninhabitable place...

120
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,930
A place

121
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,160
which is terrorized
by ogres and monsters.

122
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,990
There is,
Panchali.

123
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,120
The name of that city

124
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,950
is Khandavprastha.*
*It was a forest region (Khandava Vana) on the banks of Yamuna river, in modern day Delhi territory.

125
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,130
Then we shall ask
for that region.

126
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,100
This way, at the time
of the division

127
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,890
there will be no struggle
within the family.

128
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,090
Forget about finding
a city in that region.

129
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,030
There is not even
a hut there, Panchali.

130
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,090
How will you live there?

131
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,960
I am certain you know
how to make a hut, My Lord.

132
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,090
That would be more than
sufficient for me.

133
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,000
Panchali is correct,
Nakul.

134
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,090
Creating something from scratch
is always more gratifying.

135
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,060
And brother Dhritarashtra
will give

136
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,920
that region to you quite easily.

137
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,990
But living there

138
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,000
will be exceedingly
difficult, Draupadi.

139
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
But living there

140
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,760
will be exceedingly
troublesome, dear.

141
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,790
Troubles?

142
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Difficulties give birth to glory

143
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,830
fame and prestige.

144
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,600
It is the mother to all three.

145
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,800
We shall ask for that region.

146
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,590
I have no region with me
which I can give to them

147
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,800
and yet preserve
the prosperity of Hastinapur.

148
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
If I have to protect my kingdom

149
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,530
then I shall require
prosperity, uncle.

150
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,760
And you have to admit it.

151
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,770
I assure you,
Dhritarashtra

152
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,800
that Hastinapur shall be

153
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,800
protected by Yudhishthir and me.

154
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,600
Whenever you need us

155
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,670
Yudhishthir and I
shall come to your aid.

156
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,530
And Yudhishthir

157
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,670
will never attack Hastinapur.

158
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,640
I believe that,
uncle.

159
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,710
But unfortunately, if such a
situation arises in the future

160
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,570
or my son does
something unrighteous

161
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,730
then you shall certainly
attack Hastinapur, uncle.

162
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,700
You know my son
quite well, uncle.

163
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,700
He knows what righteousness is
but can never act so.

164
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,710
Till date, you have stopped
his unrighteous acts.

165
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,600
In the future, you will
punish his misdeeds, uncle.

166
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,730
No, uncle.

167
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,440
I will never let that happen.

168
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,700
I will never let it happen...

169
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,470
That is why, I have
taken the decision, uncle

170
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,730
that I shall not declare
Yudhishthir King.

171
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,700
I shall not declare
Yudhishthir King...

172
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,560
I will challenge him
to a battle.

173
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,540
He will certainly slay me
in the battle, uncle.

174
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,640
He too is like my son.

175
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,500
I shall place my head on his lap

176
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,430
and bid adieu to this life.

177
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,400
Then I shall certainly
go to heaven, uncle.

178
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,430
I shall

179
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,470
certainly go to...

180
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,530
This decision of yours will
relieve uncle of a great burden.

181
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,590
Because of such benevolence

182
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,600
uncle has decided
to live with all of you.

183
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,410
That is our good fortune, uncle.

184
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,490
This is not only
your good fortune

185
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
but also that of uncle.

186
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,590
Do remember one thing.

187
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,540
Uncle has struggled
his entire life.

188
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,430
The number of sacrifices he has
made for the Kuru kingdom

189
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,600
cannot be achieved by a person

190
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,370
in a single lifetime.

191
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,390
Speak clearly,
Dhritarashtra.

192
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,340
What do you want?

193
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,400
All I want,
uncle

194
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,440
is for you to promise me

195
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,470
that under no circumstance

196
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,270
will you quit being on the side
of my sons and me.

197
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,310
Promise me this,
uncle.

198
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,570
Promise me this,
uncle.

199
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,460
Only then will I
divide the kingdom.

200
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,400
Promise me this,
uncle.

201
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,130
Grandsire has served the Kuru
kingdom his entire life, uncle.

202
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,130
Now, we five brothers

203
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,110
and our wife will be
at his service forever.

204
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,300
I have firm faith

205
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,000
that henceforth

206
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,240
grandsire will have to make
no more sacrifices, uncle.

207
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,100
Promise me, uncle.

208
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,040
Promise me.

209
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
You are asking me
for another sacrifice, dear.

210
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,200
So be it.

211
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,070
My father named me Bhishma.

212
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,170
In the name of righteousness

213
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,200
I can never tire out
in making sacrifices.

214
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,970
Today, I...

215
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,040
Today, I shall make
another sacrifice.

216
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,030
A container

217
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,200
can be emptied of its
contents only once.

218
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,100
But even after

219
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,010
one keeps drawing out
water from a well

220
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,170
it does not get emptied

221
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,980
because the water in the well

222
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,040
is obtained from
very deep within the earth.

223
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Dhritarashtra

224
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,940
I have to demonstrate
the depth of my soul today.

225
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,940
I have to prove that I can
make numerous sacrifices.

226
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,070
Hence, I promise you

227
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,070
that until you are
the King of Hastinapur

228
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,910
I shall serve you and Hastinapur
as its servant

229
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,940
and deem every word
of yours an order.
