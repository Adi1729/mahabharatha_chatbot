1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,040
Will we

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,200
be successful here,
uncle?

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,360
Certainly,
my darling.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,640
When compared
to the ties of blood

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,920
the ties of tears

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,280
are more tenacious.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,080
Use your tears

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
to tie

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,320
him.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Uncle

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
the last time we came here

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,800
we were gravely insulted!

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,080
How will coming here again
benefit us?

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,600
If the circumstances

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,320
you face

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,360
cannot be made
favourable for you

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,760
then you must

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,240
make them unfavourable

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
for the enemy.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
When the situation

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,280
of the enemy worsens

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
the resulting benefit

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
will come to us.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,440
But uncle,
how is that possible?

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Look

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,800
over there.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,240
All the strength
of the Aryan region

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,480
is on one side

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
and the might of those two men

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,200
is on the other.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
The side these Yadavas

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,960
take in the battle

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,960
will be stronger

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,480
than the other.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,800
Vasudev Krishna's affection

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,360
lies with the Pandavas and I

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
know that

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,640
but the mighty Balaram

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,080
deems you

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,920
his most favourite disciple.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
Getting Subhadra

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,280
married to you

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,360
was a dear wish of his.

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,760
Think of how we were
insulted back then

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
my darling

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,920
and shed tears for it

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
today.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,000
The mighty Balaram

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,520
will certainly agree

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
to take our side.

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,080
My darling

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,640
we must persuade Vasudev Krishna

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,160
to take our side as well.

54
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,720
Vasudev will never go against

55
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,640
his elder brother

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
and if Balaram

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,160
is on our side

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,160
then

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,360
even if the Pandavas

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,240
strive for their entire lives

61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,120
they will not be able

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
to have their revenge.

63
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,000
And that will

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,720
lead them to their death

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,240
and we

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,320
will not even
have to do anything.

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,360
Greetings, guru.

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
Bless you.

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
Beloved Duryodhan

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
the entire Aryan region
is talking about you.

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
However, it would have
pleased me more

72
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,960
had this talk

73
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
been about your prowess
in mace fighting.

74
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Greetings,
King of Gandhar.

75
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,000
Greetings, Balaram.

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,000
Welcome.

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
Vasudev.

78
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
Let's go.

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,960
You have given
my darling Duryodhan

80
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,800
a lot of things

81
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,080
mighty Balaram.

82
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,640
You gave him
the knowledge of warfare

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,240
gave him respect

84
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,600
gave him love

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,960
but

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,960
did not show him the path

87
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
to joy and contentment.

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
That is

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
precisely why we came

90
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,280
to Dwaraka.

91
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,600
Joy and contentment

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,200
are not places,
King of Gandhar

93
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
where one must go.

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,640
Both of them are paths.

95
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,000
The path of joy

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
leads to struggle

97
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,840
and that of contentment

98
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,920
to peace.

99
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,040
Where does the Crown Prince
wish to go?

100
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,440
What

101
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
is happening here,
Vasudev?

102
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,320
This is the Narayani* Army of Dwaraka, King of Gandhar.
*Narayani Sena was the Army of Krishna.

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,160
It is creating 

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
a labyrinth on the sea-shore

105
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
and at the moment

106
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,880
you are right in its center

107
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,440
as a captive.

108
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,120
But why,
Vasudev?

109
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,440
We came here

110
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
with the hope
to forge a friendship.

111
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,240
We are not here to fight.

112
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Is the friendship forged
during times of trouble

113
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,240
not stronger,
King of Gandhar?

114
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,480
But do not worry.

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,240
You do not need true friendship

116
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,880
because at the moment

117
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,960
there is no reason
for you to worry.

118
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,680
A boy of royal blood

119
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,840
is playing a game

120
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
to navigate
through this labyrinth.

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,560
A boy

122
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,600
is playing a game to navigate
through this labyrinth!

123
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
He is Arjun and Subhadra's

124
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
son,
King of Gandhar.

125
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
He was born with
the competence of Arjun.

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,560
Even at this age he can

127
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,280
navigate through the labyrinth
made by the Narayani Army

128
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,400
and reach the center.

129
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
His name

130
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,800
is Abhimanyu.

131
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Bless you!

132
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
Wonderful, dear.

133
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Wonderful!

134
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What?

135
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,200
Have you become
an accomplished warrior?

136
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,000
We have guests over.
Could you not restrain yourself

137
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,760
from displaying your skills
before them?

138
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,800
Our guests

139
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
were scared,
dear.

140
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Uncle, I was not
demonstrating my skills.

141
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,200
I just could not restrain myself
from displaying my competence.

142
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,600
And a display of competence

143
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
does not scare guests
but enemies.

144
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,000
Brother Duryodhan had navigated
into King Drupad's labyrinth.

145
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
If you can navigate
out from this one

146
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
then we will be scared.

147
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,600
My father is bound
to teach me that

148
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
but who will teach uncle?

149
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
Dear Abhimanyu

150
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,960
does your father have

151
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,680
no support of competent warriors

152
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,680
that a boy of your age

153
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,800
is being made to navigate
into a labyrinth?

154
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,880
I had imbibed this knowledge
when I was in the womb.

155
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,720
And coming to navigating
out of a labyrinth...

156
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,240
Before a battle,
all the weapons are sharpened

157
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,680
and I too am my father's weapon

158
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,640
uncle Duryodhan.

159
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,480
Beloved Duryodhan

160
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,600
it has been days

161
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,360
since I have had the opportunity

162
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,880
to have a mace fight
with an able warrior.

163
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
How about

164
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
we have a little
mace fight of our own?

165
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,920
Only then will we talk.

166
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,200
As you say,
guru.

167
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,280
Pick up your mace,
beloved disciple.

168
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,660
Vasudev

169
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,380
it seems as though

170
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,300
the mighty Balaram

171
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,060
does not deem this
a friendly duel.

172
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,940
The truth is,
my darling

173
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,220
is being beaten up by him.

174
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,940
Does one

175
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,820
not beat up and hurt another

176
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,300
in a friendly duel,
King of Gandhar?

177
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,540
The guru is punishing
his disciple.

178
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,420
The guru had taught his disciple

179
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,380
the art of mace fighting

180
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,620
but the disciple

181
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,100
deemed playing a game of dice
more appropriate.

182
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,700
The game of dice

183
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,860
has ended

184
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,340
thirteen years ago

185
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,100
Vasudev.

186
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,140
It had begun then.

187
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,180
Thirteen years ago

188
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,660
you had begun this game,
King of Gandhar.

189
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,980
And when a game is begun,
it is also vital to end it.

190
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,880
And when a game is begun,
it is also vital to end it.

191
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,680
When one team employs
a strategy in a game

192
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,040
the other team also has

193
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,240
the right to employ
its own strategy.

194
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,600
It is time now for the Pandavas
to employ their strategy

195
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,600
King of Gandhar.

196
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,760
Abhimanyu!
