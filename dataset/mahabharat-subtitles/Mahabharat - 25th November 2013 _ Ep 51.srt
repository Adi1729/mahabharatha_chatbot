1
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,080
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

2
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,880
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

3
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,050
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,780
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

5
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,820
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,010
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

7
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,810
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

8
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,040
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

9
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,850
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

10
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,880
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

11
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,840
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun...

12
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,820
Prince Arjun has bound
Prince Duryodhan with ice.

13
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,850
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

14
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,850
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

15
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,780
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

16
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,750
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,820
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

18
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Greetings, teacher!
- May you live long.

19
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,940
Arjun.
I am proud of you.

20
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,840
You are nonpareil.

21
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,810
The winner of today's
competition is undoubtedly you.

22
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,850
No other warrior has
the competence or adroitness

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,710
to defeat you.

24
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,940
Arjun is not only the most
superior among the Kuru Princes

25
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,720
but also no warrior in the world
can match up to him.

26
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,770
Subjects of Hastinapur!
My disciple

27
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,810
and your Prince Arjun

28
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,710
in reality, is truly
the best archer of the world.

29
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,850
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,780
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

31
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Arjun, release him
from this bond.

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,880
All hail...

33
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,920
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

34
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,680
All hail son of Pandu, Arjun!

35
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,770
Karna...

36
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,650
Who are you?

37
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
With whose permission did you
dare to shoot an arrow like so?

38
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,580
When one makes a sound
between two mountains, sire

39
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,720
the sound is bound to echo!

40
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,820
A mountain waits
for no one's permission!

41
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Sanjay.

42
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,580
What is happening here?
- Your Majesty

43
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,540
some archer has released
Prince Duryodhan from his bond.

44
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,550
Now, he is making
his way to the arena

45
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,770
maybe, to challenge Arjun.

46
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,520
Namely, we also have such
brave men among our subjects.

47
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,540
You are challenging Arjun, lad!

48
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,650
Do you not know

49
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,480
that this competition is
only between the Kuru Princes?

50
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,540
It was, sire.

51
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,610
And until this competition
was between the Kuru Princes

52
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,610
I was silent.

53
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,520
But upon seeing a few stunts by
Arjun, your excitement soared so

54
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,450
that you challenged
the entire world?

55
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,450
You declared Arjun
the world's best archer?

56
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,540
I too am a part
of the world, sire.

57
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,410
So, the dignity of millions
of archers of the world

58
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,540
and preserving it

59
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,550
is resting upon my shoulders.

60
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,380
That is why, you must either say

61
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,550
that Arjun is the best
only among the Kuru Princes

62
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,610
or order him

63
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,580
to accept my challenge and

64
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,640
add further glory
to your teachings.

65
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,580
Do you even have
a weapon in your hands

66
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,380
or just in your tongue?

67
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,520
Kripacharya,
this is a major crisis.

68
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,580
In the presence of
so many distinguished guests

69
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,640
the dynasty of Kuru
has been insulted.

70
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,380
To say that Arjun will win
might be an overstatement

71
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,420
but how can a Kuru Prince
accept a common man's challenge?

72
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,380
And if he loses

73
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,480
the Kuru kingdom will be forever
labelled a weak one, Vidur.

74
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,450
What are you pondering, sire?

75
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,470
Do you not have faith
in your disciple or

76
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,510
in your teaching?

77
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,180
What are you pondering, sire?

78
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,980
Do you not have faith
in your disciple or

79
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,140
in your teaching?

80
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,210
'I am Karna.'

81
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
'I seek to learn the art
of archery from you.'

82
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,090
'My father is the charioteer
of the great Bhishma.'

83
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,110
'I shall return
but let me assure you'

84
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,920
'that I shall return as the
most skilled archer of India.'

85
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,110
'And I will be superior
to all your disciples.'

86
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,980
I know you.

87
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Are you not the one

88
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,220
who had come to become
my disciple? - No, sire.

89
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,920
The one you had seen that day
had died the very instant

90
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,920
you had refused to accept him
as your disciple.

91
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,120
You were fortunate, lad!
You were fortunate.

92
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,060
Otherwise you would have
lost your right hand's thumb.

93
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,010
People choose different paths
in order to become great!

94
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,890
Some choose effort

95
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,110
and some choose deception.

96
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,150
Similarly, a warrior
engages in battle

97
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,890
while a murderer poisons people.

98
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,010
Is this not what you wish
to say uncle?

99
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,920
That is exactly
what I wish to say, Arjun.

100
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,080
That is what I wish to say.

101
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,110
To decline the challenge
is an insult to your teacher.

102
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,050
Accept it.
- I had accepted it the moment

103
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,980
it had been made to me.

104
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,820
Now, I only await
the competition to begin.

105
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,920
Stop, Prince!

106
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,050
Before the competition begins,
it is crucial to know

107
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,020
as to who the challenger is.

108
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,980
According to the norms
of religion and traditions

109
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,850
a king can fight only with
another king or a prince.

110
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,840
And a prince

111
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,850
can fight only with another
prince or a chief minister.

112
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,780
And a chief minister

113
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,050
can fight only with another
chief minister or a general.

114
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,850
In other words, a warrior

115
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,980
can challenge someone
equal to his rank

116
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,880
or a person who is of
a higher rank than him.

117
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,920
Who are you, lad?

118
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,010
You did not introduce yourself.

119
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,920
Before challenging anyone
to a fight

120
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,910
introduce yourself, lad.

121
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,820
Who are you?
You do not seem like a prince.

122
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,020
To which clan of Kshatriya
do you belong?

123
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,720
Do not ask him
that question, Kripacharya.

124
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,950
A warrior who bears such courage
does not deserve to be insulted.

125
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,880
Insult?

126
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,780
Telling about
my lineage and clan

127
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,980
is not insulting to me, sire.

128
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,750
I am

129
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,820
the great Bhishma's charioteer,

130
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,790
Adhirath Sushain's son.

131
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,740
Shudra!

132
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,840
So, you are the son
of a charioteer!

133
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,780
Despite being the son
of a charioteer

134
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,950
how did you even dare
to learn the art of weaponry?

135
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,740
Yes, I am a charioteer's son!

136
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,840
And I am proud of my father

137
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,750
who provided service to Bhishma
with complete devotion.

138
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,780
I am proud of my mother

139
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,780
who has fortified every inch
of me with her love.

140
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,880
Even today, because
of my mother Radha

141
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,740
when people call me Radheya

142
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,880
my heart becomes ecstatic.

143
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,780
I condemn every person

144
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,880
who is ashamed to be associated
with his parents' identity

145
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,670
and finds it an insult!

146
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,720
The son of a charioteer
cannot compete with a prince.

147
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,840
Why can he not?

148
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,810
How is my capability
related to my caste?

149
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,820
No one questions a waterfall
that cleaves through mountains

150
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,680
as to where its source is!

151
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,580
Its strength is its identity!

152
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,880
No one asks the lotus
that is offered to Lord Shiva

153
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,840
as to where it originated!

154
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,840
Its beauty is its clan!

155
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,680
Then why do you ask me?
Why?

156
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,420
No one asks the lotus
that is offered to Lord Shiva

157
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,280
as to where it originated.

158
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,450
Its beauty is its clan.

159
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,320
Then why do you ask me?
Why?

160
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,330
Pardon him, Kripacharya.

161
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,360
Let us go, son.

162
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,220
No, father.

163
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,290
Today, I must prove
my capabilities in this arena.

164
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,160
I am undoubtedly a better
archer than Prince Arjun.

165
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,360
Be quiet, Radhe!
And let us leave!

166
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,260
It is your father's order

167
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,400
that you will not
compete in this!

168
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,420
Go away, son of a charioteer!

169
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,260
Listen to your father

170
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,160
because he knows that your kind
has no capabilities!

171
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,190
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

172
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,130
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

173
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,390
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

174
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,320
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

175
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,320
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

176
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,320
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

177
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,190
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

178
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,160
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

179
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,120
Did I not tell you?

180
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,090
To make a place here
and to garner respect

181
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,260
are two things destiny
will never bless us with.

182
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Let us go, Karna.

183
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,230
Karna!

184
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,180
Let us go from here!

185
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,160
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

186
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,060
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

187
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,290
Go away, son of a charioteer!
Go away!

188
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,290
Son.

189
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,150
L-Let us go from here.

190
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,150
Let us go.

191
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,220
Stop, archer!

192
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,060
I wish to ask royal teacher
Kripacharya a question.

193
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,090
When Ravan, a Brahmin,
put forth a challenge

194
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,030
then why did Lord Ram,
a Kshatriya, accept it?

195
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,960
When challenged by a descendant
of the demon clan

196
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,900
why did our ancestor Dushyant
decide to fight him?

197
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,950
Because they both were kings.

198
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,990
It is tradition that...
- That

199
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,990
if this archer were to be
the king of a region

200
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,890
then he can challenge Arjun.

201
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,990
Then from this moment

202
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,900
this archer is a king.

203
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,120
I declare him king!
