1
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,380
Greetings, Minister.

2
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,410
Listen carefully.

3
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,330
Henceforth, you shall have
only one task.

4
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,230
You must monitor all activities
of the King of Anga, Karna

5
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,220
and inform the same to me.

6
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,420
Do remember.

7
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,430
Each sentence spoken
by the King of Anga, Karna

8
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,210
and every word uttered by him
should register in your mind

9
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,420
and you must
remember everything.

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,190
As you say.

11
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,350
Mother Radha.

12
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,410
Son.

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,320
Karna!

14
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,190
Son!

15
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,320
I

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,090
shall stay here tonight,
mother Radha.

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,250
I have forgotten the taste
of the food made by you.

18
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,280
I hope, you will
feed me yourself.

19
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,190
Son, you...

20
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,220
Why do you seem so agitated?

21
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,120
What is it, son?
T-Tell me, son!

22
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,250
Do not ask him anything, Radha.

23
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,260
Let him catch his breath first.

24
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,060
The major flaw of the
environment of a palace

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
is that it is serene
on the surface

26
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,220
but very soon, it ignites
a fire within one's heart.

27
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,290
An unrighteous person's heart
burns with the fire of desire

28
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,090
but that of a righteous person

29
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,250
burns with the fire of remorse.

30
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,250
Son! That place
is not right, son.

31
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,060
Please give up the greed
of being a King.

32
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,050
Come back, son.

33
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,180
Stay in your home with us.

34
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
That is not possible, mother.

35
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,120
I...

36
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,050
I cannot forsake my friend.

37
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,090
That is why, I had told you

38
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,190
that we would nourish this house
with righteousness, Radhe

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,020
because I knew

40
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,220
that you would have to be a part
of unrighteousness there.

41
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,990
If you befriend a serpent

42
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,220
it is bound to bite you.

43
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,960
Prince Duryodhan is not
a serpent, father!

44
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,020
Even he has met with injustice!

45
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,090
And even this is true

46
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,990
that resorting to righteousness

47
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,250
will not aid him
in having his right.

48
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,990
If you are certain
that Duryodhan's approach

49
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,050
is the only possible solution

50
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,030
then why are you
so unhappy, son?

51
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,150
Do not ask me that, father.

52
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,130
I have given my word
to Prince Duryodhan.

53
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,060
When the pillars of a temple
collapse, it causes no grief.

54
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,010
But when

55
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,190
the idol in the temple's
sanctuary breaks

56
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,920
it gives birth to
unrighteousness, father.

57
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,990
This is the fire
that burns me up.

58
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,130
Tell me how to put out
this fire, father.

59
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,930
Please tell me how to
put out this fire.

60
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,990
Charity.

61
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,110
Engage in charity, son

62
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,080
because charity is the
only form of meditation

63
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,110
that washes away all sins.

64
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,150
And also pray that

65
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,080
may Duryodhan's plan
never succeed

66
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,080
may your friend be saved
from committing sins

67
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,950
and may you be saved too.

68
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,860
Greetings, Crown Prince!
- Greetings.

69
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,830
Greetings, Her Highness!
- Bless you.

70
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,020
Do come in.

71
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,830
This place is outside the city
of Varnavrat, Purochan.

72
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,790
Indeed, Crown Prince.

73
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,920
I had the ambition of making
a grand palace for all of you.

74
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,890
And I could never have got
so much space within the city.

75
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,020
That is why, I had the palace
constructed here, Crown Prince.

76
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Where?
Beneath the earth?

77
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,790
Why are you jesting,
Prince Bheem?

78
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,890
It is right there.
Let me show you.

79
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Do come in, Her Highness.
Please enter.

80
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,100
Purochan, before we enter

81
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,170
we must light a lamp
at the entrance.

82
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,980
I-Indeed.
Certainly, Her Highness.

83
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,110
Do come in.

84
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,910
Do come in, Her Highness.
This way.

85
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,000
Do come in, Crown Prince.
This way.

86
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,040
Why bother, Her Highness?
Let me hold it.

87
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,040
Please enter.

88
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,840
This palace is miraculous,
Crown Prince.

89
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,940
My sons and I have
put a lot of labour

90
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,070
into constructing it.

91
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,840
We have poured all our knowledge

92
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,000
into building this palace.

93
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,830
Wonderful, Purochan.

94
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,030
Never have I seen
such a beautiful palace.

95
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,980
Does the entire palace get
illuminated with only moonlight?

96
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Indeed, Crown Prince.

97
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We have placed mirrors
in such a way here

98
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,740
that moonlight is
sufficient for lighting.

99
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,900
There is no need to light
even a single lamp.

100
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,900
Now, a more beautiful
structure than this

101
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,740
can be made only by Lord Vishwakarma.*
*Ultimate reality (later developed as Brahman), the "Principal Architect of the Universe".

102
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,830
Splendid!
Marvellous, Purochan.

103
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
Brother Yudhishthir

104
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,770
you should reward Purochan
for this lovely creation of his.

105
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,800
To have all of you reside
in the palace made by me

106
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,940
is more than a reward
to me, Prince Bheem.

107
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,770
On a new moon night

108
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,810
how does the palace
get illuminated?

109
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,480
On a new moon night

110
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,290
how does the palace
get illuminated?

111
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,420
A-Actually...

112
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,320
Actually...
- Sahadev

113
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,250
who is going to stay here
until the new moon?

114
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,250
Why do you worry unnecessarily?

115
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,260
Just think of how many mirrors
are present in this palace.

116
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,350
Nakul is going to be
very pleased.

117
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,250
Incidentally, the question
is a valid one, Purochan.

118
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,350
How does the palace get
illuminated on a new moon night?

119
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,250
We will have to
light torches then.

120
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,310
No, Crown Prince!

121
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,150
I will certainly think of a way
before the new moon night.

122
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,260
Brother, your room must
also be quite marvellous.

123
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Let's have a look.

124
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,240
I will be there.

125
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,290
Let's go, mother.

126
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,150
I forgot to tell Purochan as to
where to put that lamp.

127
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,070
What happened, Purochan?

128
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,810
Pardon me, Her Highness.

129
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,040
I dropped the lamp.

130
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,780
That is

131
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,780
an ill omen, Purochan.

132
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,980
The person who drops a lamp
meets with misfortune.

133
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,970
Now, light the lamp again
and place it near the entrance.

134
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,840
As you say, Her Highness.

135
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,940
He said that the cornerstone
of a temple is its pillars

136
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,810
and the sanctity of the temple

137
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,920
lies in the idol situated
in the temple's sanctuary.

138
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,850
When the pillars
of a temple collapse

139
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,010
it causes no grief.

140
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,810
But when the idol in the
temple's sanctuary breaks

141
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,910
it gives birth
to unrighteousness.

142
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,970
Pillars are the cornerstone
of a temple...

143
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,880
Which temple was the
King of Anga talking about?

144
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,850
I could not
understand that, Minister

145
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,970
but the King of Anga
seemed exceedingly unhappy.

146
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,880
As though he was
experiencing hell itself.

147
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,820
Duryodhan's enemies are
certainly the Pandavas

148
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,970
but why would the King of Anga

149
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,970
compare them to the
pillars of a temple?

150
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,780
When the idol in the
temple's sanctuary breaks...

151
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
He...

152
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,910
He...

153
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,870
He was talking about
the Pandavas'

154
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,910
mother, Her Highness?

155
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,680
Duryodhan must certainly be

156
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,680
planning to kill sister-in-law
and her sons in Varnavrat.

157
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,810
I must talk to uncle at once.
