1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,040
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,070
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,330
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,070
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,070
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,200
You better not leave, cowherd.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,200
My last sacrifice

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,030
will be you.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,160
Have faith in me,
Emperor.

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,100
I have not come here
to run away this time.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,160
Emperor, do you engage only
in verbal grappling-combat

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,000
or do you use
your limbs as well?

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,190
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,240
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,000
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,040
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,130
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,090
Why is this fool

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,260
not making the sacrifices

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,110
but engaging in a
grappling-combat instead?

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,070
Who is Jarasandha

22
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,030
fighting with?

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,000
He seems

24
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,130
quite familiar.

25
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,200
And those two
'Brahmins' as well.

26
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,200
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,940
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

28
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,010
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

29
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,070
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,060
That is Vasudev Krishna,
my darling.

31
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,070
I must stop Jarasandha.

32
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,900
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

33
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,010
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

34
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,900
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

35
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,010
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

36
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,000
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

37
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,840
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

38
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,900
So

39
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
is this the might
of the son of Pandu?

40
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,840
Had I known this before,
I would have sent my grandson

41
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,030
to engage in a
grappling-combat with you.

42
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,970
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

43
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,970
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

44
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,870
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

45
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,770
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

46
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,930
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

47
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,800
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

48
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,770
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

49
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,840
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

50
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

51
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,640
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

52
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,570
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

53
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,640
All hail Emperor Jarasandha!

54
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,950
All hail Vasudev Krishna!

55
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,120
All hail Prince Arjun!

56
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,930
All hail Prince Bheem!

57
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,120
All hail Vasudev Krishna!

58
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,950
All hail Prince Arjun!

59
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,830
All hail Prince Bheem!

60
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,830
Bless you.

61
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,000
Brother Yudhishthir,
the ogre Jara

62
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,860
had joined the two halves
of a body to create Jarasandha

63
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,050
but I have divided
that body into two again.

64
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,060
The earth has been relieved
of another burden, brother.

65
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,990
Jarasandha didn't stand a chance
against your might, Bheem.

66
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,920
Not only my might

67
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,860
but also my intelligence
is praiseworthy, brother.

68
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,830
Vasudev was playing
with twigs over there.

69
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,930
Upon seeing him,
it struck me

70
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,960
that if I throw
the halves of Jarasandha

71
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,760
in opposite directions

72
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,200
then he will not be able
to become whole again.

73
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,820
I know that it is a lie

74
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,900
but don't you dare try to
oppose my point, Vasudev.

75
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,820
No, brother Bheem.

76
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,790
How can a person
who slayed Jarasandha

77
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,930
ever be opposed by me?

78
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,050
You truly are intelligent!

79
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,020
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir.

80
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Bless you, Arjun.

81
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
The first obstacle
that stood in the way

82
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,950
of carrying out mother's order

83
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,860
has been removed
by the three of you.

84
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,950
To add to your joy

85
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,920
let me give you
a piece of news, My Lord.

86
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,960
Very soon, Subhadra will
give birth to your child.

87
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,750
Bless you.

88
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,960
Subhadra

89
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,920
just like his father,
your son will

90
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,760
also be a great warrior.

91
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,890
His fame will be immortalized

92
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,820
till the end of time.

93
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,920
When brother Yudhishthir
becomes King

94
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,830
his heir will be growing
inside Subhadra's womb.

95
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,790
It is not yet the time to be
thinking of an heir, brother.

96
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,730
It is time to take the second
step towards your independence.

97
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,890
The next step now is the Rajsuya
'Yajna,' brother Yudhishthir.

98
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Yes, Nakul.

99
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,760
I will go to Hastinapur soon

100
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,920
and seek grandsire's permission
for the Rajsuya 'Yajna.'

101
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,750
Pardon me,
brother Yudhishthir

102
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,690
but

103
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,830
independence can never be had
through someone's permission.

104
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,850
It is procured through
one's resolution.

105
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,660
The entire Aryan region

106
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,890
is afflicted
with unrighteousness.

107
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,630
The basis of a kingdom
is the happiness of the subjects

108
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,700
and not the prosperity
of the King

109
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:05,660
but majority of the Kings
are forgetting this key fact.

110
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,660
The task of making them
adhere to righteousness

111
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,640
can be done only by you,
King Yudhishthir.

112
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,630
We must conduct
the Rajsuya 'Yajna' soon.

113
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,660
We must make those Kings
adhere to righteousness

114
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
and the ones who refuse
to adhere to it

115
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,660
must be annihilated

116
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,890
otherwise there will
come a time, Your Highness

117
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,690
when, despite wanting
to adhere to righteousness

118
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,590
one will be unable to do so.

119
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,750
Everyone will

120
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,690
take to the path
of unrighteousness.

121
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Vrushali.

122
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,510
It was a question of the
Crown Prince's future, Vrushali.

123
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,530
Had I not accepted
this position again

124
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,540
forming an alliance
with Emperor Jarasandha

125
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,600
would have been impossible

126
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,610
and a crucial plan

127
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,530
would also have fallen through.

128
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,750
That is why, the Crown Prince
requested... - A plan?

129
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,770
Was the plan successful,
Radheya?

130
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,640
No, Vrushali.

131
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,640
Situations have changed now

132
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,570
but the moment I had decided
to become King again

133
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,700
I had only one duty to carry out

134
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,580
which was,
in order to help my friend

135
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,740
to be prepared to make

136
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,610
any sacrifice asked of me.

137
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,510
Is there any circumstance

138
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,670
that never changes?

139
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,650
During the darkness
of a solar eclipse

140
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,710
birds return to their nests

141
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,550
not because it is night

142
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,600
but because

143
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,510
they deem the day to be so

144
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,670
but night-time
follows eventually.

145
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,480
Bearing a crown on the head

146
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,670
does not bring about a change
in one's heart, Vrushali.

147
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,470
I am still the same.

148
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,470
This crown is my duty, Vrushali.

149
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,670
That is why, I am compelled
to bear its burden.

150
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,440
But I assure you,
Vrushali

151
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,670
that I will

152
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,510
never commit an incorrect deed.

153
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,540
Is your

154
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,470
will power your own, Radheya?

155
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,380
If you had that independence

156
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,440
then why would you have to
bear that crown again?
