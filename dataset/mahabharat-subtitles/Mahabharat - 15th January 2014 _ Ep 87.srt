1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,180
This is an illusory forest,
Nakul.

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,340
Illusory.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,310
Illusory?

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,370
Mother, the forest we are
in at the moment

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,250
belongs to ogres.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,310
Many years ago

7
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,180
grandsire had defeated
the ogre Hida.

8
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,080
And had instructed all the ogres
never to leave their forest.

9
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,170
And had also made a promise.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,220
'Henceforth, humans and ogres'

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,270
'will not trespass
on each other's territories.'

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,320
Since then the ogres turned this
forest into an illusory one.

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,250
Without the permission
of the King of the ogres

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,280
humans can enter this forest

15
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,080
but cannot find a way out.

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,080
And our teacher had
told us all about it.

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,110
Instead of paying attention to
your reflection in the 'gurukul'

18
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,200
had you paid attention
to teacher's lessons

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,150
you would not have
asked all these questions.

20
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,120
I was awaiting
your arrival, sister.

21
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,980
Draupadi, it is almost time
to worship Goddess Annapurna.

22
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,140
It is the tradition
of Panchal that

23
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,240
this veneration is the first
one in the life of a person

24
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,980
right after his birth.

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,140
And Dhrishtadyumna and you
have been born just recently.

26
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,950
Let's go.

27
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,110
Why are you smiling, Draupadi?

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,070
I was merely wondering

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,180
how, right after their birth

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,180
children take part
in this veneration.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,120
The child sits on its mother's
lap during the veneration.

32
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,140
And even an elder sister
is like one's mother.

33
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,070
So, will you perform the
veneration with me on your lap?

34
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,200
Me?

35
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,210
Onlookers will laugh at us.

36
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,040
Alright.

37
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,050
I will hold your hand
and sit next to you.

38
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,980
Pardon me, Draupadi

39
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,980
but I need to go
and command the army.

40
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,910
The handmaidens will
take you for the veneration.

41
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,950
This way.

42
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,020
Mother

43
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,070
why are you crying again?

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,870
These are tears of joy, Arjun.

45
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,970
Even in these difficult times

46
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,950
seeing all of you laugh

47
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,980
makes me so proud of my sons.

48
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,880
Difficult times?

49
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,970
Mother, time can
never be difficult.

50
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,950
When man forgets to smile

51
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,010
does time seem difficult.

52
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,040
You should rest now, mother.

53
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,850
Today, the five of us
will sleep outside.

54
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,810
How can you even
think of sleeping, Arjun?

55
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,940
We need to defeat
the King of the ogres

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,810
and find a way out of here.

57
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,780
Let's go!
- Bheem

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,950
we will not be able
to find them in here.

59
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
This is an illusory forest.

60
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,850
Illusory.

61
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,980
But we shall
certainly meet them.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,950
That is why, quit worrying
and rest now, brother Bheem.

63
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,900
I do not understand you.

64
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,920
These ogres are
man-eaters, Bheem.

65
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,810
In other words,
they devour us humans.

66
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,940
The way you always find
a way to your 'laddoos'

67
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,740
they are bound to find us.

68
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,710
We are their meal.

69
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,810
But you need not get
frightened, brother Bheem.

70
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,780
I shall protect you.

71
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,750
You?

72
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,780
You are so lean that you would
not make even a morsel of food.

73
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,850
You will not even
reach their stomachs.

74
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,940
How will you protect me?

75
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,920
That ogre is fated to die
at my hands, Nakul!

76
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,720
The biggest human of them all

77
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,810
will die at our hands first.

78
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,870
And the meat from his body

79
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,840
will feed us ogres

80
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,850
for a month.

81
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,810
Today, after so many years

82
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,680
we ogres will get to
consume human meat.

83
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,810
But brother

84
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,780
that human

85
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,840
seems quite strong.

86
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,680
What if

87
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,750
he defeats us instead?

88
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,770
Hidimba

89
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,670
you must use your
power of illusion somehow

90
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,670
and bring them to our village.

91
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,810
After that

92
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,810
they shall not be
able to face us ogres

93
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,740
for even a single moment.

94
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Do remember, Hidimba

95
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,580
that only those
enter this forest of mine

96
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,780
who are

97
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,670
never expected to return.

98
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,090
During my first veneration
will you

99
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
not be there with me, sister?

100
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,020
Father has announced
an attack on Drona's city.

101
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,920
And it is my duty
to command the army.

102
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,890
Draupadi, I am
the General of Panchal.

103
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,820
Are you the General, sister?

104
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,020
Yes, Draupadi.

105
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,980
I know that women are
not appointed as Generals

106
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,960
but grandsire Prishat
and father

107
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,060
have raised me
not like a daughter

108
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,790
but like a son.

109
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,030
To me, the greatest happiness

110
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,990
is commanding our army
as the General.

111
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,860
Do you know, Draupadi

112
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,850
that when I behead
the enemies of Panchal

113
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,090
I feel as though the ties of
my previous life are being cut.

114
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,760
I know, Draupadi

115
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,820
that neither is this tradition
nor the accepted norms.

116
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,790
I should be here with you
on such an occasion

117
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,990
but...
- No, sister.

118
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,890
I do not know about traditions

119
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,760
but when it comes to norms

120
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,990
severing the ties of one's
previous life is most apt.

121
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,930
I am proud of father

122
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,930
that he did not differentiate
between men and women.

123
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,850
By respecting your wishes

124
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,960
he appointed you as the General.

125
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,990
You should lead the army
to victory, sister.

126
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,950
You shall indeed be successful.

127
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,790
And when I see the look
of joy on your face then

128
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,860
I too shall be contented.

129
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,950
Army

130
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,990
for the arrival of
the King of Panchal

131
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,850
His Highness, Drupad

132
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,690
be Prepared!

133
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,760
All hail Mahadev!

134
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,850
All hail Mahadev!

135
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,910
All hail Mahadev!

136
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,720
Did you see, Malini?

137
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
In the entire kingdom, my sister

138
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,790
is the most powerful person
after the King.

139
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,820
Princess, the royal priest
awaits you for the veneration.

140
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,850
The veneration is
now complete, Princess.

141
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,660
You may now consume
the sacrament.

142
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,620
Dhrishtadyumna,
I was awaiting you.

143
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,780
Accepting the sacrament of the veneration of Goddess Annapurna*
*"The giver of food and nourishment", an avatar (form) of Parvati, the wife of Shiva.

144
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,790
is the tradition of Panchal.

145
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,620
Father had ordered me to do so.

146
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,660
Hence, I am here
to accept the sacrament.

147
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,780
We were born from the same
'yajna,' Dhrishtadyumna.

148
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,590
But the joy of life
that resides within me

149
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,560
is never visible

150
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,660
on your face, Dhrishtadyumna.

151
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,730
I have no time for joy.

152
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,750
I have been born

153
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,590
to behead guru Drona.

154
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,610
This is what the Gods
have predicted.

155
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,550
Thinking of anything else
is a crime to me.

156
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,620
Someone dying at your hands

157
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,620
is his fate

158
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,460
but to dedicate your entire
life for killing someone

159
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,650
dear brother

160
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,520
is your ill fortune.

161
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,450
You are a fool!

162
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,690
To give advice to men

163
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,650
is not the task of women.

164
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,660
What kind of an argument
is that, Dhrishtadyumna?

165
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,560
If father thought so

166
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,690
then why would he appoint
sister as the General?

167
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,690
Father has replaced Shikhandini

168
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,620
with me as the new General!

169
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,200
Father has replaced Shikhandini

170
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,160
with me as the new General!

171
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,230
Shikhandini gave father

172
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,100
mere defeat.

173
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,130
I shall give him victory.

174
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,260
He dismissed sister
as the General?

175
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,130
In front of the entire army.

176
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,130
And declared me the new General!

177
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,100
Why hurt sister in this manner?

178
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,170
She must have been dejected.

179
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,260
Think of father's hopes,
Draupadi

180
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,130
and not of someone's dejection.

181
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,090
'Who will achieve this task?!
You?!'

182
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,120
'You are a maiden, a woman'

183
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,100
'who accepted defeat
with the first blow.'

184
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
'I was a fool'

185
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,900
'to deem you the basis
of my strength!'

186
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,860
'You are of no use to me.'

187
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,990
'Until I get a son'

188
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,000
'I am childless!'

189
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,020
'A father never obtains
anything from his daughter.'

190
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,060
'I have got nothing
to do with a daughter!'
