1
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,390
'After 15 months.'

2
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,360
Greetings.

3
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,520
What message have you
brought, Ayurvati?

4
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,560
There are no signs of labour,
Your Highness.

5
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,560
How is that possible,
Ayurvati?

6
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,520
A woman should bear
a child in nine months.

7
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,420
And Gandhari has been
pregnant for 15 months now.

8
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,320
Why has she not gone
into labour yet?

9
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Disperse all!

10
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
Gandhari

11
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,420
you have been pregnant for
more than a year.

12
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,360
Then why haven't you
gone into labour yet?

13
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,490
Why has my son not taken
birth yet?

14
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
The one who had given you
the blessing of a 100 sons...

15
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,450
Ask of the same God!

16
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,260
Forget about 100 sons

17
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,290
my first son hasn't been
able to take birth yet!

18
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,260
Why?

19
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,330
I have been asking the same
question to Lord Shiva.

20
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,500
Like the future

21
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,260
even He is silent.
- That's the problem, Gandhari!

22
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Not the solution!

23
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,220
I am interested only
in the solution.

24
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,490
What do I do, my lord?

25
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,400
One can only wait for
the sun to rise

26
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,350
not try to make it happen.

27
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,460
In the same way

28
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,460
we have to wait for the
happiness fated...

29
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,330
I am not interested in these
lessons of yours.

30
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,230
I need a son.

31
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,320
I need my heir.

32
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,420
Find a solution to that.

33
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,400
Seek a solution to that!

34
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,360
Or I'll have to get a son from
another woman, Gandhari.

35
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,460
My lord...
- To bear a son for her husband

36
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,220
is the foremost responsibility
of a princess.

37
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,260
The reason I married you

38
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,420
is this boon.

39
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,420
And if you cannot bear a son

40
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,250
then this marriage is a
deception! A betrayal!

41
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,420
My heart now questions
me, Gandhari

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,160
if the Lord has even given
you any such boon.

43
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,330
Or in order to get
you married

44
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,320
your father spread this
false story.

45
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,420
Remember, Gandhari

46
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,420
if the wife cannot
bear a son

47
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
then the king does not feel
any affection for her.

48
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,390
Because to give the kingdom
its heir

49
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,250
is the duty of a king.

50
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,250
Hence, you can observe fasts,
perform rituals!

51
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,380
For this!

52
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,230
The penance that you had
gone through

53
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,290
in order to get this boon.

54
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,400
Go through a more strenuous
penance...

55
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,220
Your brother is secretly
overhearing us!

56
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,280
Let him know too

57
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,330
that between a king
and his wife

58
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
love can exist

59
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,330
only when that love
is linked to a progeny.

60
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,350
A child...

61
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,330
Lord!

62
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,350
There is a message from
Hastinapur.

63
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,200
Why does the minister
always send a riddle

64
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,290
instead of a message?

65
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,060
This is not a riddle.

66
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,290
To maintain the confidentiality

67
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,230
such language is used.

68
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,160
Lord, only you can
read his message.

69
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,130
Here it is.

70
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,060
What happened, Lord?

71
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Is it any troubling news?

72
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,020
What kind of a trouble
is this, Lord?

73
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,100
Did you give me a boon or
a curse to have 100 sons?

74
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,190
You gave me the lamp

75
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,200
then why don't You
give me the light?

76
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,060
If You have given me the path
then why not the pace?

77
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,220
What kind of kindness is this

78
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,990
which has become
the trouble to my happiness!

79
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,200
Lord, rid me of this pain.

80
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Help my husband
in quelling his unrest.

81
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,050
Until I deliver my husband's son

82
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,090
I'll keep meditating
in this temple, God.

83
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,090
I'll keep meditating.

84
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Lord, is it true that the love
between a king and a queen

85
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,830
is connected to their baby?

86
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,030
Why such a question, Kunti?

87
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
I am worried for
sister-in-law, Lord.

88
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,060
After a lot of difficulties,
she got brother-in-law's love.

89
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,890
What if... - You are getting
worried unnecessarily, Kunti.

90
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,830
A baby is the fruit of love.

91
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,900
Not the reason to fall in love.

92
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,940
I can't give you and Madri
any progeny

93
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,990
then has your
love reduced for me?

94
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,870
No, Lord.
Not even in my dreams.

95
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,940
Then don't worry
about sister-in-law.

96
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,930
This is an unfortunate time
for the whole Kuru lineage.

97
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,890
Even these times will
certainly pass away.

98
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,770
The shedding of the leaves is
not the end of the tree.

99
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,940
The spring certainly ushers
in new leaves, Kunti.

100
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,770
Kunti, God would have
certainly planned something

101
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,960
even for the Kuru lineage.

102
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,960
Lord, you are so patient
and tolerant.

103
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,800
Because the Kuru lineage
has witnessed

104
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,860
such unfortunate time
even before.

105
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,740
During the death of my father
Vichitravirya's

106
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,030
there was no successor.

107
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,900
Then grandsire
and Queen Mother

108
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,890
requested sage Vedvyas
for surrogacy.

109
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,870
What does that mean, Lord?

110
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

111
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,700
When a capable sage

112
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
without any selfishness

113
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,860
only for the welfare
of the people

114
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,740
helps a women to get a son

115
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,930
the process is called 'Niyoga'.

116
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,790
The baby that's born
in such a situation

117
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,000
is considered to be
her husband's baby.

118
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,960
That baby is pure as the babies
born by the power of mantras.

119
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,930
But if the husband is alive

120
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,700
then the scriptures
don't permit this method.

121
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,730
'I, sage Durvasa will
give you a mantra'

122
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,800
'by which you can call
upon any God'

123
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,920
'and by invoking that God'

124
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
'and can beget a son like
the same God.'

125
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,800
'The power of mantra
does not go in vain.'

126
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,890
'As soon as I disappear'

127
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,830
'a portion of my aura'

128
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,670
'will stay with you as a son.'

129
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,670
You have a son, Lord.

130
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,700
My son is your son

131
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,830
because he's born with
the power of mantras.

132
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,800
He is pure.

133
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,740
Lord, you would surely ask me

134
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,660
as to why didn't I
tell this to you before.

135
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,690
But, Lord, in my heart
I used to feel

136
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,830
that wishing for a son

137
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,740
and becoming a mother

138
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,700
would be my selfishness.

139
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,840
To suffer the curse
upon you

140
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,630
is my foremost responsibility.

141
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,730
That's why, I kept quiet.

142
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,740
Which fact, Kunti?

143
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,530
Lord

144
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,540
Sage Durvasa had blessed me

145
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
with a boon.

146
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,630
He had given me a mantra

147
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,700
by which I could
invoke any God

148
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,600
and be blessed with a son
of His characteristics.

149
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,760
Is that really so, Kunti?

150
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,690
Yes, Lord.

151
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,630
Without conception

152
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,560
I can beget a son.

153
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,660
And Lord

154
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,600
I... - You are a beholder of such
a great boon, Kunti.

155
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,600
I can't believe

156
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,570
on my good fortune!
On our good fortune!

157
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,500
You have a solution
to the problem of Hastinapur.

158
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,530
Through you,
the struggle of Kuru lineage

159
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,590
can be overcome forever, Kunti.

160
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,630
But, please...

161
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,530
Hear me out, Lord...
- I've heard you, Kunti.

162
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,590
The king and the Kuru lineage

163
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,600
will be gratified by you.
Beget such a son

164
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,470
who is a scholar
of righteousness

165
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,660
knowledgeable of justice

166
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,660
future of the Kuru kingdom

167
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,630
the one who can be enthroned as
a ruler next to my elder brother

168
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,440
and the one who can be the
fruit of our marriage, Kunti.

169
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,630
The one, whom the entire world
accepts as my son

170
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
which would enhance my respect
all over.

171
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,540
Invoke the God of righteousness,
Lord Yama

172
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,470
and seek his blessings
in the form of a son for me.

173
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,640
I'll enquire a saint,
about the auspicious moment

174
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,500
to beget a son
and be right back.

175
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,410
What is the prediction according
to the planets

176
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,540
Master Jaimini?

177
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,540
Why isn't Gandhari
going into labour?

178
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,580
According to the horoscope,
I can assure you

179
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,440
that it's time for Hastinapur

180
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,420
to be blessed shortly
with its heir, His Highness.

181
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,580
At this time, the position of
the planets is really propitious

182
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,450
and the son born will be
a follower of righteousness

183
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,480
intellectual and will be
a believer of justice.

184
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,420
On one side, you say that a son
will be born in our lineage soon

185
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,470
and on the other side,
you're not able to give a reason

186
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,540
of why Gandhari's
not going into labour.

187
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,380
If you are an astrologer,
then please tell me

188
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
the reason of this incidence.

189
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,610
My master Vedvyas often says

190
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,350
just like the way a horse runs
on his feet

191
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,350
but his speed and direction are
controlled by the horse rider

192
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,510
similarly, the direction
and movement of humans' lives

193
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,380
are controlled by the Almighty.

194
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,350
If the expecting child is not
born before 1 month and 12 days

195
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,410
then the child would
bear demonic traits.

196
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,340
He shall be aware of
righteousness

197
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,570
but shan't follow that.

198
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,540
He shall bring disgrace to the
throne of Hastinapur, Highness.

199
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,320
Disgrace to the throne
of Hastinapur!

200
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,370
Kunti

201
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,320
I have appeared, being pleased
with your invocation.

202
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,250
You have invoked me
by chanting this mantra

203
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,440
so you must be having a desire
of obtaining a child.

204
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,470
Not just a child, Lord.

205
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,310
I want a son instilled with Your
characteristics in him.

206
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,220
We want a son

207
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,510
who shall be determined
in righteousness

208
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,450
one who can be mentor
to the kingdom of Hastinapur

209
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,480
who can be a reason of gladness
for my ancestors.

210
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,410
You both are really noble
that you think of righteousness

211
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,270
even before any kind of worldly
power and riches.

212
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,250
Righteousness stems from
mercy which comes from justice

213
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,480
and justice from patience.

214
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,440
In all the battles, struggles
and movements of life

215
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,370
the one who is calm and composed

216
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,240
the one who doesn't care for
relationships and self-benefit

217
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,310
before taking a decision
for righteousness

218
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,320
can have righteousness
in his heart.

219
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,380
Your son shall definitely be
somebody of this capability.

220
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,180
My son!

221
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,310
My son!

222
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,180
Kunti, Kuru lineage will always
be obliged to you.

223
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,310
My son will symbolise
the God of righteousness.

224
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,150
He'll always be patient during
battles.

225
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,310
My son

226
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,180
will be called Yudishthir.*
*Steady in war.
