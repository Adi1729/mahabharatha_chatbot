1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
My beloved nephew!

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,210
The first stage of our plan
was successful.

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,130
Now, the desire of
leaving Hastinapur

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,170
and going to Varnavrat

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,230
will stem in the heart of Kunti.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,240
Uncle

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,070
how do you know that?

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,270
My dear!

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,200
My beloved nephew!

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,040
One who is familiar with
the nature of a female serpent

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,150
only he can play a been
and manipulate her.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,080
Purochan has gone to meet Kunti

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,080
to sow the seed of desire
to go to Varnavrat in her.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,130
Varnavrat is just wonderful,
Her Highness.

15
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,230
Just wonderful.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,100
The elephants there
seem like moving hills.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,030
This was when
you were not married.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,110
Prince Pandu
used to visit Varnavrat

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,140
to examine the elephants.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,170
And he was a beloved King
of us subjects.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,080
He was very benevolent
and affectionate towards us.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you remember, Purandiri?

23
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,980
I indeed remember, My Lord.

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,000
After he passed away, God seems
to have become angry with us.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,970
So, we wish to invite your sons
to the Varnavrat Shiv temple

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,100
to have them conduct
a veneration there.

27
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,030
We have taken this oath.

28
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,100
I have had
a beautiful palace constructed

29
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,130
for you and the Princes,
Her Highness.

30
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,870
And you will face
no inconvenience there.

31
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,070
I do not doubt your
architectural knowledge

32
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,870
but going to Varnavrat

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,030
and living there

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,000
is not possible, Purochan.

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,070
Yudhishthir has been crowned
the Prince just recently.

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,010
He has many responsibilities.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,700
As ordered by His Highness,
Bheem, Nakul and Sahadev

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,970
have gone out of the kingdom
to manage the border issues.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,870
And Arjun has gone to Dwaraka.

40
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,070
If my sons decide to go there

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,100
I will have you informed.

42
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,970
Your sons have made
the decision, mother.

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,010
We shall certainly move
to Varnavrat, Purochan.

44
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,930
Is that true, Crown Prince?

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,940
Indeed.

46
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,000
You are too kind, Crown Prince.

47
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,900
I am certain

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,870
that if you perform
a veneration in Varnavrat

49
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,010
the soul of the late King Pandu

50
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,000
will be contented.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,910
We are also certain
of that, Purochan.

52
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,930
On behalf of the kingdom,
the subjects of Varnavrat

53
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,000
will be given money as charity

54
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,910
by mother.

55
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,880
Have this news
announced as well.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,030
As you say, Crown Prince.

57
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,860
Now, allow us to leave.

58
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,870
Allow us to leave, Her Highness.

59
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,900
Why did you decide
to go to Varnavrat

60
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,810
all of a sudden, Yudhishthir?

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,870
Mother, be it a person
or situation

62
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,830
staying near them makes one
realize their demerits

63
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,800
while staying away,
makes one realize their merits.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,810
I wish to test the merits
and demerits of Hastinapur.

65
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,870
I am close to it now

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,810
but I wish to go away
for a while.

67
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,900
That way I will be able
to compare the two.

68
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Purochan.

69
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,670
Greetings, King of Gandhar.

70
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,940
What did that Kunti say?

71
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,930
Not Her Highness

72
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,670
but Crown Prince Yudhishthir

73
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,740
has given the answer,
King of Gandhar.

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,900
And very soon, they will
proceed to Varnavrat.

75
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,930
Splendid!

76
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,870
Absolutely marvellous!

77
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,800
Insects that fly often jump
into the fire themselves.

78
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,770
We merely have to start a fire.

79
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,900
This is called an ideal time.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,710
This plan is based

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,840
entirely on you, Purochan.

82
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,840
If you succeed,
your future generations

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,880
will never have to
engage in labour

84
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,610
for I will make you
a filthy rich man.

85
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,900
However, if you fail

86
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,740
then your future generations

87
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,910
won't be able to engage in
labour for they won't be born.

88
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,880
You need not worry,
King of Gandhar.

89
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,770
Things will go

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,840
as you have planned.

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,680
I have brought this vessel
for Prince Duryodhan.

92
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,670
Place it there.

93
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,800
Now, you need to go to Varnavrat

94
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,580
to welcome the Pandavas.

95
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,640
When the time is right,
my messenger will come

96
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,840
to you bearing the order
from me.

97
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,840
As you say, King of Gandhar.

98
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,730
Goodbye.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,670
Leave.

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Beloved Yudhishthir

101
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,770
were you not going to reconsider
going to Varnavrat?

102
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,700
Greetings, uncle.

103
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,730
I have meditated over it.

104
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,640
A veneration is
being held in Varnavrat

105
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,710
in father's memory.

106
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,580
I think, it is not only
important for us to go there

107
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,730
but also appropriate.
- But why?

108
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,700
When it is time to curtail
Duryodhan's unpleasant deeds

109
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,630
will your going away from
Hastinapur be appropriate?

110
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,730
If I stay here, everyday

111
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,700
Duryodhan will hatch
a new scheme.

112
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,700
Then what's the point,
Yudhishthir?

113
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,540
When you shall return

114
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,740
he will begin scheming again.

115
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,540
No, uncle.

116
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,710
If water is
contaminated with soil

117
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,470
stirring the water
does not purify it.

118
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,700
If given some time, the soil
settles down on its own.

119
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,610
I am absolutely certain

120
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,580
that Duryodhan's
agitated mind will

121
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,470
settle down with time.
- Just think about it.

122
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,440
Suddenly, after such a long time

123
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,670
why did subjects of Varnavrat
think of brother Pandu?

124
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,640
Before this, no veneration
was ever held in his memory.

125
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,480
Brother Pandu going to Varnavrat
in his lifetime

126
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,610
is also not something
I can recollect.

127
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,570
Do you not find this odd?

128
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,510
I have meditated over it, uncle.

129
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,670
If we do face any trouble
in Varnavrat

130
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,600
my brothers and I will be
able to handle it.

131
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,440
But in Hastinapur, our hearts
are always troubled, uncle.

132
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,470
One needs valour to battle
external troubles, uncle.

133
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,540
But a troubled heart
can be pacified

134
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,540
only by hardening it.

135
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,640
But acting heartlessly
with my cousins

136
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
is not something
I will be able to do.

137
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,540
'North-West, North,
North-East, East.'

138
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,540
'Dwaraka.'

139
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,430
Be careful.

140
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,270
Do not step on that.

141
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,270
'Do not step on
those illusory circles'

142
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,440
'else you will land
in the Netherworld.'

143
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,300
'You dance quite well.'

144
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,400
Did I not tell you?

145
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,240
Wait, let me come to you.

146
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,270
Be careful.

147
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,230
I have dug holes in the ground
and covered them with a carpet.

148
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,210
This exercise is done
to strengthen one's memory.

149
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,470
But, apart from
your brother Krishna

150
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,440
you will not believe anyone.

151
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,330
Do you still doubt
brother Krishna?

152
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,330
No.

153
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,370
I doubted him before I met him

154
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,170
but

155
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
now, I doubt myself.

156
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,330
So, what brings you here?

157
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,370
There is a message for you
from Hastinapur.

158
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,370
Where is Madhav?

159
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,340
I need to seek
his permission to leave.

160
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,210
So, are you going back
to Hastinapur?

161
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,210
No, not to Hastinapur.

162
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,240
Brother Yudhishthir has asked me
to proceed to Varnavrat at once.

163
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
But you hardly stayed
in Dwaraka.

164
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,240
The wise men of Dwaraka say

165
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,170
where there is Krishna,
there is Dwaraka.

166
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,180
And a friend resides
in the heart.

167
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,300
If you see it from this angle,
Dwaraka is right here.

168
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,300
So, what's the point
of staying in this Dwaraka?

169
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,270
I must follow brother
Yudhishthir's order and leave.

170
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,230
Allow me to leave.

171
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,470
It is time now, dear.

172
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,660
I have heard the news
that very soon Arjun

173
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,740
will reach Varnavrat.

174
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,700
In the palace of Varnavrat

175
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,470
the five enemies of ours

176
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,570
will assemble.

177
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,670
In that very palace

178
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,560
will be held the 'Yuvrajasuya Yajna' for you.
*Young (yuv) king imperial burning sacrifice.

179
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,540
'Yuvrajasuya Yajna?'

180
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,660
When a King
proves his competence

181
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,730
he conducts a 'Rajasuya Yajna,'
King of Anga.

182
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,600
Beloved Duryodhan

183
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,510
is about to prove his competence
as the Crown Prince.

184
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,470
Hence, he will conduct
a 'Yuvrajasuya Yajna.'

185
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,530
What do you mean?

186
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,540
In Varnavrat, Purochan has

187
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,400
constructed a palace

188
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,400
not with bricks, stones

189
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,470
and binding agent

190
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,660
but lac

191
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,560
cotton

192
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,530
animal flesh

193
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,440
clarified butter

194
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,470
and dried grass.

195
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,600
He has constructed it with
various inflammable items.

196
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,430
This is 'Lakshagraha!' 'Lakshagraha!'*
*House of lac.

197
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,470
This is 'Lakshagraha.'

198
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,260
A 'yajna' will be
conducted there. A 'yajna!'

199
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,200
And in that 'yajna'

200
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,360
that palace will be used
as the sacrifice, friend.

201
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,170
And my enemies

202
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,240
will burn to ashes
in that 'yajna!'
