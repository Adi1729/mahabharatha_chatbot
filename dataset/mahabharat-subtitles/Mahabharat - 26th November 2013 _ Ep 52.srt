1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,320
Then from this moment
this archer is a king.

2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,380
I declare him king!

3
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,350
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,510
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,310
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,440
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

7
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,470
No, Prince.

8
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,450
I do not covet a kingdom.

9
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,470
I have not come here to ask
for a kingdom in charity.

10
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,380
Respect shown towards my art
is sufficient for me.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,420
I do not wish for anything else.

12
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,370
The entire Kshatriya lineage

13
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,410
has been defamed by you, friend.

14
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,480
So, you ought to get
a chance to compete.

15
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,380
Far away in the west

16
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,450
there is a forested region
beyond Magadha.

17
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,280
That place
is called Ang Pradesh.

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,280
Grandfather Bhishma

19
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,250
had triumphed over
the people of that region.

20
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,510
But today,
it is devoid of a king.

21
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,350
I declare you
the King of Ang Pradesh.

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,370
How can this be?

23
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,240
No, Prince.

24
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,350
Do not indebt us
with such benevolence

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,310
that can crush all our lives.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,280
I have no intention
of being benevolent

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,470
Sushena.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,180
I consider all great warriors
to be my friends.

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,180
Prince Duryodhan!

30
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,370
Neither do you have
an authority over Hastinapur

31
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,410
nor Ang Pradesh.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,350
The truth is,
even a small amount

33
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,380
of land cannot be donated by
you for you have no authority!

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,350
You are correct

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,410
but his Highness
has that authority.

36
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,140
Maybe, his Highness
will fulfill his son's wish.

37
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,380
After all, it's about preserving
the honour of the Kuru dynasty

38
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,240
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,180
I, King of Kuru, Dhritarashtra

40
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,340
from this very moment,
declare this lad

41
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,110
the King of Ang Pradesh!

42
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,270
With my blood, I take the oath

43
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,310
that the charity made
by my father today

44
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,150
will be upheld by me
till the moment I die.

45
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,280
And I shall always defend it.

46
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,240
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!

47
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,180
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!

48
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,050
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!

49
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,170
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!

50
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,150
All hail King
of Ang Pradesh, Karna!

51
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Prince.

52
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,050
I honour the order
of His Highness

53
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,110
and with his blessings,
I take the oath

54
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,980
that henceforth

55
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,170
my property

56
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,140
my kingdom

57
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,980
my competence

58
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,110
and even my life

59
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,010
will forever be
at your service, Prince.

60
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,080
Your friendship
is sufficient for me.

61
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,950
Go on.

62
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,880
Fight.

63
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,050
Now, what are you looking at
your teacher for, son of Pandu?

64
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,910
Now, do you doubt
you being a Kshatriya?

65
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,000
Maybe he is

66
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,040
because everyone has heard

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,810
that the five of them

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,850
were not born with the blood
of our dynasty.

69
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,950
If Arjun is my son

70
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,780
he will certainly
accept this challenge.

71
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,980
Before letting his father's name
get defamed

72
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,910
he will accept death.

73
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,810
Sanjay!

74
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,810
Who got defeated?

75
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,710
The fight has not yet reached
a conclusion, your Majesty.

76
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,710
Only a few moments
are left until sundown.

77
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,650
The verdict must be in
before sundown!

78
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,270
'The power of the mantra
does not go in vain.'

79
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,460
'After I leave,
a fragment of my power'

80
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,220
'will stay back with you
in the form of a boy child.'

81
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,230
'My son will be invincible,
Kunti.'

82
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,390
'The entire world will know him
by the name of Karna!'

83
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,420
Princess...

84
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,390
Princess, he is...

85
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,420
What happened, Kunti?

86
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,320
T-That lad...

87
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,120
Princess... - Mother Kunti...
- Princess Kunti!

88
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,050
Mother Kunti fainted!

89
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,190
Princess...
Princess?

90
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,090
The competition has ended,
King of Ang Pradesh.

91
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,090
The sun has set.

92
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,000
It seems, you have
Lord Surya's grace upon you.

93
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,060
That is why the Sun God
upheld your honour.

94
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,060
Is darkness the limit
of your art, Prince?

95
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,790
No.

96
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,020
I cannot be unrighteous
in order to be victorious.

97
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,960
Resorting to unrighteousness
while proving one's superiority

98
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,800
is not art but arrogance.

99
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,090
But do not be disappointed,
King of Ang Pradesh.

100
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,050
You are a king now.

101
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,060
You will have more opportunities
to engage in fights.

102
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,820
Son.

103
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,850
Son...

104
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
'After I leave,
a fragment of my power'

105
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,850
'will stay back with you
in the form of a boy child.'

106
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,950
Karna!

107
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Princess... - Karna!
- Princess, calm down.

108
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,730
Calm down, Princess, and
do remember as to where you are.

109
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,760
My...

110
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,700
My...
He...

111
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,700
He... He is my son.
Karna!

112
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,850
My...

113
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,760
M-My son Karna.

114
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,730
Karna who?

115
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,800
I know only about the five sons
of yours, Princess.

116
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,750
What...

117
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,920
What are you saying?

118
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,890
I am telling the truth,
Princess.

119
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,760
Even the world knows only
about the five sons of yours

120
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,750
who are the sons of
the late Kuru King Pandu.

121
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,890
And you have no son.

122
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,760
What are you rambling on about?

123
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,760
He is my son.

124
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,760
He is the gift of
the Sun God himself.

125
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,690
Princess.

126
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,630
Only the feathers
attached to a peacock

127
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,800
act as its adornment.

128
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,730
The feathers that fall off it

129
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,820
act as a medium to dust
the seats of saints.

130
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,660
Do not talk like a fool,
Priyamvada.

131
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,650
A peacock feather may also act
as an adornment of a crown.

132
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,790
He is my son, Priyamvada.

133
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,850
He is deserving of the rights.

134
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,790
After so many years

135
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,590
he has come before me...

136
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,650
To have his mother's love.

137
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,690
To garner affection.

138
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,630
To...
To ask...

139
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,760
To ask for his right.

140
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,690
But Princess

141
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,700
he does not even know
that you are his mother.

142
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,690
Man must not feel sad for
something he could never have.

143
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,700
Think of the five sons of yours.

144
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,760
Think of their sorrow.

145
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,560
If the society finds out

146
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,650
that Karna was born to you
out of a wedlock

147
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,600
there will be no appreciation
in his respect.

148
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,560
But the five sons of yours
will certainly be ridiculed.
