1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,520
If grandsire continues
battling in this manner

2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,160
then he will annihilate
our entire army.

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,430
Tomorrow, I shall challenge
grandsire to a duel.

4
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,530
And Guru Dronacharya
is fated to die

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,250
at the hands of
General Dhrishtadyumna.

6
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,680
Tomorrow,
at any cost

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,920
you must retaliate
against Guru Dronacharya.

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,490
Retaliating against Guru Drona

9
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,730
by himself is impossible
for General Dhrishtadyumna.

10
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,530
Arjun should help him.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,400
Stopping Guru Drona by oneself

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,840
will not be easy for anyone.

13
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,620
If brother Arjun

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,340
will battle Guru Drona

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,850
then who will retaliate
against grandsire?

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,420
Just like a 'vajra'

17
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,390
he will annihilate
our entire army.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,840
There is only one way out.

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,200
It is mandatory
to keep His Excellency

20
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,680
away from the battlefield.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,780
And if

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,590
His Excellency will be
away from the battlefield

23
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,250
and at that very moment

24
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,720
Guru Drona

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,420
will be battling Arjun

26
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,560
then Duryodhan

27
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,270
will have no one to protect him.

28
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,270
But Madhav

29
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,960
is it even possible
to keep grandsire

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,610
away from the battlefield?

31
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Using treachery.

32
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,450
Yes, friend.

33
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,490
I had said

34
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,130
that treachery will indeed
be employed in this war

35
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,130
and it is time now to employ it.

36
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,130
Treachery?

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,710
But resorting to treachery in
a war is unrighteous, Vasudev.

38
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,180
Even this war is a result of
treachery, brother Yudhishthir.

39
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,460
And if the basis of treachery
is righteousness

40
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,820
then employing treachery
is righteous as well.

41
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,560
And in order to boost
the morale of our army

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,390
it is mandatory for us
to gain victory tomorrow.

43
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,140
And in order to gain victory

44
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,910
we shall be required to take
only five steps.

45
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,120
Only five steps.

46
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,240
'Second Day of the War.'

47
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,780
After yesterday's defeat

48
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,340
what strategy have
the sons of Pandu

49
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,110
come up with today,
Sanjay?

50
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,650
Are they trembling with fear

51
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,420
at the very thought of defeat?

52
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,320
Today, the sons of Pandu
have kept Prince Yudhishthir

53
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,490
at the end of their
battle formation, Your Highness.

54
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,760
'In order to protect him,
General Dhrishtadyumna'

55
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,870
'King Virat and the Upapandavas
are present, Your Highness.'

56
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,300
'The ones leading
the battle formation'

57
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,270
'are Prince Nakul,
Prince Sahadev'

58
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,930
'and Prince Abhimanyu,
Your Highness.'

59
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,440
'On one side of the formation,
there is Prince Arjun'

60
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,640
'while on the other, there is
Prince Bheem, Your Highness.'

61
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,620
But what kind
of a battle formation

62
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,780
have the sons of Pandu
come up with, Sanjay

63
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,490
where Yudhishthir
is right at the end?

64
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,190
Such kind of a formation

65
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,860
is aggressive in nature,
Your Highness.

66
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,160
It can cut right through

67
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,830
the enemy army, Your Highness.

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,910
And its sides

69
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,270
can leave the enemy army in
total disarray, Your Highness.

70
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,250
The 'Krouncha Vyooh.'*
*Crane-shaped formation.

71
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,180
This battle formation
of the Pandavas

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,150
is advancing towards
the army of the Kauravas

73
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,190
Your Highness.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,700
But what formation has
grandsire come up with

75
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,700
in retaliation to this one,
Sanjay?!

76
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Assume the form of a 'Maha Vyooh!'*
*To block the outflanking move of the enemy.

77
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,420
Crown Prince Duryodhan

78
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,860
shall stay under my protection

79
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,820
in the middle of the formation!

80
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,620
Guru Drona

81
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,230
shall lead us

82
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,910
and protect us from any attack
launched against us!

83
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,380
Dusshasan

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,770
Ashwatthama,
King of Gandhar

85
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,540
King Shalya

86
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,620
and King Susharma, attack the
sides of the enemy formation!

87
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,720
The 'Krouncha Vyooh'
can be broken

88
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,220
by stifling the neck of this
bird-shaped formation.

89
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,530
Attack!
- Attack!

90
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,170
Attack!

91
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,200
Attack! - All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!

92
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,650
All hail Mahadev!

93
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,730
King of Madra!

94
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,070
Do not mourn the death
of Crown Prince Uttar

95
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,430
because he shall
always live in my weapons!

96
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,680
Prince Arjun!
The army of Trigartha

97
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,920
has been assembled
only to battle you!

98
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,320
These soldiers have
only one goal in their lives

99
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,690
and that is to slay you!

100
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,460
Neither does another warrior
have the competence to kill them

101
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,300
nor do they have the intention
of striking at another warrior!

102
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,570
Do not employ words
to attack me, King Susharma!

103
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,770
Resort to weapons instead!

104
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,900
Friend

105
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,230
it is time to take
the first step to our victory.

106
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,040
That is the sign from Arjun.

107
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,850
The garland of victory
shall await you, dear!

108
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,350
Leave at once!

109
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,490
Charioteer.

110
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Today, you shall get the answer
to yesterday's treachery

111
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,060
King of Madra!

112
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,900
Do you hear that?!

113
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,200
The entire battlefield
is resonating with that answer!

114
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,160
Steer the chariot to the middle
of our formation, charioteer.

115
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,560
One must not battle where
there is mist.

116
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
Steer the chariot at once!

117
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,770
What else is happening
in the battlefield, Sanjay?!

118
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,710
Why are you not telling
me anything?!

119
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,140
Nothing is visible in the
battlefield, Your Highness.

120
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,020
The battle formation
of the Pandavas

121
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,350
has been completely
hidden by clouds.

122
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,260
The miraculous weapon
of Prince Arjun

123
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,690
has left the entire battlefield
confounded, Your Highness.

124
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,070
Where is Arjun, Sanjay?
Where is Arjun?!

125
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,880
It is time to take
the second step to our victory.

126
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,710
His Excellency and Guru Drona

127
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,820
need to be separated from
Crown Prince Duryodhan.

128
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,960
Brother Yudhishthir,
are you prepared?

129
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,260
No, Vasudev.

130
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,770
I cannot bring myself
to do this.

131
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,970
I had told you,
brother Yudhishthir

132
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,670
that His Excellency's
ties and his weakness

133
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,810
lie in the fort of Hastinapur.

134
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,820
If you attack Hastinapur

135
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,090
then His Excellency
will leave the battlefield

136
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,720
trailing you.

137
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,460
But we had decided
that the war will be fought

138
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,230
only on this battlefield.

139
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,900
This region of Samanta Panchaka
lies amidst five lakes.

140
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,970
Those five lakes are
the boundaries of this region.

141
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,970
We cannot battle beyond
these confines.

142
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,810
No, Vasudev.

143
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,150
Leaving the battlefield
is not appropriate.

144
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,160
Leaving the battlefield is also
a kind of battle formation

145
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,660
brother Yudhishthir.

146
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,820
Think of it as
a kind of battle formation.

147
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,080
Charioteer
take the chariot forth.

148
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,690
'Along with one 'akshauhini'
army, Prince Yudhishthir'

149
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,350
'is exiting
their battle formation'

150
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,920
'and advancing towards
Hastinapur, Your Highness.'

151
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,200
Yudhishthir is advancing
towards Hastinapur!

152
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,830
It is time to take
the third step to our victory.

153
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,130
Brother Bheem

154
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,030
brother Yudhishthir
is going to attack Hastinapur.

155
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,950
Would you not like to deliver
this news to Dusshasan?

156
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,380
Certainly, Vasudev.

157
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,780
My mace shall deliver
the message to that fool!

158
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,990
Sanjay...

159
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,470
Sanjay, what else is happening
in the battlefield?

160
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,240
How...
How can Yudhishthir

161
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,770
leave the battlefield and
attack Hastinapur?

162
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,880
Out of the greed for victory

163
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,290
righteousness keeps getting
sacrificed, Your Highness.

164
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,020
Possibly, the defeat
of the first day

165
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,790
has replaced righteousness
with victory within them

166
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,850
Your Highness.

167
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,440
Sanjay, where is Bheem?

168
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,260
Pick up the mace,
Dusshasan

169
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,870
and remind me once again
about the strength of your arms.

170
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,510
What if I forget about
their strength

171
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,310
while ripping your arms out.

172
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,510
Get up!

173
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,500
King Virat, go and help
brother Yudhishthir out

174
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,460
by proceeding
towards Hastinapur!

175
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,960
In order to help Dusshasan out

176
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,360
I shall stay right here.

177
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,610
Brother Duryodhan!

178
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,340
A very large section
of the enemy army

179
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,750
is headed towards Hastinapur,
brother Duryodhan!

180
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,420
Brother Yudhishthir is leading
that army, brother Duryodhan!

181
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,400
He is headed towards Hastinapur
to indeed attack it, my darling.

182
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,330
Then grandsire will
have to trail

183
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,800
Yudhishthir at the earliest.

184
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,930
In order to protect Hastinapur...

185
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,030
But battling outside the borders
of Samanta Panchaka

186
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,570
is unrighteous!

187
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,450
And brother Yudhishthir
can never act unrighteously.

188
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,410
If you keep pulling the tail
of a cow, my darling

189
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,180
then it too can charge at you.

190
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,290
If he gets
the slightest hint of defeat

191
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,660
then even Yudhishthir
can resort to unrighteousness.

192
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,990
Impossible!

193
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,800
I have firm belief
in Yudhishthir!

194
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,270
He can never act unrighteously!

195
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,870
Your Excellency

196
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,830
belief gives one great comfort

197
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,350
but in the battlefield

198
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,740
disbelief provides one
with great benefits

199
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,690
while belief results
only in losses.

200
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,410
Uncle is correct, grandsire.

201
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,220
Can we gamble in such
a situation?

202
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,690
If your belief
turns out to be false

203
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,030
and Yudhishthir goes
to Hastinapur and slays the King

204
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,600
then what will you do?

205
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,840
I order you, grandsire
to trail Yudhishthir.

206
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,440
Then who will protect you here?

207
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,600
In order to protect
my darling Duryodhan

208
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,450
numerous Maharathis
are present here

209
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,950
Your Excellency Bhishma.

210
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,450
However

211
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,360
over there

212
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,590
Yudhishthir is by himself

213
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,470
and you can slay him

214
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,770
in such a situation.

215
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,270
I order you, grandsire

216
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,340
to trail Yudhishthir

217
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,680
and protect Hastinapur

218
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,920
and the moment
you get the opportunity

219
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,450
you need to slay him.
