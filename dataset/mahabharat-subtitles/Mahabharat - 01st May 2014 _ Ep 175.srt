1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,640
Were you aware that all this
was happening in Dwarka?

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,440
Yes, brother!

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
This has been happening
since a while.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
I tried stopping it.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,560
But the subjects of Dwarka

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,040
get drawn to the path
of immorality repeatedly.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
When a river meets a waterfall

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
it's speed grows even further.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,920
Even when the society
treads the path of immorality

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,880
it gets completely tainted
with injustice.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Yudishtir is the one to be
blamed for all of this.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,920
He gambled his own wife
in that filled courtroom.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,200
And now, all over the Arya clan

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
people are following
that despicable practice.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
No, elder brother!

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
No!

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,600
Neither is brother Yudishtir
to be blamed

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,600
nor brother Duryodhan.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
It is the righteousness
that is to blame

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,200
that gets bound by malice...

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,760
That surrenders before malice...

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,640
In reality, it is the blindness
of traditions.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,200
There is no such thing
as righteousness.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,600
Please elaborate, brother.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,080
When a man holds on stubbornly
to his oaths and promises

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
it is great indeed,
elder brother.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,960
But is being stubborn
in every situation

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
any wise?

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
The same happened
in that filled courtroom.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
Grandsire Bheeshma,
Master Drona

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,680
Vidur, the wise one,
and the eldest brother Yudishtir

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
were all bound by their words

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,160
and remained blinded
by tradition.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,280
Just fulfilling their oaths
and promises

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,360
seemed like righteousness
to them.

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,400
Even if one of them had
broken out of their solemnity

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Draupadi would never face
such grave injustice.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,880
What do you mean to say,
Krishna?

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
Isn't fulfilling of oaths
appropriate?

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,920
Righteousness is like a tree,
elder brother.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Oaths and promises
are its branches.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,120
But the roots of the tree are

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
compassion.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
The branches are
significant too.

45
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,320
But not as much as the roots.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,400
If in order to end one's agony
a promise has to be broken

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,120
it is appropriate.

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,240
But here, at this present time

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
compassion has been destroyed
all across the Arya clan.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
All across the world!

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
One values his agony
more than that his dear ones.

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
And the agony of dear ones
matters more than society's...

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
Compassion has drained out
of this society.

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,640
When there is no compassion
in the society

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
people do not bond
with each other, elder brother.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,920
They just live for
their own comfort.

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,800
The plight that Dwarka
is in today

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,080
is the plight of
all of Arya clan.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
The branches of trees
that snap off the trunk

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
dry up and become wood.

61
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,760
Similarly, at this time,
righteousness

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,960
has grown lifeless.

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,200
It is time to revive
righteousness, elder brother!

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,480
Once again the society must be

65
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,200
made aware of righteousness.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Our administration will handle

67
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,960
the injustice prevailing
in Dwarka, Krishna.

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,000
But I am facing
another grave problem.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
That is due to the injustice
prevailing in the Arya clan.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,680
The prospective war between
the Kauravas and Pandavas.

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
There shall indeed be a war,
elder brother!

72
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
When compassion is destroyed
within a society

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,320
the society itself
decides a war for itself.

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,480
The Kauravas and Pandavas

75
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
are mere clans.

76
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,720
A river has banks.

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,040
But a flood has no banks.

78
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,280
Even we cannot be mere
spectators in this war, brother.

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,120
We have to fight
on someone's behalf.

80
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,200
You are right, Krishna.

81
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
But brother, an equally
important truth is

82
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,600
the side to which
you shall incline to

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800
will turn into the just side
by default, Krishna.

84
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,200
Now try proving me false.

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,600
What are you doing, son?

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,280
Whose heads are you smashing?

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
That head was supposed
to be yours.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,720
Dear son, Abhimanyu.

89
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,080
If you severe my head

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
your uncle Bheem shall be angry.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,080
Because the oath to slay
all of us hundred brothers

92
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,600
is your uncle Bheem's.

93
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,920
And you father wants

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
to slay the armoured Karna.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Then I shall slay your sons,
uncle!

96
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Whoever the blood of
Grandsire Dhritarashtra runs in

97
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,680
shall bleed it all out
on the battlefield!

98
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,120
Son Abhimanyu, there are
two more heads

99
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,400
that you can severe.

100
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,120
Your uncle Krishna
and uncle Balram.

101
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
Because your uncle

102
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
has chosen our side.

103
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,120
Will you be able to
severe his head?

104
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,840
If an earthen pot has
held poison even once

105
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,440
it has to be smashed,
uncle Duryodhan.

106
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
Couldn't you severe the heads?

107
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,400
Because the heads of
both my uncles

108
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
can never nurse the thought of
siding with injustice.

109
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,080
Brilliant!

110
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
Brilliant indeed, Son Abhimanyu!

111
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,160
You have indeed understood
both your uncles well.

112
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
Come.

113
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,640
It is time now for you
to train for mace combat.

114
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,960
Proceed and wait for me.

115
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Bless you!

116
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Forgive me, Balram,
the mighty one!

117
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,360
But you have promised that...
- That...

118
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,240
I shall not fight
on behalf of the Pandavas.

119
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,440
But neither had I assured you,
King of Gandhar

120
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,920
that I would fight
on behalf of the Kauravas.

121
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,960
So how did you arrive
at this conclusion?

122
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,640
I shall not fight on
anyone's side in this battle.

123
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,160
I shall not fight on
anyone's side in this battle.

124
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,520
Because after all,
both sides are my family.

125
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,000
And how can I engage
my own family in battle?

126
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,280
Therefore, will Krishna

127
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,160
and his army not participate in
this war either, Master Balram?

128
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,280
You better question him
regarding that decision.

129
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,360
Krishna is Lord Narayana.*
*The Refuge of Everyone.

130
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
And all decisions pertaining to
the army of Narayana

131
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,680
will be made by Himself.

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Dear Duryodhan,
go and counsel with Krishna.

133
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,440
He has promised me
that he won't be partial.

134
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,200
Whoever approaches him first

135
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,600
he will provide that person
with appropriate help.

136
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,400
But remember.

137
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Victory lies to the side
that Krishna will be on.

138
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,800
Permit me!

139
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,840
My lad, go and meet Krishna
immediately.

140
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,440
Meet him before Arjun does.

141
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
Remember.

142
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Under any circumstances,
Krishna, the son of Vasudev

143
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,200
should be on our side.

144
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,320
And also the army
of Lord Narayana.

145
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,040
Meet him at the earliest.

146
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,280
Make haste, my lad!
Make haste!

147
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,880
My Lord!

148
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
My Lord!

149
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,080
The eldest one has
sent a message.

150
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,200
He has consented with
Lord Krishna and the Yadav army

151
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,120
with participating
in the battle.

152
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,200
Hurry up, My Lord!

153
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Request brother Krishna

154
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,600
to aid our side with the army
of Lord Narayana.

155
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,160
Krishna has always been

156
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,840
on the side of
truth and justice.

157
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,280
If there is no truthfulness
on our side

158
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,800
there is no use asking him.

159
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,560
You have to ask him, My Lord!

160
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,440
Help is granted without asking.

161
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,400
But blessings...

162
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,040
Blessings must be sought.

163
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,520
And if brother supports you
without asking

164
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,640
brother Duryodhan will claim

165
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
that Krishna is being partial.

166
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,960
Krishna has promised

167
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,120
that whoever
approaches him first

168
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,520
he shall surely grant him

169
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
whatever he asks for.

170
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
Please go soon, My Lord.

171
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,720
You must approach Krishna before
the son of Dhritarashtra does.

172
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,080
Please go soon!

173
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Arjun, why are you
seated on the ground?

174
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,920
A beseecher's place
lies on the ground, Krishna.

175
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,640
You aren't a beseecher, Arjun,
you are my friend.

176
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,240
If I am a friend
how does my position matter?

177
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,480
Even prince Duryodhan
awaits your counsel.

178
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Welcome brother Duryodhan!

179
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,240
I did not spot you
as you were seated above.

180
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,480
Excuse me!

181
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,640
Krishna.

182
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,000
I am not seated higher.

183
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
I am seated next to you.

184
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,800
Very well!

185
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,080
Would you like some
refreshments?

186
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,760
The 'ksheer pak'* made from the milk of Dwarka's cows.
*A milk decoction.

187
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,600
You shall not find it even in
the celestial world.

188
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,200
My gratitude, Krishna!

189
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,280
I am not here for refreshments.

190
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,120
I am here to discuss

191
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,800
an important matter.

192
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,640
We shall indeed discuss,
brother Duryodhan.

193
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,920
First, let me hear
Arjun's request.

194
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,440
Go ahead, Arjun.

195
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
But, Krishna.

196
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,640
You had promised master Balram

197
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,800
that whoever approaches you
first

198
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,360
you shall join his side.

199
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,600
Impossible.

200
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,600
Brother could never decipher
this meaning from my words.

201
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,920
I had said

202
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,120
whoever appears before me first

203
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,360
I shall surely grant his wish.

204
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,640
You speak first, Arjun.
