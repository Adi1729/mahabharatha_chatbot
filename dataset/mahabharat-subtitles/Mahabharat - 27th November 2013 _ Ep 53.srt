1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,160
If the society learns

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,930
that you bore Karna before
you got married

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,200
no one would respect him.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,170
But instead your five sons
would be mocked at.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,060
I do not wish to consider that!

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,100
I do not care for anyone!

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,030
When he'd have cried as a child

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
which mother would have
wiped his tears!

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,030
I have to wipe the stains
of all his old tears.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,910
I want to run my hands
through my Karna's hair

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,130
and pacify him.

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,970
Beyond a mother's lap

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,940
there exists no childhood,
Priyamvada.

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,070
None at all.

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,060
Mother, childhood doesn't exist
beyond a mother's lap.

16
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,870
There exists no life.

17
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,870
Even after I get crowned

18
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,930
you'd let me rest my head
in your lap, right?

19
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,970
Dear, you must remove the crown
and place your head on my lap

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,840
or it will prick me.

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,060
Mother

22
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,970
aren't you happy
about my coronation ceremony?

23
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,040
A person's happiness

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
is as per his capability.

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,010
The coronation, the palace

26
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,870
are beyond me.

27
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,870
The only thing I am happy about

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,970
that after several years

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,830
the visage of my son radiates

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,070
satisfaction and pride.

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,830
Radha, take a long look
at this radiance.

32
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,840
It will be soon surrounded by
the dark clouds of regret.

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,000
People would say that
the greed to attain pride

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,870
provided a lifelong slur
to Karna.

35
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,000
I didn't understand, father.

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,940
A gem lying in the coals

37
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,970
is considered as coal, son.

38
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,010
By befriending
King Dhritrashtra's sons

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,740
you wouldn't attain respect.

40
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,840
Injustice and humiliation
are but two faces of a coin.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,960
When I had entered the ground

42
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,900
I wasn't friends with anyone.

43
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,870
Was I respected then?
- How would you have been?

44
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,960
You had no place on the ground.

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,970
When it comes
to a test of capabilities

46
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,810
every capable person
has a deserving place.

47
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,960
There should be!

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,770
Caste and creed are considered

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,740
as proof of power and
capabilities by this society.

50
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,760
Wouldn't it become weak
having lost those powers?

51
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,830
But only Prince Duryodhan
realised the truth.

52
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,970
Dhritrashtra's son
displayed that generosity.

53
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,810
He surely has selfish motives.
- He may.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,800
A 'yajna' aimed
at attaining something from God

55
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,700
is still a 'yajna', father.

56
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,810
It's not our duty to think about
Prince Duryodhan's motives.

57
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,840
To accept his favours

58
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,710
and offer love and dedication
in lieu is our duty, father.

59
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,900
Karna, the scriptures say
that charity and favour

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,690
if received from good men only

61
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,800
are worth accepting.

62
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,810
But I assume that you
are so disappointed

63
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,830
that you cannot see
righteousness.

64
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,800
Go, son

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,640
Fulfill your duties. 

66
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,840
Wouldn't you accompany
me, father?

67
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,640
How would I live without
you, mother?

68
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,800
Wouldn't you accompany me?

69
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,670
No, son.
We will stay here.

70
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,610
Someday when you need a house

71
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,770
which has never been
overshadowed by unrighteousness

72
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,640
you must have
a house to return to.

73
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,840
We will keep your house

74
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
away from misdeeds, Karna.

75
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,760
You must leave, son.

76
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,570
May you prosper.

77
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,570
Wouldn't you place the crown on
your son's head, mother?

78
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,640
So that its weight reminds me

79
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,600
of what have I lost in my life.

80
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,500
Son.

81
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,300
Son!

82
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,310
A relationship
that is tantamount to a duty

83
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,340
isn't up for choices,
Priyamvada.

84
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,500
I have to now go to my son.

85
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,390
Princess.

86
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,440
Princess, before you leave
you must promise me

87
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,240
that unless you do not
meet Karna

88
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,270
you wouldn't speak anything
about Karna to your five sons.

89
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,500
For the sake of a friend

90
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,430
you must make a promise,
Princess.

91
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,230
Only then would I let you go.

92
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,400
Just give me the promise.

93
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,190
Bheem?
- I am kidnapping you, mother

94
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,350
as I will be the first to
touch your feet.

95
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,290
But to touch her feet, you have
to place her on the ground.

96
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,210
Greetings mother.

97
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,150
Mother.

98
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,050
On seeing all of you
in the ground

99
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,250
I was so elated.

100
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,090
Sahadev

101
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,060
since when have you
become so competent, son?

102
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,150
And what about me?

103
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,090
When the ground trembled at
the blow of your mace

104
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,110
my trembling heart
became stable.

105
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,080
My Bheem.
- But

106
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,250
we were defeated.

107
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,090
I do not know that

108
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,020
but today

109
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,090
you have made your
mother victorious, sons.

110
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,990
Arjun, today all the ancestors

111
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,190
would be showering flowers
on your father.

112
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,110
It means

113
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,110
a bow is the supreme weapon.

114
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,090
I had said that
to brother Bheem.

115
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,190
Arjun, the bow is
perfect for you

116
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,180
and a mace is perfect for Bheem.

117
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,080
How are you, mother?

118
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,060
On our way, we had learned that
you had fainted.

119
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,150
How is your health now, mother?

120
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,990
Yes, actually

121
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,010
at the ground

122
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
when...

123
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,020
When I...
- ...saw two archers in a duel

124
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,020
the love for her son made
the Princess fall weak.

125
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,090
She is my childhood friend

126
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,120
Priyamvada.

127
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,050
Greetings!
- Greetings.

128
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Greetings.

129
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,020
I advised the Princess

130
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,960
that when she has
five capable sons

131
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,120
then why should she
be weak at heart?

132
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,060
Priyamvada, it's
a mother's heart.

133
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,080
When a competition

134
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,860
turns out to be a war
between the brothers...

135
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,950
Mother, we are the Pandavas

136
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,020
and they are a hundred Kauravas.

137
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,920
When they do not consider
us as brothers

138
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,980
why should we then be
affectionate towards them?

139
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,960
We are five of us
and are enough for each other.

140
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,090
Mother

141
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,850
we five brothers are like
the five fingers of a hand.

142
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,020
We neither need an extra brother

143
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,820
nor one less would
be sufficient.

144
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,880
And our brother Bheem
is the thumb.

145
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,050
That means if us four
brothers apply ashes on someone

146
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,880
brother Bheem will
do a tilak

147
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,820
and conclude the task.

148
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,990
That was said by Nakul.

149
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,980
Brother.

150
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,880
Sahadev, you have made me happy.

151
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,050
I am sure mother has
made 'laddoos' for me.

152
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,980
I will surely give you
one of those.

153
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,910
No, Bheem.

154
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,010
Now is not the time to eat.

155
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,790
Grandsire, the king
and uncle Vidur

156
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,880
are yet to be met with.

157
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,750
Mother

158
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,780
allow us to leave.

159
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,880
Princess, you must
think once again.

160
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
Please keep quiet, Priyamvada.

161
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I have agreed to whatever
you said.

162
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,840
I haven't spoken to my sons
about Karna yet.

163
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,820
Now, please let me go
and meet Karna.
