Grandfather used to worship
Lord Indra every year, Uncle.

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,230
But why did you decide against
worshipping him for once?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,320
Abhimanyu, my lad.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,350
All injustice that prevails
in the world is one.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,450
Because all injustice

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,360
arise out of one or the other
form of fear.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,320
I did not mean to oppose
the veneration for Lord Indra.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,260
But he was being venerated
solely out of fear.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,190
In fact, no one was
venerating Lord Indra, lad.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,300
Everyone was just venerating
the fear in their hearts.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,420
But isn't the prevalence of fear
obvious, uncle?

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,230
No, lad.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,260
In fact, there is no greater

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,350
foe in the world than fear.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,200
You better know
the consequences of fear.

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,230
In order to be free of fear

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,430
a human accepts injustice.

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,160
That is where evil is born.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,420
Ought to fear, a human mind

20

is filled with worry
and conflict.

He loses his ability to think.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,160
The mind or the soul
is destroyed.

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,200
Due to fear, a human mind
is filled with bitterness.

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,320
His entire life is filled
with bitterness.

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,090
The joy of living is lost.

163
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,370
S-Son. How could you
abandon your mother

164
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,390
and leave from here?

165
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,240
Brindavan shall wither away
waiting for you.

166
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,140
The shepherdesses

167
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,240
will be grieved by
your departure.

168
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,240
And your mother...

169
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,240
- Your mother shall die...
- No, mother!

170
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,400
My soul dwells within your body.

171
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,140
And I am taking your soul
along with me.

172
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,370
If the soul leaves your body
I shall die instead, mother.

173
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,130
But why, son?

174
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Why do you need to go?

175
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,230
My life's sole purpose
is to think of

176
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,170
protecting the entire creation.

177
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,170
And uncle Kansa
is just the beginning.

178
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,300
The end...

179
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,140
The end is still very far away,
mother.

180
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,370
I have to wander this
way incessantly for years.

181
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,270
And that life of a wanderer
begins today, mother.

182
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,300
Son.
Will you never ever return?

183
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,370
How can I return, mother?

184
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,270
I am leaving the Krishna
of Brindavan here

185
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,200
as I leave this place.

186
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,190
And the Krishna who is
going to Mathura

187
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,070
isn't the one you think he is,
mother.

188
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,300
When the river Ganga
flows down from the skies

189
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,070
she undergoes a lot of change.

190
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,110
She not just purifies earth

191
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,130
but get rendered polluted
by earth too.

192
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,070
She cannot return to Heaven,
mother.

193
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,130
Therefore...

194
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,290
Therefore...

195
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,000
[STUTTER]

196
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,170
Won't you remain
to be my son?

197
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,000
Will you be now
known as Devaki's son?

198
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,130
Mother Devaki gave me birth.

199
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,000
So some shall call me
the son of Devaki.

200
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,230
But I am fully confident

201
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,070
when I meet mother Devaki
for the first time

202
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,070
she shall surely address me
as the son of Yashoda.

203
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,160
And whoever shall know me
by your name

204
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,070
will know the true meaning
of duty and sacrifice.

205
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,000
Mother, bless me.

206
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,070

Won't you feed me butter

211
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,670
for one last time
before I leave?

212
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,530
Please feed me, mother!

213
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,370
Krishna!
