1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,880
Elder brother.
How could you shackle me?

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,290
Elder brother,
please set me free!

3
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,940
Elder brother,
please set me free!

4
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,710
Elder brother,
please set me free!

5
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,690
Pardon me, Prince!

6
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,530
Pardon me!

7
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,600
Will you imprison me?

8
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,600
Brother Duryodhan?

9
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,970
Friend!

10
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,580
Can you shackle me?

11
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,200
Duryodhan, my lad!
Imprison me if you dare!

12
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,410
Can you bear the weight

13
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,050
of your sins, Duryodhan?

14
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,910
My lad!

15
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Show me your might, lad!

16
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,370
Shackle me!

17
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,620
The arrest must be made
by yourself, son!

18
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,050
Who is in the prison?
Me?

19
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,170
Or you, brother Duryodhan?

20
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
Duryodhan!

21
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,930
What happened?

22
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,690
Why are you screaming?
What happened?

23
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,860
Will someone please tell me
what happened?

24
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,060
I shall grant you sight,
King Dhritarashtra!

25
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,910
See for yourself!

26
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,010
What... What sorcery is this?

27
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,730
What is it that I am seeing?

28
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,220
Take... Take back my sight!

29
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,540
I do not want it!

30
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,910
Forgive me, Krishna!

31
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,590
Forgive me!

32
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,330
My lad!
What happened?

33
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
Friend!

34
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,600
What illusion was that, Krishna?

35
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,120
It was not an illusion, Prince.

36
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,810
It was a premonition.

37
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,500
Soon death shall chase you
in the battlefield similarly.

38
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,460
And you shall not
be able to hide.

39
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,510
Because there is no use
running or hiding from death.

40
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,010
The day the spark of justice
shall ignite in the battlefield

41
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,490
right before your very eyes
the entire Kuru clan

42
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,220
will reduce to ashes!

43
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Farewell, King!

44
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,670
General...

45
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Gather the army right away.

46
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,200
Father, I need to avenge
for every insult

47
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,170
that hypocrite
has inflicted on me!

48
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,170
This moment,
we will attack Virat, Father!

49
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,460
We will attack for sure!

50
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,270
Are you still dreaming
about attacking, Prince? - Yes.

51
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,990
The foolish attempt you had made

52
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,390
to incarcerate Vasudev...
That moment...

53
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,960
That very moment,
we became incapacitated.

54
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
Forever and ever!

55
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,720
If you still have
some sense left in you, go...

56
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,930
Go and ask Vasudev
for forgiveness.

57
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,820
That’s impossible, Minister!

58
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,260
I...

59
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,910
I can never ask anyone
for forgiveness.

60
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,350
Never can I ask!

61
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,970
Will I get scared
of that devious person

62
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,690
who like a juggler

63
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,340
sets a bewitching trap?

64
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,910
I...
I...

65
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,280
I’ll finish him!

66
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,810
Whether or not he chooses
to fight in the battle

67
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,090
I...
I will for sure

68
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,100
put an end
to that grazier’s life!

69
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,180
I will surely do away with him!

70
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Friend...

71
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,710
Don’t take a decision
out of anxiety, friend.

72
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,990
Be calm and take a decision.
- Keep quiet!

73
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,840
I used to consider
you to be competent and strong!

74
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,090
Is this your strength?

75
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,300
When that cheat
was setting a trap

76
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,630
what were you doing
to protect me?

77
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,870
What were you doing?

78
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,800
It’s the duty
of the chief of army

79
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,080
to protect his king and prince.

80
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,050
But you remained seated
like a helpless woman!

81
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,700
All of you are weak!
Weak is what all of you are!

82
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,380
All of you
are just a bunch of cowards!

83
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,510
Nothing else!

84
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,200
But I don’t need anybody!

85
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,600
Nobody at all!

86
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,450
I’m capable enough
to take my revenge on my own!

87
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,170
Yes, on my own!

88
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,220
I’m capable enough!

89
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,510
Duryodhan...

90
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,350
Duryodhan!

91
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,470
Duryodhan has lost his senses!

92
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
Your Highness, Dhritarashtra!

93
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,920
Stop your son

94
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,570
else, he will be the cause
for a catastrophe!

95
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,970
Your Highness,
Vasudev is still in the kingdom.

96
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,020
He will be taking rest
in my chamber for some time.

97
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,700
Your Highness

98
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,340
please walk in,
and ask him for forgiveness.

99
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,750
Brother...

100
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,070
Please do this favour on me
for one last time.

101
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
Let it be, Vidhur.

102
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,440
Let it be.

103
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,530
Let this battle take place.

104
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,900
Not my righteousness

105
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,300
not Guru Drona’s teachings

106
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,070
neither the deceit of
the King of Gandhaar

107
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,830
nor the archery skills
of Anga Raj...

108
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,120
No one...

109
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,370
No one can protect
the Kauravas now.

110
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,460
All of us are now

111
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,710
approaching our end.

112
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,190
Krishna...

113
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,240
Did Duryodhan try to incarcerate
you in the court of assembly?

114
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,720
Destiny paves its way.

115
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,370
Humans only play a role
in executing destiny's plan

116
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,500
by using their intelligence
and culture.

117
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,790
Sister-in-law wishes
to apologise to you

118
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,750
on behalf of the sins
her sons have committed.

119
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,560
Greetings, Your Highness!

120
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,490
If you must

121
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,930
then apologise to your sons

122
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,260
to whom you didn't impart

123
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,540
the right teachings
at the right time.

124
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,710
You knew

125
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,120
that His Highness was
empoisoning your sons' minds

126
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,840
with revenge
and futile ambitions.

127
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,490
But still

128
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,130
you let your sons imbibe
the teachings he was imparting.

129
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,820
Now, the situation is such that

130
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,020
Duryodhan has crossed
all his limits.

131
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,030
Don't be resentful
at my sons, Vasudev.

132
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,750
They aren't aware

133
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,520
of the lightning pace at which
they are nearing their death.

134
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,770
No, Your Highness.

135
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,090
Resent is shown on those

136
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,220
who are knowledgeable enough
to make decisions.

137
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,190
Duryodhan's decisions

138
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,190
arise from his ignorance.

139
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,080
How can I be resentful at him?

140
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,800
I only sympathise with him.

141
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,770
Nothing else.

142
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,010
If you sympathise with him

143
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,900
why don't you refrain him
from commencing the battle?

144
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,780
The way fireflies get attracted
to the light of the flame

145
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,630
and get engulfed by it

146
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,760
Duryodhan is facing
a similar situation today.

147
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,880
How can he be stopped?

148
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,930
There must be a way out,
Krishna.

149
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,620
Vasudev, there must be some way

150
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
to protect my sons
from self-destruction?

151
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,110
Duryodhan has utmost belief
on Grand sire Bheeshm

152
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,830
Guru Drona
and on the Karna's capability.

153
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,680
Grand sire is helpless
because of his position.

154
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,730
Guru Drona...

155
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,890
He is helpless as he is bound
by the oath he had taken.

156
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,580
But Karna hasn't promised
anything to His Highness.

157
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,340
Karna

158
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,550
is bound by the oath
of friendship with Duryodhan.

159
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,760
Promises made to the king,
Guru, hermit and God

160
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,360
can't be broken at any cost.

161
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,130
But a promise given to a friend
can be broken

162
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,380
if it is
for the friend's well-being.

163
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,860
Please, stop Karna
from taking part in this battle.

164
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,470
I have full faith

165
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,950
that Duryodhan won't
have the courage to go to war.

166
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,520
Nothing is impossible
for you, Vasudev.

167
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,290
As long as a person doesn't...

168
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,700
make a conscious effort
to learn...

169
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,430
it becomes impossible
for even God to enlighten him.

170
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,070
Still...

171
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,320
If Karna's mother makes
an effort, it's possible

172
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,850
that Karna deters
from his decision...

173
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,250
to go to war.
