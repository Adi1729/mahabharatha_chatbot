1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,410
In everyone's life,
there comes an event

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,510
when one determines
to disclose a truth

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,480
but the truth isn't able
to come out of the mouth.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,350
Some fear embraces the heart.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,280
Talking about an incident
or event

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,350
or else talking about
any mistake which one commits...

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,520
Is that a true feeling?

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,280
No.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,280
This is just a fact.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,410
That means, just disclosing
exactly what happened

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,370
is usual.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,380
But sometimes, even while
disclosing that fact

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,340
one feels scared.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,510
Perhaps, one thinks about
the emotions of someone else.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,310
They even hesitate to speak
thinking it would hurt someone.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,250
So...what's truth?

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,280
Have we ever thought about it?

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,510
When someone reveals a fact
even though the fear exists

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,250
that's called the truth.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,440
In reality, truth is nothing

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,380
but another name of courage.

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,310
To be courageous one needn't
wait for the right time

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,280
because courageousness
is the nature of the soul.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,440
In other words

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,480
isn't every moment right enough
to disclose the truth?

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,440
Think about it.

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,210
'After a few months.'

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,380
Earlier, messages were being
conveyed through the drum beats.

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
But now, we have

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,350
stopped receiving messages
from the battlefield.

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,440
We'll receive a message.

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,250
And the message
will surely have a good news.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,350
There is a good news,
Queen Mother.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,280
King Pandu has defeated
his enemies in the battle.

35
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,110
I had faith

36
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,340
that in the first battle itself
Pandu will achieve victory.

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,370
Without any controversy,
he has proved himself

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,370
as an emperor.

39
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Organise a celebration
in the province.

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,180
Nothing should be lacking
in the welcome ceremony.

41
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,240
The period of your happiness
has started, Kunti.

42
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,200
On the very first day
of marriage

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,180
if a husband goes far away

44
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,270
I can understand how miserable
a wife feels.

45
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,270
I have no regrets,
sister-in-law.

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,170
The first and foremost right
of a king is on his throne.

47
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,250
To be at the second place

48
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,140
I don't have any objection.
- Never say so, Kunti.

49
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,340
When a husband doesn't
pay attention to his wife

50
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,110
her life becomes miserable.

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I wish, you always be
your husband's priority.

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,210
Now it's time to decorate
your room again.

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,270
Maid, go with the other maids

54
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,010
and decorate the king's room
in the best manner.

55
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,140
After the news of victory,
what other news can there be?

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,110
Is there any...bad news?

57
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,240
No, grandsire. The news
is not bad but...

58
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
What's the news, Chief Minister?

59
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,980
The news is

60
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,120
we, I mean, King Pandu
helped the province Madra

61
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,110
and protected it
from a fierce war.

62
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,980
Subsequently, the king of Madra
requested King Pandu...

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,180
He must...
He must have requested.

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,110
To refrain His Majesty
from refusing

65
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,980
he must have requested
in a way that... - Vidur

66
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,170
be clear about what
you wish to say.

67
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,120
Queen Mother, the king of Madra
had made King Pandu

68
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,980
his son-in-law.

69
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,140
King Pandu is coming here
with his second wife.

70
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,120
Make arrangements to welcome
King Pandu

71
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,080
and his newlywed wife,
Chief Minister.

72
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,140
'A king has many queens.'

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,920
'If King Pandu
does another marriage'

74
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,140
'this truth will become
troublesome for your life.'

75
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,940
'As it is, a secret is always
troublesome for a woman.'

76
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,690
The arrival of the second wife
of King Pandu in Hastinapur

77
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,720
and into his private chambers

78
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,590
is gladly welcome.

79
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,490
I had a fear that the news
of second marriage of Pandu

80
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,580
will make Kunti sulk.

81
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,590
I felt she wouldn't
welcome Madri

82
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,680
but look, sister

83
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,430
Kunti accepted Madri as
if they were sisters by blood.

84
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,590
The way clothes conceal wounds

85
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,620
similarly, words cloak
feelings, Ambalika.

86
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,480
Anyway, whatever I can
behold exudes auspiciousness.

87
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,650
You trust your eyes

88
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,610
but I have learnt from my son

89
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,620
that eyes seldom
are trustworthy.

90
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,460
Greetings, brother.

91
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,520
Hastinapur and I are
proud of you, Pandu.

92
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,630
Even I am proud of my victory.

93
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,620
On this occasion of victory

94
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,490
I would like to make
an announcement.

95
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,550
Ever since my childhood

96
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,590
I have looked up to only
one warrior.

97
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,430
He never accepted defeat.

98
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,360
He has always celebrated
his struggle.

99
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,360
With his robust character

100
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,520
he has crossed all boundaries

101
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,520
and become the most supreme.

102
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,430
Every move I made in the war was
done following his footsteps.

103
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,390
I always tried to be
worthy of him.

104
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,580
And this is the reason
behind my victory.

105
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,360
And this warrior is the biggest
inspiration of my life

106
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,350
and he is my elder
brother Dhritarashtra.

107
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,520
Pandu...
- Yes, brother...

108
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,590
<i>This victory is not mine
but yours.</i>

109
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,290
Only yours...

110
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,320
See...

111
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,420
It's more like he got
what he wanted

112
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,420
without putting in any efforts.

113
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,350
Stay blessed.

114
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,360
Greetings, grandsire.

115
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,260
I wish you a long life.

116
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Pandu, you have shown
immense valour.

117
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,460
We are proud of you, Pandu.

118
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,430
You must be tired.

119
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,260
Victory turns every
pain into pleasure.

120
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,450
No, Pandu...

121
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,450
Your body gets relief from pain

122
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,420
only after a proper rest.

123
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,390
You need to rest.

124
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,230
For a few months,
along with your wives

125
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,450
you shall go
on a forest excursion.

126
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,450
And that too immediately.
But, Queen Mother...

127
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,450
<i>Pandu...</i>

128
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,260
I don't want any
arguments.

129
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,190
It's a right of your wives

130
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,190
to spend some time with you.

131
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,350
This is an order.

132
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,210
Yes, Queen Mother.

133
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,490
Yours

134
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,470
and the king's room

135
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,590
is on the other side,
Madri.

136
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Rambha!

137
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Yes, Your Highness.

138
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,330
Show Madri

139
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,530
the way to her room.

140
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,360
What are you doing?

141
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,360
I am washing your feet
with my tears, sister.

142
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,500
I heard about
the king's valour in the battle.

143
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,430
And

144
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
I lost my heart to
him, sister.

145
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,560
But I didn't know

146
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,330
that His Highness
is already married.

147
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,530
I also didn't know that on
the very next day of marriage

148
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,530
he had to leave
for the battle.

149
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,400
Please forgive me, sister.

150
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,400
During our journey itself,
His Highness told me

151
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,340
that I have to apologise to you
the minute I get here.

152
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,300
I have wronged you.

153
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,330
But an unintentional
wrongful deed

154
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,460
is worthy of being excused,
right, sister?

155
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,270
Won't you accept your
younger sister's apology?

156
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,270
You are not at fault,
Madri.

157
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,360
Don't be sad.

158
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,440
In this palace you will
receive the love and respect

159
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,360
that I get.

160
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,170
After hearing your words

161
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,230
I feel at peace, sister.

162
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,430
I was thinking about you
throughout the journey.

163
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,200
Whether or not to be a subject
of His Highness' affection

164
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,330
I would have to
compete with you.

165
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,400
Or if I would lose to you
in this competition.

166
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,290
I had such doubts.

167
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,390
There is no competition

168
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,400
between us.

169
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,330
That I understood
on seeing you.

170
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,300
I am younger than you

171
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,200
and also much prettier.

172
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,270
If there would be
no competition between us

173
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,300
that would be best for you.

174
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,360
I will leave now.

175
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,230
His Highness must be
waiting for me.

176
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,360
The state of Queen Kunti

177
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,120
saddens me, my lady.

178
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,160
Even I feel sad, Sukhda.

179
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,330
But kings having more
than one wife

180
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,290
is a tradition.

181
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,120
In the presence of pain

182
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,340
and the absence of options
rather than accepting the same

183
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,190
it is referred to
as tradition.

184
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,290
But I completely
trust Pandu.

185
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,070
He will treat both his
wives equally.

186
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,090
Injustice isn't a part of
Pandu's nature.

187
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,070
And neither a part of
his ethics.

188
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,160
Haven't Kunti and Madri gone
with Pandu

189
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,100
on an excursion to the forest?

190
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Just wait and watch

191
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,070
Kunti and Madri will
definitely get along.

192
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes, my lady.

193
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,190
Queen Kunti's nature
itself is as such

194
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,120
that anyone would
get along.

195
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,160
And both the wives will receive
love from their husband.

196
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,240
Not being able to receive
a husband's love

197
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,190
is the greatest misfortune.

198
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,030
Greetings, Elder Queen.

199
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,230
Prince Dhritarashtra has sent
a message for you

200
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,000
to come to his chamber.

201
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,090
He has called me!

202
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,170
Yes, Your Highness.
He has called for you.
