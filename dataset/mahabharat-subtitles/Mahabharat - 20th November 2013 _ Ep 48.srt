1
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,880
In spite of you not being a king

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,110
my father sends you
his greetings.

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,970
And now, let me greet you.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,920
I am sorry to hear that your
father died in the forest.

5
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,070
When the sun distances
itself from the earth

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,010
the earth is covered
with darkness.

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,120
When a father is away
from a son

8
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,110
the son's life is covered
with darkness.

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,080
Thus, intelligent people keep
a part of the sun

10
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,010
which is a lamp, they
always keep it with them.

11
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,850
Sir, I too have kept a part

12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,810
of my father with me.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,940
The dices.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,040
They have been made from
the ashes of my late father.

15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,070
When alive

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,970
my father agreed with me
most of the times.

17
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,940
And now, he agrees
to everything I say.

18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,040
Five.

19
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,810
The son of Bharadwaj

20
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,750
the great teacher Dronacharya
arrives!

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,810
Greetings, Sire.

22
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,880
We welcome you, Dronacharya.
- Thank you.

23
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,850
The king wishes to know

24
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,810
what progress the princess have
made at your hermitage?

25
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,970
The king would also like to know

26
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,810
what is the capability
of each prince.

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,940
May king Dhritarashtra prosper.

28
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,870
My great father

29
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,820
the great sage Bharadwaj
would feel proud

30
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,840
such is the knowledge I have
imparted to the princes, O King.

31
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,950
The souls of your departed
ancestors would be pleased

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,940
such is the knowledge
derived by the princes.

33
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,740
I am sure my son Duryodhan
is the best of all.

34
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,220
Isn't he?

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,740
Why are you quiet,
O great teacher Dronacharya?

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,780
Your Majesty, I am quiet

37
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,810
as I wonder whether I should

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,710
sing the praises of my students

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,120
or should my students
exhibit the knowledge

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,880
I imparted them and thus
earn praises for my teaching.

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,710
What would be appropriate?

42
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,680
The teacher is right.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,780
It's a tradition.

44
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,770
When the princes return
on completing their studies

45
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,850
before the subjects
of the kingdom

46
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,680
and before the special
guests invited

47
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,910
they should exhibit
their skills.

48
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,870
Exhibition!

49
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,780
We have a different
tradition at Gandhar.

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,870
Hastinapur follows its
traditions, prince of Gandhar!

51
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,620
Sir, it's the king of Gandhar.

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,780
King of Gandhar.

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,720
Thanks to your blessings
and favors

54
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,680
I am now the king of Gandhar.

55
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,680
I am informing the fine
traditions of my kingdom

56
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,740
to the king of Hastinapur.

57
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,810
Your majesty, in my kingdom
it is believed

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,780
that two people can
make similar swords

59
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,770
but no two swordsmen

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,670
can be alike.

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,870
Thus, your majesty, we hold a
competition at our kingdom

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,610
especially so that, when the
winner is hailed

63
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,680
the entire world learns

64
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,810
who has acquired how much
competence.

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,680
Now if the princes of Hastinapur

66
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,680
wish to exhibit their skills
like dancers

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,650
his highness would know better.
- King of Gandhar!

68
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,680
Hastinapur... - Has a great
tradition, Sire!

69
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,750
It's an excellent tradition.

70
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,570
The pleasure that lies
in a competition

71
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,710
doesn't lie in an exhibition.

72
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,550
We will hold a competition
among the princes.

73
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,540
Besides

74
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,650
I wouldn't be able to see them
exhibit their skills, Sire.

75
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,770
But on hearing the people
hail my sons

76
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
my heart would feel content.

77
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,740
Dronacharya

78
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,580
organize a competition that
you find appropriate.

79
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,710
The princes would mock fight
each other in the competition.

80
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,710
I would like to know

81
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,480
which prince is eligible to be

82
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,650
heir to the throne
of Hastinapur.

83
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,600
A competition!

84
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Vidur, why are we
talking about a competition?

85
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,570
My elder brother

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,710
is eager to prove that Duryodhan
is the most eligible one, Sire.

87
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,510
I am apprehensive,
before all the invited guests

88
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,550
and the subjects

89
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,550
if there develops an animosity
between the princes

90
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,480
it would have dire
consequences, Sire.

91
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,640
In any situation

92
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,480
this competition shouldn't
become a duel, Vidur.

93
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,410
We have to supervise
it all the time.

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,550
Greetings, Sire.
- May you live long, dear.

95
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,470
I will not let the arrival of
the princes turn into politics.

96
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,550
I promise you.

97
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Kunti.

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,420
Once I had asked you
to trust me and you did.

99
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,540
Today, what has suddenly
happened

100
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,640
for you to not have faith in me?

101
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,640
But Sire, the test
of the princes.

102
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,540
It would be appropriate
that my sons

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,640
don't take part
in this competition.

104
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,580
I hope people do not consider
their capabilities as ambitions

105
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,580
and be enemies with them.

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,380
I fear of that, Sire.

107
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,420
Who are you scared of,
sister-in-law?

108
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,420
Are you scared of Shakuni,
the king of Gandhar?

109
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,380
Don't have any kind of fear,
Kunti.

110
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,610
The snake whose venom
is extracted once

111
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,420
the next time it gives up its
venom very easily.

112
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,520
Because its previous experience

113
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,580
stops it from opposing.

114
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,580
Don't fear Shakuni.

115
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,410
Besides

116
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,480
he can no longer conspire.

117
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,510
He too would understand the
burden of responsibilities.

118
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,380
He is now the king of a state.

119
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,380
The great Bheeshma had made

120
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,470
a grave mistake by expelling me.

121
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,350
Pardon me, your majesty.

122
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,540
But my status will always
be less than the great Bheeshma.

123
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,480
Thus, before becoming a part
of your scheme

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
I would have to think
a hundred times.

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,310
An ant doesn't get trampled

126
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,470
under the feet of
an elephant, Purochan.

127
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,420
You are a man of low stature.

128
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,450
The great Bheeshma won't
be watching you.

129
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,450
Think about it.

130
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,380
If you help me in my plans

131
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,340
you will be enormously
prosperous.

132
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,280
And if you do not...

133
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,310
What are you planning,
your majesty?

134
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,510
Leave us alone!

135
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,280
The king wishes

136
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,350
to hear the people hail Prince
Duryodhan at the playground

137
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,340
and not anyone else.

138
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,480
Thus, the entrance door that you
will build for the playground

139
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,470
should collapse at
the right time.

140
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,280
With just one arrow.

141
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,140
The king wishes

142
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,260
to hear the people hail Prince
Duryodhan at the playground

143
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,100
and not anyone else.

144
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,370
Thus, the entrance door that you
build for the playground

145
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,370
should collapse at
the right time.

146
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,140
With just an arrow.

147
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,200
When it collapses, the person
standing beneath it

148
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,310
should reach kingdom come.

149
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,210
Will you be able
to fulfill the plan?

150
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,070
Who is this meant for,
king of Gandhar?

151
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,140
For the one

152
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,270
who Duryodhan may
not be able to defeat.

153
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,200
Are you making arrangements for
the test, son? - No, father.

154
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,270
I am making arrangements to
make my friend Duryodhan win.

155
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,260
You would have benefited, had
you befriended Arjun, son.

156
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,260
The scriptures say

157
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,040
one should always befriend
someone who is more intelligent

158
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,100
or more powerful than you.

159
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,160
Such friendship ends
in animosity.

160
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,200
There is one more
important thing.

161
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,160
The one who is the best

162
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,230
never needs anyone.

163
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,200
Thus, he's merciful

164
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,260
and doesn't befriend anyone.

165
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,000
I and Duryodhan
need each other.

166
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,100
He needs my help to attain
the throne of Hastinapur.

167
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,260
That's impossible.

168
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,030
The heir of Hastinapur

169
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,190
will be appointed
based on eligibility.

170
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,230
And eligibility

171
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,200
cannot be proven with
somebody's help.

172
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,990
To me, this is an opportunity

173
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,970
to make my friendship
with Duryodhan stronger.

174
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,090
So that, when I become
a king in the future

175
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,030
Hastinapur should
stand to protect me.

176
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,130
Father.

177
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,230
I have spent my life considering
a mixture of flour as milk.

178
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,070
I never asked for anything.
I never objected to anything.

179
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,200
But today, I ask of you.

180
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,000
Whatever happens in the
competition held for the princes

181
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,140
let it happen the way it is.

182
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,970
Son...

183
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,000
I cannot be unrighteous for you.

184
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,940
But you can at least keep quiet.

185
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,910
I need your assurance

186
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,100
that you will keep quiet.

187
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,000
And you will let

188
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,130
things happen the way they are.

189
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,520
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

190
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,290
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

191
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

192
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,420
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

193
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,450
Attention!

194
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,390
King Dhritarashtra
is on his way!

195
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,290
I was waiting for this day

196
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,290
since the last twelve
years, Your Majesty.

197
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,380
And you have promised
that this day

198
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,450
will be the most happiest day
of my life, Shakuni.

199
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,420
I am sure there is nothing
lacking in your arrangements.

200
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,490
If my nephews are hailed
by the people

201
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,390
only then this day would be
the happiest day for me, O king.

202
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,480
And I never make mistakes
for the sake of my happiness.

203
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,420
Greetings, sister.
- Come Kunti, sit here

204
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,240
next to me.

205
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,420
Today, I want to see my
sons with your eyes.

206
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,380
I mean, your sons too.

207
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,250
Greetings, aunt Kunti.

208
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,280
Bless you, Dushala.

209
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,380
Aren't you anxious to watch
the prowess of your brothers?

210
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,380
I am really excited.

211
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,380
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

212
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,320
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

213
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,390
Subjects!

214
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,250
Today many brave Aryan kings

215
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,320
and princes have arrived
in Hastinapur

216
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,410
to witness the strength of the
new generation of the Kurus.

217
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,350
To get introduced to the
strength of the Kuru dynasty

218
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,320
I welcome everyone
to Hastinapur.

219
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,350
Today on this playground

220
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,180
bravery and potential
would be exhibited.

221
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,220
And it shall reverberate in all
corners of the earth.

222
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,260
The praises would be heard

223
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,250
till the end of time!

224
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,220
Today, on this playground
a new history would begin.

225
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,190
The future of the
divine nation established

226
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,260
by the great Kuru ancestors
shall be decided.

227
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,310
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

228
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,120
Long live king Dhritarashtra!

229
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,090
To begin the competition

230
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,380
the one to arrive on
the playground

231
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,310
would be the son of the great
sage Bharadwaj

232
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,150
the disciple of Parshuram

233
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,120
the one as radiant as fire

234
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
the great teacher Drona!

235
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,190
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

236
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,090
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

237
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,280
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

238
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,150
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

239
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,120
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

240
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,160
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

241
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,190
May the great king of
the Kuru dynasty

242
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,190
Dhritarashtra prosper.

243
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
Over there on the device

244
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,050
the names of all the princes
have been inscribed.

245
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,050
My son, Ashwathama

246
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,160
will shoot an arrow
at the device.

247
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,250
The name of the prince that
is highlighted on the device

248
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,090
will arrive at the playground

249
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,050
and fight a duel against
the winning prince.

250
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,180
The prince

251
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,160
who would stand as a winner
on the ground until sunset

252
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,220
that prince will be considered
the most capable.

253
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,020
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

254
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,150
Long live the great teacher
Dronacharya!

255
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,080
A rule has been decided
for the competition.

256
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,220
No prince can make
another prince bleed.

257
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,090
If that happens

258
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,120
the prince will be disqualified
from the competition.

259
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,180
The competition is a game taking
place between brothers

260
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,220
and no prince has the right
to turn it into war.

261
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,150
You can now begin
the competition.

262
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,090
Long live the great Bheeshma!

263
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,090
Long live the great Bheeshma!
