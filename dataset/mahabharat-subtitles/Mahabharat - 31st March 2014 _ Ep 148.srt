1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,210
So, Your Highness

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,020
which of your brothers

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,250
are you going to put at stake?

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,120
Impossible!

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,190
Prince Duryodhan,
in the game of dice

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,120
you can only wager property.
You cannot put humans at stake.

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,240
But this game

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,190
is not for property,
Prime Minister.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,180
He has himself said

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,250
that humans play
for their pride.

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,020
And one always puts
his pride at stake

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,020
when playing-

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,010
Humans are proud of
many things, prince.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,150
Knowledge acquired.
A father's dutifulness.

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,020
Mother's purity.
And one's lineage.

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,220
But these cannot be
put at stake.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,120
Because humans have no
right over it, grandsire.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
Father, mother, teacher and heir

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,210
are all God's blessings,
grandsire.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,210
Anything that you have
a right on and you are proud of

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,990
can be put at stake

22
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,110
you have said it, grandsire.

23
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,050
This is a pointless
discussion, Duryodhan.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,110
Parents have rights
on their children

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,080
but I haven't heard of anyone
having a right on his siblings.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,020
Prime Minister Vidur

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,980
you had acceded to
King Pandu's authority

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,220
and you also accept
King Dhritarashtra's authority.

29
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,090
Don't you?

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,920
Excellent.
Absolutely excellent.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,990
So it's clear

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,990
that my dear Duryodhan

33
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,990
has the right on his
younger brother Vikarna

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,020
and he is also proud of
him, Your Highness.

35
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,910
So, Prince Duryodhan,
can put his brother Vikarna

36
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,950
at stake.

37
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,050
If His Highness deems it fit

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,890
he can abide by the rules.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,920
So tell me,
Your Highness

40
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,910
which of your brothers
will you put at stake?

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,120
He will put me at stake.

42
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,110
No, Nakul.

43
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,050
No...
- Nakul

44
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
not you.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
No, Nakul.

46
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,010
Long live the Empress.

47
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,090
What happened?

48
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,090
Hastinapur's Prince has put
his younger brother Vikarna

49
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,910
at stake.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,820
And Prince Nakul has volunteered
from the emperor's side.

51
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,980
What kind of a game is this?

52
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,010
Are humans and relationships
meant to be put at stake?

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,820
Demons and serpents perform
the 'Narmedh Yajna'

54
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,860
where humans are sacrificed.

55
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,860
Is Hastinapur too inculcating
this tradition, Your Highness?

56
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,980
Had Krishna been here

57
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,020
he would have definitely stopped
this game of dice.

58
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,760
But King Shaka has
attacked Dwarka.

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,790
Krishna is fighting a battle
to protect Dwarka.

60
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,950
Queen Gandhari...

61
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,810
Queen Gandhari

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,980
we have to stop this game,
immediately.

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,980
Kunti

64
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,920
when grandsire and Vidur
are unable to stop it

65
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,850
then there must be
an ethical dilemma involved.

66
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,910
How will I be able
to resolve this?

67
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,780
I will resolve this.

68
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Maid

69
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,950
go tell the Emperor

70
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,880
that the five petals of hibiscus

71
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,940
are connected to its stem

72
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,790
not to each other.

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,790
He doesn't have the right
to put my husband at stake.

74
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Go right away and tell him.
- As you command, Your Highness.

75
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,780
No, Nakul.
I cannot put you at stake.

76
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,880
Brother, it will be appropriate
for you to put me at stake.

77
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,810
If you lose,
then Arjun's competency

78
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,810
and the strength of
brother Bheem will be with you.

79
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
Brother Bheem and brother Arjun
will be able to get me released

80
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,760
but I won't be able
to get them released.

81
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
If you are in a dilemma then put
brother Bheem at stake, Emperor!

82
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,690
If you are defeated
then serving me as a slave

83
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,720
will be quite easy for him.

84
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,720
Nakul may die
toiling as a slave.

85
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,850
Pick up your weapon, Dushasana!

86
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,690
Let's decide right away
as to who will die!

87
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,580
Dear Bheem!

88
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,720
This is the game of dice,
not a battlefield.

89
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,660
Challenging a kingdom that has
surrendered to you, for war

90
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,520
is unrighteousness, son.

91
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,520
Calm down.

92
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,680
Calm down, Bheem.

93
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,580
I will put my...

94
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,580
I'll put my younger brother
Nakul... - Greetings, Emperor!

95
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,560
I have a message
from the Empress.

96
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,620
I can't put my younger
brother Nakul at stake.

97
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,460
I am definitely proud of him
but I have no rights over him.

98
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,510
I don't have any rights over
any of my brothers!

99
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,510
We brothers are interconnected
like the petals of hibiscus

100
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,520
but through the medium
of our wife Draupadi.

101
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,460
She has the right over us.

102
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,450
That's why...

103
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,590
This game is over now.

104
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,550
Emperor...

105
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,480
I have a question.
Will you please answer?

106
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,510
Does a branch grow on the
tree, first

107
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,550
or a flower petal?

108
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,540
Emperor...

109
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,520
Empress came much

110
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,380
later into your life.

111
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,390
All five of you

112
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,580
got married to her.

113
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,320
Were you not brothers
before that?

114
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,320
Didn't you share
any relationship?

115
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,390
Prince Nakul, answer me.

116
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,490
Didn't the Emperor

117
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,510
have any rights on you
before marriage?

118
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,350
After getting married

119
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,310
did you give that right
to your wife?

120
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,080
Didn't the Emperor

121
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,110
have any rights on you
before marriage?

122
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,940
After getting married

123
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,110
did you give that right
to your wife?

124
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,870
It means

125
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,010
if the Emperor, upon
seeing a hibiscus flower

126
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,110
quits the game

127
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,850
then it will be violation
of the rules.

128
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,980
And unrighteousness, as well.

129
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,920
I put my younger brother Nakul
at stake.

130
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,850
Emperor, if you get six points

131
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,940
then you shall
win over Duryodhan.

132
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,720
Emperor, Duryodhan's
first pawn has won.

133
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,880
You just need
four points to reach the fort.

134
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,680
Emperor, it is unfortunate.

135
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,910
You just needed four points

136
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,680
but you got five points.

137
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,700
You got one extra point.

138
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,700
Now if Duryodhan's pawn
beats yours

139
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,740
then he will win the bet.

140
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,830
One, two, three, four

141
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,660
five, six, seven.

142
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
In order to beat Emperor's pawn

143
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,830
I just need seven points.

144
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,670
Then, Nakul will be my slave.

145
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Come on.

146
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,680
Emperor, rejoice.

147
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,650
You lost your younger brother
Nakul.

148
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,640
The place of a slave
and the footwear

149
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,550
lies at the master's feet.

150
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,640
Nakul

151
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,680
come here.

152
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,520
Come and kneel among
these slaves.

153
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,480
Come here!

154
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,450
My brother is as pious
as Lord Ram's impressions.

155
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,550
I will make sure he dominates
you, brother Duryodhan!

156
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,620
The kind of behaviour I dispense

157
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,610
to my slaves, is none of

158
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,450
Prince Arjun's concern, Emperor!

159
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,670
It is only mine.

160
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,610
Calm down, Arjun.

161
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,410
Calm down.

162
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,580
Slave Nakul, come here!

163
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,470
Come and sit among these slaves.

164
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,480
Come!

165
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,540
Sit down, slave Nakul.
