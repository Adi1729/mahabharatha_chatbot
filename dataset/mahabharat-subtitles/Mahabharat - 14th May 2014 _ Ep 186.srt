1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,400
O storyteller

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,480
tell us something more about
Dwarka's regent, Krishna.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,880
So be it, Prince Uttar.
Along with brother Balram

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,120
the frolics of Lord Krishna, in Vrindavan.*
*A town 10 km from Mathura, an ancient forest, where Krishna spent his childhood days.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
The son of Yashoda,
had mesmerised the world.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,400
Capers of the naughty
and cute Lord Krishna.

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,040
He stole butter, played pranks
and annoyed men and women alike.

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,960
Make haste! Why are you looking
back, Koumudi?

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,120
I am afraid, the boys of Nand
might be hidden here.

10
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,320
That day, when I went to deliver
butter to the palace of Pathua

11
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,120
those wicked boys
broke my pitcher.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
Yashoda's son loves butter,
Shubhangi.

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
But little do those boys know

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,320
that if this butter doesn't
reach King Kans' palace

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
his soldiers would punish us.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
They are unaware of
King Kans' fury.

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,920
Don't worry. Yashoda kept
Krishna hungry, all day.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,520
Moreover, she punished him
by tying him to a tree.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,080
He will not dare to break
your pitcher, now.

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,040
She doesn't know what
all can Krishna do.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
Balram, had Krishna been here

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,600
he would've given them
a befitting reply.

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,600
But where is he?

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's search for him.
- Where?

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,120
Come on, let's search for him.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,640
Krishna!
- Krishna... - Krishna!

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,960
Krishna...
- Krishna! - Krishna...

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,600
Krishna...

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
Krishna...

30
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,400
Krishna...

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,560
Krishna...

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,520
Krishna...

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,680
There you go, again he is
playing the flute!

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,280
Why does he play a flute while
herding cows?

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,000
Aren't we here to listen
to this music?

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,520
Oh, yes... Krishna!

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,880
Krishna, those maidens are
taking butter to Mathura.

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
Butter!

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
Krishna, we'll be punished
severely, if we get caught.

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,640
Two days back, my father
spanked me so badly

41
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,600
that even now, I can't sit.

42
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,320
Eat some butter and apply
some on your wounds.

43
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
Everything will be fine.

44
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,840
Do mix turmeric* in it.
*A perennial plant of the ginger family.

45
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,680
Come on, Krishna.
Take out your catapult.

46
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,600
Look at that!

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,680
One by one, Krishna broke
all their pitchers

48
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,200
and is stealing butter and milk,
as always.

49
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
He'll be punished.

50
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,200
Last time, he stole clothes.
- Come on.

51
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
Wicked! Wait...

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,920
Run!

53
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,560
Yashoda!

54
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
Yashoda!

55
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,080
Yashoda, look what your
Krishna has done.

56
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,320
He ate away three day's butter!

57
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,360
If you can't control that monkey
of yours

58
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,880
you should tie him up, at home.
- Your kids may be monkeys!

59
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,520
My Krishna's beauty
is captivating.

60
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Then keep admiring him, all day.

61
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,760
Why is he making our lives
miserable?

62
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Better if you punish him,
else we'll have to do something.

63
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,680
Let me see.

64
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,560
But if he hasn't eaten
the butter, remember

65
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,120
I'll give you a punishment that
you'll remember all your life.

66
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
Come on.
- Yes, surely.

67
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,480
Smacking the butter on his lips,
Krishna was relishing it!

68
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,360
People of Mathura were satiated
when he burped!

69
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Krishna, you are again
being mischievous!

70
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Because of you, these women
reprimand me.

71
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't you care for your mother?
Tell me, you wicked.

72
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,880
Mother, it hurts.

73
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,400
It hurts me too.
When they complain to me.

74
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,040
Did you steal butter again?
- No, mother. I didn't steal it.

75
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,560
Liar! Look at the traces
of butter on his lips.

76
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,600
This butter?

77
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Actually, when I got the butter
after breaking your pitcher

78
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
he told me to eat some!

79
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,400
I said, 'I don't eat
stolen butter'.

80
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,760
'All of you can have it'.

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,160
Then Madhumangal, forcibly,

82
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,320
fed me this butter.

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,760
Saw that? My son disregards
stolen items.

84
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,040
Now, go away!

85
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,320
Hey, but he broke the pitcher!
- But I didn't eat the butter!

86
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,040
But your mother had
to face all this.

87
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,680
Come on, time for some
punishment from your father.

88
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,080
Come on. come on...

89
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,200
Mother! I didn't eat the butter!
- I know, come on.

90
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,200
Come on!

91
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Come...

92
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
Come.

93
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,400
We have to give half
of the harvest to Kans.

94
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
In the entire empire

95
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,640
farmers give one-fourth of the
harvest, as tax.

96
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,560
But, Kans...
Kans demands half the share!

97
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,120
He keeps half of it and gives
the other half to Magadha.

98
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,840
In turn, Magadha offers him
protection.

99
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,640
Magadha's greed and
Kans' hunger for power

100
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
will annihilate all the Yadavs,
Respected Nand.

101
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,320
We'll not bear this injustice
for long.

102
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,720
Kans will be killed, soon.
- Who will kill him?

103
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Somebody will surely come.

104
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Surely...

105
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,320
Have faith.

106
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
Dear!

107
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,640
Kans will be killed.

108
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,640
But before that he will
kill all of us.

109
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,480
What makes you say that,
Yashoda?

110
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,600
Why will he kill us?

111
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,640
When all these maidens

112
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,560
go to give milk, butter and ghee,* as tax
*A class of clarified butter.

113
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,760
Krishna and his friends
break their pitchers.

114
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
They also sneak into their
houses and eat all the butter.

115
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
Krishna! Come here.

116
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,320
There you go, ask your son.

117
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Now, what will they do?

118
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,520
Where will they get
so much butter from?

119
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,680
How will they pay
their tax to Kans?

120
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,360
Don't you know
what Kansa can do?

121
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,600
But you do know

122
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,960
what us children can do, mother.

123
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
You can do anything.

124
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,320
The cereals meant for the
people of the kingdom

125
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,760
is fed to the cows by you.

126
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,920
And you feed the fruits
to the monkeys.

127
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,720
Why do you want
to make Kansa our foe?

128
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,280
Father

129
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,440
it's our land, our effort,
our cattle

130
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
and products obtained
from their milk.

131
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,080
They are the cereals, fruits
and flower that we grow.

132
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,480
Why should Kansa relish them?

133
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
That's not ethical.

134
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,620
You are right, my son.

135
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,420
But we are helpless.

136
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,260
Kansa possesses the strength
of Jarasandh from Magadh.

137
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,020
A cattle gives up on food
when unwell

138
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,780
which makes
its condition worse.

139
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,500
So, rather than
being helpless here

140
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,100
it would be better

141
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,860
if we relocate
to a different place

142
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,260
for some time.

143
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,220
We can move to Vrindavan.

144
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,580
My friend Vrishbhan
can shelter us there.

145
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,180
But to move to Vrindavan,
we'll have to cross river Yamuna.

146
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,460
How are we going to do that?

147
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,420
The river is
the abode of serpent Kaliya

148
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,700
and he has established
its right over the Yamuna river.

149
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,860
He doesn't allow anyone
to cross the river.

150
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,500
He is the son of Kali.

151
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,660
How are we going to defeat
this seven headed serpent?

152
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,060
On one hand there's Kansa,
and on the other, serpent Kaliya.

153
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,180
How are we going
to get any relief?

154
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Krishna!
- Krishna!

155
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,100
Krishna!
- Krishna!

156
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,580
Krishna!
- Krishna!

157
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,180
Krishna!
- Krishna!

158
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,340
Krishna, don't be audacious.

159
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,140
Serpent Kaliya has spared
no one alive.

160
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,540
But we can't be as evil
as the serpent Kaliya.

161
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,740
I will surely spare him alive.

162
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,220
Don't you worry, Madhumangal.

163
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,140
Krishna!

164
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,060
Krishna...

165
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,060
Krishna...
- Krishna!

166
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,820
Krishna!
- Krishna!

167
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,340
Krishna...
- Krishna!

168
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,820
Krishna!
- Krishna!

169
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,420
Krishna!
- Krishna!

170
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,900
Foolish boy...
Who are you?

171
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,420
How dare you come
to this river

172
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,220
which is the abode
of serpent Kaliya!

173
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,340
Everyone has a right on
the water of this river, Kaliya.

174
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,460
You have turned
this water body poisonous.

175
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,460
Leave this river
as soon as possible

176
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,940
else, you will be punished.

177
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,300
Foolish boy!
Look at my size

178
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,140
and that of yours.

179
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,820
How are you going to
punish me?

180
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,860
Leave this place.

181
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,820
I warn you for the last time.

182
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,500
Krishna...
- Krishna!

183
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,900
Krishna!
- Krishna!

184
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,420
My King, please do something.

185
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,780
Forgive me, Krishna.
Don't kill me.

186
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,180
I will follow your order

187
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,260
but I am safe in the waters
of Yamuna.

188
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Your forehead
now bears my footmarks.

189
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,700
That will keep you safe,
wherever you are

190
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,140
as long as you don't
harm a living being.

191
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,460
My King, please do something.

192
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,140
Save my son.

193
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,940
Krishna!

194
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,860
Krishna...
- Krishna! - Krishna!

195
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,260
Krishna!

196
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,420
You displayed such courage,
Vasudev!

197
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,020
Were you aware that you
are going to defeat Kaliya?

198
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,060
Of course I was aware of it.

199
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,100
God has blessed me
with special powers.

200
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,180
Hence, he was meant
to be defeated by me.

201
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,700
What kind of special powers?

202
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,140
God has blessed me
with a great power.

203
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,820
Do you what to know,
what it is?

204
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,780
The power to put my effort.

205
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,140
I am definite

206
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,980
that if with my effort,
courage and devotion

207
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,380
nothing is impossible.

208
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,780
But, uncle, all of us
make an effort.

209
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,580
You are right, Satsom.

210
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,340
Everyone puts an effort

211
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,220
and that's
the only thing necessary

212
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,420
to emerge victorious.

213
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,020
The fact is,
there's no special power

214
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,980
that God has only
blessed me with.

215
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
God never differentiates
between his children.

216
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,380
Everyone is born with
powers that are necessary.

217
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,060
But reasons such as
fear, attachment and greed

218
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,260
stop a person from trying.

219
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,180
And one who doesn't try

220
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,980
can never be successful,
my dear.
