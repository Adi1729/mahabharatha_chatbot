1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,790
Uncle.

2
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,810
Greetings!

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,750
Bless you, Kunti!

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,550
You seem worried.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,660
Come.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,780
I come here

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,620
to put a burden on your 
shoulder, uncle.

8
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,710
No one is more capable than you

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,660
whose shoulder can withstand 
the weight of this world.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,590
For a youth, the world's burden

11
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,680
brings honor.

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,750
And to have such burden

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,620
brings about joy.

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,710
After a while,

15
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,650
that burden becomes duty.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,620
And assuming such duty 
becomes one's pride.

17
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,650
After that the world's burden

18
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,790
becomes responsibility.

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,520
And assuming that responsibility

20
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,690
brings one's satisfaction.

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,710
However at my age now

22
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,710
the world's burden

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,740
is punishment.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,580
My shoulder can lift

25
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,560
a mountain.

26
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,590
However my heart,

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,680
my heart has no strength to lift

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
the burden of responsibility anymore.

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,720
But this is my last request, uncle.

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,520
I...

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,680
I have Ganges water,
on the one hand,

32
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,420
and 'Panchamrit'* on the other...
*A mixture of five foods used in Hindu worship and puja, usually honey, sugar, milk, yogurt, and ghee.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,650
Which one should I throw away

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,420
and which one should I keep, uncle?

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
You are greedy to hold both of them,

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
but how was it came to be, Kunti?

37
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,390
Both Arjun and Karna

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,420
bound by their oath.

39
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,680
I know about your secret, Kunti.

40
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,520
Please forgive me, uncle.

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,390
I made a mistake during my youth

42
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,510
and I repent for this.

43
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,410
Then why are you telling 
me now, Kunti?

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,390
Because

45
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,580
Karna and Arjun had taken oath 
to slay each other.

46
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,620
And just thinking about it,

47
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,590
is like pushing a stake 
through my heart.

48
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,520
Karna fights for the unrighteous people,

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,510
but there is still truth in his heart, uncle.

50
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,320
Please protect them both, uncle.

51
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,450
Protecting Karna is not 
my responsibility

52
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,520
and Arjun do not need protection.

53
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,390
But

54
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,580
Karna is also your grandchild, uncle.

55
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,420
Only children with the consent of 
your husband

56
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,480
are my grandchildren.

57
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,290
But before you got married

58
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,450
any child you have

59
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,550
do not belong to Kuru dynasty.

60
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,410
I understand what's in your mind, Kunti.

61
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,380
Suffering is also part of my destiny

62
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,290
but

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,550
I'll try to sefeguard you from it.

64
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,410
Bless you, Kunti.

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,420
Dusshasan

66
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,290
regardless of gransire's battle formation

67
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,380
tomorrow on the battlefield

68
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,510
you have to stay in the middle 
of the formation.

69
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,260
with the rest of our brothers.

70
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,310
Protection from grandsire

71
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,260
will provide security

72
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
for me.

73
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,410
No, friend.

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,380
Protecting you is my responsibility, friend.

75
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,480
All weapons directed at you

76
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,190
will have to go through me first.

77
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,310
Of course, King of Anga,

78
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,310
certainly.

79
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,350
Previously, weapons will only bouncing 
off of your armour

80
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,290
but now they will go through you.

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,350
King of Gandhar!

82
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,220
Do you doubt my competence?
- No, King of Anga!

83
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,360
Now we only have faith on 
your competence

84
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,350
because you gave away your 
divinity as charity.

85
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,250
Is this what you call dedication?!

86
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,280
The truth is

87
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,320
if you really concern with the safety 
of your friend

88
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,320
then you will not risk the life 
of your friend

89
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,220
just to uphold your righteousness

90
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,160
and end up at a loss like this.

91
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,310
My dear.

92
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,150
My dear.

93
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,340
Karna, King of Anga

94
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,380
should be relieved from the task

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,160
of protecting you.

96
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,090
When one can not even protect one's 
own life from enemy's arrows

97
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,110
how can he protect you?

98
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,190
I... 
- Karna, King of Anga

99
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,210
if you like you may leave

100
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,310
this war.

101
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,350
And we hope

102
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,220
that the first arrow of Arjuna

103
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,280
will not end your life.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,120
King of Gandhar!

105
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,190
Now Arjuna's arrows

106
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,210
will be able to hurt the King of Anga.

107
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,280
Because of that

108
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,150
he is prohibited to enter the battlefield.

109
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,050
What do you mean, grandsire?!

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,150
A warrior who has not

111
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,210
pledged his loyalty to his general

112
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,150
can not be

113
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,060
allowed to enter the battlefield.

114
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,110
All my life

115
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,110
I have dreamt to prove my competence 
in the battlefield.

116
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,150
I have gone through difficult trials 
to join this war.

117
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,250
I have taken an oath
to protect my friend.

118
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,310
And it is the purpose of my life.

119
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,090
You do not have the right
to smash my dream

120
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,250
cause this is the only way to prove it.

121
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,110
It's not my responsibilty to let you

122
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,180
proof yourself to the khsatriyas, 
Karna, King of Anga.

123
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,050
Uncle!

124
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,010
No one can stop my friend

125
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,220
to enter the battlefield!

126
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,090
If that's the case

127
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,960
then give

128
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,980
the responsibility to protect you
and the other princes

129
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,210
to the King of Anga

130
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,090
because if he goes to war

131
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,210
then I'm not going to fight.

132
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,220
My dear

133
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,990
Karna, King of Anga

134
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,190
can not even protect himself  
from enemy's arrows,

135
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,060
then how can he protect 
your army?

136
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Uncle!

137
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,920
Do not insult my friend.

138
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,950
Strength lies in attack and how 
to counter it.

139
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,920
Sincerity and protection have no 
strength at all.

140
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,920
My friend's competence

141
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,180
do not require a suit of armor, uncle.

142
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,860
When the time comes

143
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,010
sunlight can change all the water

144
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,080
on the earth to steam, uncle.

145
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,910
Just like my friend's bow

146
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,950
can wipe out the whole enemy, uncle.

147
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Dear

148
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,950
I do not wish to doubt your faith

149
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,910
but if one's beaten on the battlefield

150
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,080
then one's loses one's life!

151
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,020
We can't gamble on the battlefield.

152
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,860
Uncle, I've made my decision!

153
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,990
My friend

154
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,080
will combat on the battlefield tomorrow.

155
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,820
Then listen carefully to my final decision, 
Crown Prince Duryodhana,

156
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,980
Until I lead the army

157
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,020
your friend will not enter 
the battlefield.

158
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,820
If that's your decision, uncle

159
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,080
then listen to mine as well.

160
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:35,020
You should resign your position.

161
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,050
My friend

162
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,790
will be made the next general.

163
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,880
Friend

164
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,850
to show me such respect

165
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
you have made me owe you.

166
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,690
However, in my opinion

167
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,880
you don't have to argue with 
his excellency.

168
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,880
You need him, friend.

169
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,890
I need you more, Karna, my friend.

170
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,820
This is what grandsire wants

171
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,690
to protect the Pandavas.

172
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,690
The truth is

173
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,920
that grandsire and Guru Drona

174
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,790
never want to kill the Pandavas!

175
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,910
It is possible

176
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,730
the Pandavas will only be taken 
captive by them!

177
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,820
And imprisoning those five 
in this war

178
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,720
is not my intention, 
friend Karna.

179
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,780
The very purpose of 
this war is to

180
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,790
kill my enemies, 
friend Karna!

181
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,720
And they will only be killed...

182
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,620
only be killed by you, 
my friend.

183
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,680
The truth is the only one who will strive for 
the sake of my success

184
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,690
is only you.

185
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,690
Let's go friend, before 
making a decision

186
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,650
there's something important 
for you to see.

187
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,690
Listen to them, friend.

188
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,620
There is only one name
in their hearts, friend.

189
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,750
Their dedication until death

190
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,610
and unwavering faith

191
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,660
stem neither because you nor I.

192
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,520
They have come here to 
put their life at stake

193
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,620
simply because His Excellency 
Bhisma is here.

194
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,590
The war will begin when the sun rise 
tomorrow, friend.

195
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,680
And the power of an ordinary soldier

196
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,620
lies not only in his ability

197
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,490
or his courage.
His power rooted in his faith.

198
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,720
A soldier goes forward in the battlefield 
with a faith

199
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,620
that his general would 
protect his life.

200
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,550
And all their faith

201
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,710
rest in His Excellency Bhisma.

202
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm afraid

203
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,580
that if His Excellency Bhishma resigns

204
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,490
then none of them will 
take part in this war.

205
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,420
Not only that, friend.

206
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,520
After His Excellency Bhisma,

207
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,460
you must elect Guru Drona 
as general.

208
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,610
Only after their death

209
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,490
will you to appoint me as general.

210
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,420
But Grandsire Bhisma has a boon 
to die at his will, friend.

211
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,620
How can he be killed?

212
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,450
To protect Hastinapura
and its crown prince

213
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,580
is an oath he took.
Until he dies

214
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,490
the hundred Kauravas will not die.

215
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,390
And you will always be safe, friend.

216
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,550
Let this war proceeds

217
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,590
as His Excellency Bhisma 
wants it to be.

218
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,390
The enemies are bound to 
get hurt in the process.

219
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,520
If he imprisons Pandavas

220
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,450
then you can give them 
a death sentence.

221
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,580
However if he dies

222
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,390
then I will be there

223
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,420
to help you and realize 
your dreams.

224
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,580
But Karna my friend,

225
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,460
killing Arjuna is also your dream.

226
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,390
This has always happened 
to me, friend.

227
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,480
Whenever I get a chance to prove 
my competence,

228
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,390
fate snatches it away from me.

229
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,460
Sometimes, Surya Dev has set it up 
in heaven.

230
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,410
In other times, fate just left me.

231
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,390
To fulfill your dream

232
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,320
I'm willing to sacrifice millions 
of my dreams, friend.

233
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
I will stand outside the battlefield

234
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,520
and waiting for your order.

235
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,410
Obey His Excellency Bhisma's firm order.
