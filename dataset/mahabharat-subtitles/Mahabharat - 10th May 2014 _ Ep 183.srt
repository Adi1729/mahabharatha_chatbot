1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,360
Let me take your leave,
Highness.

2
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,040
Wait, Shakuni.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,760
Wait!

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,240
Actually I'd need you

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,280
to give the right advise
to Duryodhan

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,360
at the right time, Shakuni.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,920
I hereby revoke my order

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,680
for asking you to leave
Gandhar right now. Shakuni!

9
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,960
I'd send my confidante,
Sanjay with a peace treaty

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,240
to Pandavas.
- No, Highness.

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
No.

12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,360
In fact Pandavas need to propose
the peace treaty.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,480
That will make Duryodhan happy.

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,600
Hastinapur's throne

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,960
and you shall redeem
your lost respect.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,800
I hope you don't have a problem

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,800
with this proposal.
- I don't.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,840
I am for peace.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
No matter which way
it comes from.

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,200
Perfect!
Absolutely perfect!

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,040
Then

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,320
their uncle

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,680
that is the Chief Minister,
Vidhur too could aptly

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
escort Sanjay.

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,120
He shall talk to Pandavas
about compassion.

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
Sanjay on the other hand

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,800
would talk to them
about politics.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
Then

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,200
Vasudev Krishna shall be invited

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,560
to Hastinapur

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,560
with Pandava's proposal.

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,120
'Greetings!'

33
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,280
'I greet the warrior
a thousand times.'

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,920
'He feeds me.'

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
'Thanks to him, there's
abundance everywhere.'

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,760
'I greet the Pandavas
a thousand times.'

37
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,440
'He's mighty, magnanimous...'

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,400
'I greet you a thousand times.'

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
'A warfare wizard.'

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,400
'I greet all you citizens.
Greetings!'

41
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,080
'Greetings!
Greetings!'

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,520
'Tomorrow Princess Uttara shall'

43
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,560
'Arjun's son Abhimanyu.'

44
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
'It will be all happy
an festive.'

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
'Singing and dancing.'

46
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
'A lavish feast shall
be organised.'

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,960
'There'll be charity.'

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,400
'How about we welcome
these happy times'

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,640
'with the tale
of an ideal personality?'

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,000
'On this evening,
prior to the wedding'

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
'in order to entertain you all'

52
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,040
'I've been invited to recite
one such tale.'

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,560
'So, people, which tale would
you like to listen to?'

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,200
Shiva's wedding!
- Ram's wedding.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Parashuram's tale.
- 'Calm down!'

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,160
'Why are you screaming?'

57
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,280
'Tell me, Yudhishtir. Which tale
would you like to listen to?'

58
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,000
Not me.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Today Vasudev himself is here.

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,320
Vasudev, which tale would
you like to listen to?

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,640
This lady here

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,960
would decide that.

63
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Tell me. Which tale would
help you calm down?

64
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,360
I am fine now, Govind.
- No.

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,560
You seem fine but you
aren't at peace.

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,200
Brother, may I suggest?

67
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,600
Go aboard.

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,520
Dhundhumali

69
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,920
I would like to listen
to a tale

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,000
that I've heard
during childhood.

71
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,160
I haven't been
able to understand

72
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,560
it's importance until now.

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,680
Neither has my son, Abhmanyu's
been able to understand this

74
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,520
nor my sister's sons.

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,960
'Yes, people!'

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
'There's just one such tale'

77
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,880
'that I can think of.'

78
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,240
'People close to him
have never understood'

79
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,760
'his importance
and his sensibilities.'

80
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,360
'But an ordinary man like me'

81
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,080
'has not just observed him'

82
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
'but understood him as well.'

83
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,920
'No matter how much'

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
'I praise him'

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,120
'I never think it's enough.'

86
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
'The entire Aryan clan
is indebted to him.'

87
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,760
'He has helped
people get rid of agony.'

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
'He looks like a common man'

89
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
'but he's an ascetic.'

90
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
'He looks like a King'

91
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440
'but he's a hermit.'

92
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
'He looks like a warrior'

93
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
'but is magnanimous.'

94
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,680
'He's knowledgeable,
a philosopher and generous'

95
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,840
'yet he is not proud!'

96
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,040
'People, there's just one
such man'

97
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,840
'It isn't a story of Lord Shiva'

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
'or Rama.'

99
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
'It's a tale of Lord Krishna.'

100
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,640
'It's not a warrior tale
of Kailash.'

101
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,720
'Not a tale of land of gold.'

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,200
'A tale about the banks
of the River Yamuna.'

103
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,320
'A tale about the village
Gokul.'

104
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,200
'Ugrasena, the King of Mathura* was held captive'
*Now a city in the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

105
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,680
'by his own son, Kans
and he took over his throne.'

106
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,120
'Kans was the son-in-law of
Magadh King Jarasandha.'

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,360
'He possessed a dark demeanour.'

108
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,440
Stop!

109
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,480
'He was monstrous,
loathsome and sinful.'

110
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,480
'He gave Yadavas a tough time.'

111
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,400
'He troubled his subjects.'

112
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,480
'He had surpassed
all the limits.'

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
'Be it the art deceit,
treachery or betrayal!'

114
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,600
'He had mastered it all.'

115
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,920
You can't cross Mathura gate.

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
What's the trouble,
brother Kans?

117
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
The trouble is Devki.

118
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,080
The lady you're married
to, Vasudev.

119
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,480
Haven't you heard the prophecy

120
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,800
that Devki's eighth son shall
be responsible for my death?

121
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,040
And I shall kill Devki.

122
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,400
Comrade, pull Devki
down the chariot.

123
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,360
Wait.

124
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,560
Kans,

125
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,040
will you kill Devki
for a prophecy?

126
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,440
Vasudev!

127
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,960
Divine prophecies
never go wrong.

128
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
Prophecies are God sent

129
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,640
and they always come true.

130
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
That's a myth.

131
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,280
How can my son kill his uncle?

132
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,400
It's a myth.

133
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,080
I know everything, Devki.

134
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,960
Devak*, Sakroor...
*Devaka was Devaki's father, the younger brother of King Ugrasena of Mathura.

135
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,560
the old Somdutt...

136
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,560
They're all eager to see me die.

137
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
Before accusing us

138
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
take a good look
at yourself first.

139
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
Yadavas aren't your enemy.

140
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,120
You torment your clan
all the time.

141
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,080
You harass your subjects.

142
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,720
You've held your
own father captive.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
An arrogant man

144
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,320
is hated by everyone.

145
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,680
Kans, you'll suffer for sure.

146
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,160
I!

147
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
I'll suffer!

148
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,160
I'll suffer!

149
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,120
I'll suffer.

150
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,080
Who'll make me suffer?

151
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
Who?

152
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
Him!

153
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Him!

154
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,280
Or him!

155
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,700
Remember this!

156
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,260
I am your God.

157
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,660
If anyone goes against me

158
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,020
he shall be beheaded.

159
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,740
Kans, don't be foolish.

160
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,660
Don't forget who I am.

161
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,060
I am Shurasena's son
from Yadava clan.

162
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,380
My sister Briha

163
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,740
is King Kuntibhoj's
adopted daughter.

164
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,860
She's been married to
Hastinapur's ruler, Pandu.

165
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,500
If you harm me

166
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,980
then Pandu, King Shurasena
and Kuntibhoj's army

167
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,620
shall attack you.

168
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,820
You may die today.

169
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,060
Send for everyone.

170
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,500
I'll be killed

171
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,700
by Devki's eighth son

172
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,540
as per the divine prophecy.

173
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
No one else
can cause me any harm.

174
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,460
You can't harm me too.

175
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,420
No one can harm me.

176
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,220
Do you see my soldiers?

177
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,540
They can kill all

178
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,340
the Yadava men right here.

179
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,260
No brother.

180
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,180
Listen to me. It's a myth.

181
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,660
Brother, listen to me.

182
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,940
You'll not be harmed.

183
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,140
Brother, trust me.

184
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,740
Brother!
- Kans, wait!

185
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,380
If the prophecy's right

186
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,860
how will you stop it.

187
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,620
If it's true

188
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,460
what will killing
Devki fetch you.

189
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,820
I am Shurasena's son Vasudev.

190
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,060
If I want I can
kill you right away.

191
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,620
That would bring a stir

192
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,980
among Yadavas.

193
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,820
It won't do good to anyone.

194
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,260
Devki and me are ready
to sacrifice our lives.

195
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,420
We surrender, Kansa.

196
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,220
I promise, Kans

197
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,340
that neither Hastinapur,
nor Kuntibhoj

198
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,460
will make an effort
to rescue us.

199
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,340
I pardon you

200
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,820
and Devki.

201
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,740
My soldiers, arrive now

202
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,540
and put them behind the bars.

203
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,780
Vasudev!

204
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,980
Vasudev!

205
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,860
Here's the infant.

206
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,220
It's time to sacrifice
your child, Devki.
