1
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,360
Govind!

2
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,890
Draupadi.

3
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,030
Draupadi!

4
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,050
Don't touch me,
Queen Mother Kunti.

5
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,860
I'll get besmirched.

6
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,830
I'm no longer
your daughter-in-law.

7
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,990
I'm not your sons' wife.

8
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,030
Neither am I the bride
of the Kuru dynasty.

9
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,890
Dear!

10
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,730
Now, I'm without a husband

11
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,920
a name

12
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,950
or a dynasty.

13
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,990
Just like a flame

14
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,890
burning in the hearth
of a forest dweller far away.

15
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,830
I am pure

16
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,890
but I am thriving
on what is impure.

17
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,760
Today, in this court

18
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,860
I alone have shed tears

19
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,990
equivalent to that of all
the women in this world.

20
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,950
Queen Mother Kunti

21
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,860
Queen Gandhari

22
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,820
if you wish to save yourselves

23
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,700
then renounce
this court and leave.

24
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,700
Because this whole court

25
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,760
will drown today.

26
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,960
I'm not a human being

27
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,890
but death!

28
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,660
Only death!

29
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,660
I'm the death
of all the wicked men

30
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,820
present
in this unrighteous court.

31
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,650
And it's my curse

32
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,620
that right now,
at this very moment...

33
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,660
No, Draupadi!

34
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,750
Please don't curse,
Draupadi.

35
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,630
Forgive them.

36
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,860
Please forgive them.

37
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,800
My curse is forgiveness
in itself, Your Highness.

38
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,860
If I have to punish

39
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,690
then it shall be
in this lifetime.

40
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,690
Every moment,
they'll experience hell.

41
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,820
There will be no end
to their suffering.

42
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
No.

43
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,700
The woman who gives life
can't give death.

44
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,660
These men have almost
committed suicide in this court.

45
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,690
If someone destroys
their physical being

46
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,850
it is called self-annihilation.

47
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,560
But suicide takes place
when they destroy their souls.

48
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,720
Out of rage

49
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
don't do something
similar to these men.

50
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,600
It's a woman's task
to keep the house clean.

51
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,560
And it's a woman's task as well
to keep the society clean.

52
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,630
I curse that...
- Stop, Panchali.

53
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,730
Today, the sons of Pandu
have endured

54
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,550
a great disgrace, Panchali.

55
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,730
Give us a chance
to redeem ourselves.

56
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,630
Let us avenge your dishonour.

57
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,630
How will you take revenge?

58
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,720
You are now the slaves
of these wicked people.

59
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,660
And I no longer
consider you my husband.

60
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,790
Henceforth

61
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,530
I shall never bind my hair.

62
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,690
I shall not wear a tiara
on my head!

63
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,190
Henceforth

64
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,250
I will never tie my hair.

65
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,090
I will not adorn
my forehead with any ornaments.

66
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,080
I accept it.

67
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,250
But only you...

68
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,090
Only you can guard
our souls, Draupadi.

69
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,050
If you don't give us
a chance

70
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,060
to repent for our sins

71
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,030
then till the end of time

72
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,150
we will reside
in the netherworld, Draupadi.

73
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,220
I'm not saying this
as a husband

74
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,180
but as a friend.

75
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,020
Don't lose your patience,
Draupadi.

76
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,120
Don't lose your patience.

77
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,060
'Sometimes the deeds
of others terrify us'

78
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,080
'and give us a chance
to lose our patience.'

79
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,180
'But continue
to be patient.'

80
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,220
'It is very important
to control one's heart.'

81
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,210
Patience?

82
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,150
Patience!

83
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,990
Patience...

84
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,010
My dear...

85
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,960
That's enough, my dear.

86
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,060
King Dhritarashtra

87
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,960
your younger brother,
Pandu's family

88
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,890
has once again done
you a favour.

89
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,090
Go and live happily!

90
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,860
But until you're leading
a content life

91
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,850
keep in mind

92
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
that the day my sons...

93
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,050
The day my sons
attain freedom

94
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,030
will be the last day
of your happiness.

95
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,860
Your sons will
attain freedom?

96
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,860
Keep quiet, my dear.

97
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,850
Keep quiet.

98
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,950
Let him speak, Shakuni.

99
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,920
This is his arrogance speaking!

100
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,120
You wanted to disrobe Draupadi,
isn't it, Duryodhan?

101
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,820
Look!
Look around this court!

102
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,020
Even the skin of a poisonous
snake

103
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,030
deserts it.

104
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,920
All those who quietly
witnessed this unrighteous act...

105
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,020
Look at how they have been
disrobed

106
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,890
like a snake!

107
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,920
Look around this court!

108
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,860
Listen carefully, Duryodhan

109
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,810
I will soon go to Dwarka

110
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,850
and bring Krishna's
Narayani army to Hastinapur.

111
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,020
And I will request
Krishna and Balrama

112
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,950
to defeat
the Kuru dynasty!

113
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,860
Help my sons gain freedom!

114
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,820
But not to kill any of you

115
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,850
because the responsibility
of taking revenge

116
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,920
for my daughter-in-law's
humiliation

117
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,920
lies only with my sons.

118
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,750
And this task

119
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,990
will be done
only by my sons.

120
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,280
No, Kunti.
No.

121
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
No, Kunti.

122
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,450
Don't give us such
a severe punishment.

123
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
If the Kuru dynasty is
destroyed

124
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
at my hands

125
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,520
then the souls of my ancestors
will never rest in peace.

126
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,250
No.

127
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,250
I seek your forgiveness

128
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,420
Draupadi.

129
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,290
You can ask for any wish
you want.

130
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,220
Yes.

131
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,380
But forgive my sons.

132
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
If it's possible for you

133
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,210
erase the memories
of today's game.

134
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,360
Nothing else
can subside my pain.

135
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,320
The stain on our characters
will never be erased, my dear.

136
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,450
But so that our sadness
decreases to some extent

137
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,390
ask for a wish, my dear.

138
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
Do His Highness a favour.

139
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,380
Ask for a wish.

140
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,440
Ask, my dear.

141
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,290
Give the Pandavas
their freedom.

142
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,190
Return their weapons.

143
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,380
Their powers had been
snatched through treachery

144
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,180
in this court.

145
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,160
Return their powers to them.
