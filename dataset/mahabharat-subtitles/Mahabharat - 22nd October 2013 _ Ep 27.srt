1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,930
My son.

2
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,880
All of us have waited for you
for a long time.

3
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,770
Your father will
be very pleased.

4
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,940
I'll inform him right now.
Lord!

5
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,810
Lord!

6
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,660
Kripacharya

7
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,640
what do these omens portend?

8
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,610
There's darkness everywhere.

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,640
Blood chilling screams
can be heard.

10
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,840
What... What kind of a bad omen
is this, Kripacharya?

11
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,680
Whenever a human being
with evil tendency takes birth

12
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,840
the entire universe feeIs it.

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
The entire universe
conveys its reaction

14
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
through such bad omens,
Your Highness.

15
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
In fact, the entire universe
warns of the troubles

16
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,680
we would face in the future.

17
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,640
Amidst all these bad omens

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,800
the first child is taking birth.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
This child has taken birth

20
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,610
as a threat to Hastinapur.

21
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,730
Are you trying to say that
my son is a demon and is evil?

22
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,730
This is what's written in
the scriptures, Your Highness.

23
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,770
Kids who are a menace
to society are born

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,670
in this world every day.

25
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,700
If the scriptures were right

26
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,570
such an atmosphere would
persist forever

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,540
isn't it, Kripacharya?

28
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,670
This is no small crisis,
Shakuni.

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,640
It would be catastrophic.

30
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,680
Not just for the Kuru clan.

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,540
Not just for Hastinapur
and Kurukshetra

32
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,580
but for the entire
Arya empire.

33
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,680
For the well-being of oneself
and for the welfare of the state

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,580
the scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.

35
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,680
This child is a
threat for sure.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,640
He is a threat, but to whom?

37
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,680
Is this a bad omen
for the entire state

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,730
or for an individual?

39
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,640
Is this a disaster for
the one

40
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,700
who didn't allow His Highness
to be crowned?

41
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,470
The child His Highness had
been waiting for

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,740
how can you even suggest that
the child be killed?

43
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,700
Whether Her Highness
has 100 sons or 99

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,480
it won't harm the state much.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,670
But if this child remains alive

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,470
it would be devastating

47
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,700
for the entire state
and the entire clan.

48
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,700
I am not in favour of killing
my sister's son, Kripacharya.

49
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,640
Bheeshma, what's your opinion?

50
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,440
The thought of snatching
the right to live, from a child

51
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,570
pains me, Queen mother.

52
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,670
If it's in the interest
of the state

53
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,610
a sacrifice cannot be termed
inappropriate, Sire.

54
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,570
I believe

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,670
this decision should be made by

56
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,510
the one who is a king
and a father.

57
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,580
On the basis of dreams
and intuitions

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,640
we imagine the joy and
sorrow of the future.

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,510
To eliminate the cause of
our sorrow in the future

60
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
we make plans today.

61
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,400
But by eliminating the troubles
of the future, right now

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
do we gain or lose?

63
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,540
We never ask this question.

64
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,600
The truth is

65
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,410
the problem and its solution
evolve together

66
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,470
for a human being
and for nature as well.

67
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,340
Isn't it?
Think about your past.

68
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,600
Look at history.

69
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,370
You will realise immediately

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,540
whenever there's trouble

71
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,310
the solution comes
into existence simultaneously.

72
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,570
This is how the world works.

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,500
Thus, a crisis is the reason
for the birth of a power.

74
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,540
Whenever a person
gets out of a crisis

75
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,410
he has taken a step ahead
and shines more.

76
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,310
He's full of confidence,
not just for himself

77
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,410
but for the world too.

78
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,400
Isn't that true?

79
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,480
Actually, the birth of a crisis
is the birth of an opportunity

80
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,310
to change oneself

81
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,410
and to develop one's thoughts

82
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,440
to strengthen one's soul
and enlighten it with wisdom.

83
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,480
The one who is able to do so
doesn't face any crisis

84
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,480
but the one who is unable
to do so

85
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,500
is a menace for the world.

86
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,470
Think about it.

87
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,230
'This child has taken birth
as a threat to Hastinapur.'

88
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,430
'The scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.'

89
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,170
'This decision should be
made by the one'

90
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
'who is a king and a father.'

91
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,370
'This child has taken birth
as a threat to Hastinapur.'

92
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,340
'The scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.'

93
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
'The scriptures ordain that such
a cursed child be sacrificed.'

94
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,330
'This decision should be
made by the one'

95
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,140
'who is a king and a father.'

96
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,000
Mother!

97
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,140
Can my son see me?

98
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,990
Can he see his father?

99
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,990
Yes, my son.

100
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,200
Seeing you has brought
a smile on his face.

101
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,090
My son...

102
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,970
My heir

103
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,100
will be invincible in
this world, mother.

104
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,070
It would be impossible
to fight and defeat him.

105
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,930
My son will be called

106
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,170
Duryodhan!*
*"Unconquerable one".

107
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,870
I am pleased
by your prayers, Kunti.

108
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,100
On Sage Durvasa's command

109
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,990
I've come to bless you
with a son.

110
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
I am very grateful to you,
Lord Indra.

111
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,960
The way
you are the greatest demigod

112
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,960
similarly, I want my son
to be the greatest human being.

113
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,990
Your wish
will be fulfilled, Kunti.

114
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,000
Your son will be renowned
among humankind.

115
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,800
The way I am the basis of
heaven's potential

116
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,800
similarly, your son will be
the basis of Earth's potential.

117
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,770
He will be
physically very strong.

118
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
He will be the most determined.

119
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,960
His heart will melt
at human misery.

120
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,960
He will be very soft-hearted
And due to his kind-heart

121
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,940
that is, his generosity

122
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,970
the whole world

123
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,930
will know him as Arjun.*
*"Shining or famous like silver."

124
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,890
Madri...

125
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,860
Why are you shedding tears?

126
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,770
I had gone to the forest
to collect wood, Kunti.

127
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,960
There I saw a family
of monkeys.

128
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,770
The old monkey

129
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,930
was having a jovial time
with his wife and kids.

130
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,870
There were all so happy
and at peace.

131
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,690
All their faces reflected
hopes of the arrival of spring.

132
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,760
When I saw them
I became emotional.

133
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,900
Did you get emotional on
seeing them happy, Madri?

134
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,830
No, Sister.

135
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,930
But there I saw

136
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,890
and old female monkey,
away from the entire family

137
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
sitting on a branch
all by herself.

138
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,790
She neither had food

139
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,890
nor the warmth of
the family.

140
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,820
Alone

141
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,730
helpless

142
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,630
and miserable.

143
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,860
She would have once been a
part of this happy family.

144
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,830
But she wouldn't have been
able to bear children.

145
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,860
Hence she has been
forgotten.

146
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,830
She is awaiting her death.

147
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,740
Don't you have faith

148
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,730
on these three sons, Madri?

149
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,860
No, Sister.

150
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,830
A new born child has no
preconceived notions.

151
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,860
How can I distrust them?

152
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,590
But when rain water
falls into the sea

153
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,700
it turns bitter too.

154
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,630
Your three sons will definitely
make my condition

155
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,670
like that of the
old female monkey.

156
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,770
Madri

157
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,760
don't say such things
on this auspicious occasion.

158
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,600
This occasion might be
auspicious for you!

159
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Spring hasn't come as
spring for me

160
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,570
but as winter which will
freeze all my desires.

161
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,640
Today your wish has
come true, Sister.

162
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,560
You have defeated me with
the power of your mantras.

163
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,640
You have also made the king
do injustice to me.

164
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,730
I am not as crafty as you.

165
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,700
But remember one thing, Sister...

166
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,670
As you sow so shall you reap.

167
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,530
The one doing injustice has
to carry its burden with him

168
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,800
for his entire life.

169
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,020
Son, the five main parts
of a temple are

170
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,860
The gate pyramids,
the innermost sanctum

171
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,830
The pillars, the canopy

172
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,850
And the spire.

173
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,850
In the same way, a kingdom
is also divided into five parts

174
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,090
The council of ministers
is the canopy of the state...

175
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,020
The citizens are its pyramids.

176
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:10,920
The army its pillars.

177
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,050
The seat of justice is the
sanctum sanctorum.

178
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,990
And the throne is it's spire.

179
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,060
The Lord's idol is placed
in the sanctum sanctorum.

180
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,990
And a nation's glory
lies in

181
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,030
its seat of justice.

182
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,050
Will you remember this?

183
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,930
Then you will definitely be
the greatest king.

184
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,950
In order to become
Emperor Dhritrashta's heir

185
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,760
you have to work very hard,
Yudhishthir.

186
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Won't you work hard?

187
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
I am content today, my son.

188
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,830
Your 104 younger brothers
will spread your glory

189
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,860
worldwide.

190
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
My lord...

191
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,920
It is time for the birth of

192
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,020
Yudhishthir's two
younger brothers.

193
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,830
I had the same thought, Kunti.

194
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,830
This time we have to

195
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,950
get the divine sacrament
of the

196
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,860
Ashwinis
the physicians of the Gods.

197
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,760
When Yudhishtir becomes
the king

198
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,850
it's important that his brothers
have the knowledge of health.

199
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,860
Humans, cows

200
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,850
horses, elephants
and other animals.

201
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
The ability and knowledge
to understand them

202
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,890
can be given only by
the Ashwinis.

203
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,760
Invite the Ashwinis, Kunti.

204
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
Yes, your highness.

205
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,920
But this time
I won't recite the mantra

206
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,720
Madri will.

207
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,890
My lord

208
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,960
even Madri has the right
to bear your children.

209
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,830
You have received
this boon, Kunti.

210
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
It is the reward
for your efforts.

211
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,830
Whether there's a crisis
in the family

212
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,750
or accomplishments

213
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,920
everyone has the right
on the proceeds.

214
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,860
If we want to teach this
truth to our children

215
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,750
then first

216
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,860
I will have to learn
to accept this truth.

217
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,860
I will teach Madri
the mantra

218
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,860
with all my heart.

219
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,690
And the mantra

220
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,850
will definitely bear fruit,
my lord.
