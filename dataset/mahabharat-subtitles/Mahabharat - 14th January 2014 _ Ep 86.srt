1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,620
You are very beautiful.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
More beautiful than
this doll of mine.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,380
I shall have her married to
a good and handsome Prince.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,420
And you should marry a
handsome Prince too, Princess.

5
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,410
Nakul

6
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,420
in which direction
should we proceed?

7
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,410
There is a very thick forest
towards the South, brother.

8
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,350
Some birds are flying
from the West.

9
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,480
They seem to have
found some wheat.

10
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,380
Hence, there must be villages
and fields in that direction.

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,550
We should proceed
in that direction then.

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,380
Let's go.

13
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,520
Mother

14
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,310
brother Yudhishthir

15
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,380
there is a village nearby.

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,480
We may live there for a while.

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,450
But would it be right
to go to a village, Arjun?

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,220
What will happen
if someone recognizes us?

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,510
We are outside the borders
of the Kuru kingdom, Bheem.

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,410
This is the kingdom of Ahichhatra.*
*The ancient capital of Northern Panchala, near Ramnagar village in Uttar Pradesh state.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,410
Apart from guru Drona
and Ashwatthama

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,510
who else can recognize us here?

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,460
Sages, we shall offer you
security till the next village.

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,450
Bless you!

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,190
This way, please.

26
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,120
Stop, sages.

27
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,180
Greetings.
- Bless you.

28
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,980
You have no protector
or weapons with you.

29
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,960
Where are the five of you
headed towards?

30
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,050
We are not five.
We have...

31
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,990
We were...
- This is my land

32
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,120
and it is my duty
to protect all of you.

33
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,120
Let's go.

34
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,980
Let me drop all of you
to the next village safely.

35
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,020
This way, please.

36
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,920
But there were
six more people with us.

37
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,080
Five young men and their mother.

38
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,890
We must wait for them.

39
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,080
Five young men and their mother?

40
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,790
Where?

41
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,790
Where are they?

42
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,820
We have to kill him now.

43
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,050
Brother Bheem

44
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,860
mother has ordered us
to stay in hiding.

45
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,980
Besides, we cannot kill
the son of our teacher.

46
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,950
We need to proceed
towards the forest.

47
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,030
Soldiers, look for
those six people!

48
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,210
Where did they go?!

49
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,200
Look for them!

50
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,910
Let's go.

51
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,140
Soldiers, those people
must be trying to hide.

52
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And to look for a person
who is hiding

53
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,940
is the prime duty of a King.

54
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,040
Look for them.

55
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,870
Brother Yudhishthir

56
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,870
proceed to the forest
with mother.

57
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,810
Until all of you
make it to the forest

58
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,840
I shall stay here to keep
an eye on Ashwatthama.

59
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,970
Nakul, Sahadev, make haste.

60
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,770
Arjun, be careful.

61
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Let's go, mother.
Let's go, Bheem.

62
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,480
Soldier, what are you
waiting for?!

63
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,420
Go after them! - We cannot
go beyond this, Your Highness.

64
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,310
That is the forest
of the ogre, Hidimb.

65
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,350
A person who enters it
does not come out alive.

66
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,350
But those people
have entered it.

67
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,310
Maybe they do not know,
Your Highness

68
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,320
that even sunlight does not
penetrate this illusory forest.

69
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,540
They are bound to become
Hidimb's meal, Your Highness.

70
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,410
But it is vital to know

71
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,410
why they were
hiding in this manner.

72
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
Who were those six people?

73
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,350
Arjun

74
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,480
are you alright?

75
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,350
Sahadev, that way.

76
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,510
Brother, we are back to
where we started from.

77
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,440
How odd!

78
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,240
Sunlight does not penetrate
this place even during the day.

79
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,270
I think, Ashwatthama
must have left by now.

80
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,270
Now, we should leave
this forest as well.

81
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,210
How odd!

82
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,270
I had ripped a tree out
to clear the path.

83
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,410
But did I

84
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,150
rip a tree out from here
or from somewhere else?

85
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,250
From where did we
enter this forest?

86
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,140
Mother, this way.

87
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,220
Brother Bheem,
we should rest for a while.

88
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,240
Mother must also be tired.

89
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,280
But would it not be safer for us
to leave this forest first?

90
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,140
Would resting here be right,
Yudhishthir?

91
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,040
We can certainly
rest here, mother.

92
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,010
After entering this forest

93
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,080
leaving this place
or resting here

94
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,460
makes no difference.

95
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,150
Besides, now we

96
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,240
cannot leave this forest.

97
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,050
What do you mean?

98
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,110
This is an illusory forest,
Nakul.

99
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,050
Illusory.

100
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,210
Illusory?
