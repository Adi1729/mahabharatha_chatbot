1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,120
You will sit right here
and mourn, sire.

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,890
My conscience curses you!

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,460
A curse!

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,930
N-No...
No, Vidura.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,500
No, Vidura.

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,940
Vidura...
Vidura...

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Gandhari.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,680
G-Gandhari...

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,250
Gandhari!
G-Gandhari!

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,830
Gandhari...

11
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,370
Mother!

12
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,830
I have turned old.

13
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:34,660
In one day it feels like I have borne
a decade long pain and turned old.

14
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,540
Mother

15
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,550
all of us feel
burdened today.

16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,760
What kind of a strange
situation this is, mother?

17
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,330
We knew the consequences

18
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,310
for which grandsire himself
has prepared us.

19
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,690
But when we were faced
with that situation

20
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,350
the head was unable
to bear it, mother.

21
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,490
You're right, son.

22
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,200
The very thought of pain
scares a person.

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,810
But the experience

24
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,110
crushes his head.

25
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,480
Like every part of you
is experiencing pain.

26
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,290
One can overcome fear
through determination

27
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,070
but he cannot get rid
of the pain, son.

28
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,300
Mother-in-law

29
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,370
duty always causes pain.

30
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,680
That's why people try to escape
from performing their duties.

31
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,590
This battle is our duty.

32
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,390
All those who die
in this battle...

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,290
We'll mourn their deaths
together

34
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,730
once the battle ends

35
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,700
for the rest of our lives.

36
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,210
But now

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,150
is not the time to mourn,
mother-in-law.

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,220
Panchali is right, mother.

39
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,250
If a warrior

40
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,330
mourns his troubles all night

41
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,200
then the next day
at the battlefield

42
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,190
he does not have
the courage to even stand.

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,700
And the battle is not over yet.

44
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,250
We have to focus on our strategy
for tomorrow.

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,450
So that our patience
is not shattered

46
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,690
grandsire is still
holding on to his breath.

47
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,140
We will serve grandsire
continuously.

48
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,640
We will take care of his needs
day and night.

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,470
Turn by turn, each of us
will serve grandsire.

50
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,550
Panchali

51
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,880
give me food and water
for grandsire.

52
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,650
I will serve him today.

53
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,570
Grandsire, I have brought
some medicines for you.

54
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,400
Some food and water too.

55
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,610
Please have them.

56
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,110
Son Arjun

57
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,810
what benefit can
this body of mine gain

58
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,320
from food, medicines,
water, et cetera?

59
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,500
But, grandsire, if your
pain is reduced

60
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,660
only then will the pain
in our heads reduce.

61
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,660
You may have ordered us
to go fight the battle

62
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,810
but if you're going to be
in this state

63
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,450
then how will we get
the strength to fight?

64
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,180
How will we be able
to fight?

65
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,820
Do us a favour,
grandsire.

66
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,350
Answer a question of mine.

67
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
Can a person

68
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,230
remain disease free
with medicines?

69
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,170
No, grandsire.

70
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,340
The body heaIs itself.

71
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,740
Medicines only lend support

72
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,280
You are right, Arjun.

73
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,220
This body of mine also

74
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,830
does not need these
medicines any more.

75
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,160
My body does not
want to heal.

76
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,500
Until 'Uttarayana'*
*"Uttara" (North) and "ayana" (movement), the northward movement of the Sun on the celestial sphere, between January 14 and July 16.

77
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,810
I will hold on
to this body

78
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,580
I don't need anything more
than this, Arjun.

79
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,050
Have some water at least.

80
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,070
I am the son of Ganga.

81
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,570
This water will not be able
to quench my thirst, son.

82
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,400
Every part of me

83
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,680
desires for the water

84
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,210
in which my body
is destined to be immersed.

85
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,420
You have the strength

86
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,790
to unite

87
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,190
my mother and I, son.

88
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,100
But

89
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,420
this battlefield of Kurukshetra
has turned harsh

90
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,770
because of the blood
it drank.

91
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,610
And harshness, be it
of the land or of the head

92
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,580
doesn't have place for purity.

93
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,580
Make enough place in this land

94
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,120
so that my mother
can get in, son.

95
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,460
Please do so, dear.

96
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,360
That is more than enough for me.

97
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,180
Forgive me, mother.

98
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,470
Today

99
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,780
I will not be
able to

100
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,340
stand to bow down
in your respect.

101
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,090
A father feels delighted
with such respect, son.

102
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,060
A mother feels real
happiness only

103
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,140
when her child places his head
on her lap.

104
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,200
Son of Pandu, Arjun

105
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,410
I will reside here
from now on

106
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,750
and take care of my son.

107
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
You're free of this
responsibility, dear.

108
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,670
Don't feel sad
because of his agony.

109
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,310
Fortunate are those

110
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,130
who in old age

111
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,380
get an opportunity
to be a child once more.

112
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,070
Go

113
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,760
and carry out your duties.

114
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,570
May you prosper.

115
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,740
Though I am your son

116
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,750
I have committed grave crimes.

117
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,340
The ones

118
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,350
whose welfare was my priority

119
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,660
were also welled up with tears

120
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,450
due to me.

121
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,430
Why so, mother?

122
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,060
Son.

123
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,470
You are able to distinguish
what is righteous

124
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,270
just as the rays of the Sun.

125
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,010
Hence, the ones
who cannot see righteousness

126
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,810
cannot have their minds
read by you.

127
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,690
You have been hard
on yourself your whole life, son.

128
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,680
Any person who is hard
on himself

129
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,360
cannot behave tenderly
towards others, son.

130
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,590
You were never bound
to attachments.

131
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,660
Hence the ones
blinded by attachments

132
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,500
were only punished, by you.

133
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,440
You haven't taught them
a lesson.

134
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,340
Yes, mother.

135
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,620
If I had been able to accept
others' weaknesses

136
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,760
then perhaps I would have
found a solution for it.

137
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,030
This is my error.

138
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,230
It is not your fault, son.

139
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,890
Instead, it is my fault.

140
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,260
I have not passed down

141
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,770
any unholiness or weakness
to you.

142
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,540
To know others' weaknesses

143
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,740
it is necessary for

144
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,980
some weakness to exist
in oneself.

145
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,390
Only the one who battles
with his weakness

146
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,800
can impart knowledge
about it.

147
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,770
You are the epitome of purity
in this world, mother.

148
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,810
Then how

149
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,640
did this son of yours

150
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,910
turn into an unholy person?

151
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,840
How so, mother?

152
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,320
You are not unholy, Devavrata.

153
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,220
You have lived as the epitome
of holiness, my son.

154
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,530
Then why

155
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,260
do I not receive salvation,
mother?

156
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,600
I am here for that
very purpose, son.

157
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,610
Your tasks in life that

158
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,300
you have considered as
your virtues

159
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,280
and all that you have considered
as your sins

160
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,720
need to be renunciated, my dear.

161
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,750
Let those toils be washed away

162
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,460
with these droplets of blood
from your body.

163
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,950
Become the epitome
of knowledge, my son.

164
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,020
When a person capable enough

165
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,060
comes to you for that knowledge

166
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,830
then renunciate even that.

167
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,000
At that moment I shall
engulf you in my tides.

168
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,840
Till that moment

169
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,910
I shall stay near you, son.

170
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,550
Subsequent to your death
on earth

171
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,660
I shall wait for
the time of your rebirth

172
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,300
in the Heavens, son.

173
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,650
Today

174
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,290
the thirst of my life
has subsided, mother.

175
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,530
It is now quenched.

176
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,850
Oh, great warriors!

177
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,920
Grandsire Bhishma's defeat

178
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,460
is no reason for us
to be frustrated.

179
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,960
The Pandavas
have not defeated him.

180
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,870
Due to his oath

181
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,010
he gave up his weapons.

182
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,230
Neither has this

183
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,470
added to the valour
of our adversaries

184
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,940
nor has it increased
their chances of victory.

185
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,750
Do not forget, my great warriors

186
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,920
that in eight directions

187
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,260
eight gigantic elephants

188
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,530
jointly bear the weight
of the sky.

189
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,070
They are called legends.

190
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,240
The fall of one legend

191
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,240
would not let the sky collapse.

192
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,150
Grandsire Bhishma was
certainly a great warrior.

193
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,870
But we do possess

194
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,730
other undefeated warriors
as him.

195
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,740
It is hard for even Lord Indra
to retribute to his arrows.

196
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,620
He has immense power

197
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,630
and owns divine weapons.

198
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,260
Similar to Grandsire Bhishma

199
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,840
he is also the disciple
of Lord Parashuram.

200
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,540
Oh, great warriors!

201
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,450
Going forward,
in the battle-field

202
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,850
you shall be lead
by your commander-in-chief.

203
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,970
Disciple of Lord Parashuram

204
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,770
and a great warrior

205
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,570
Karna, the king of Anga.

206
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,020
Oh, great Karna!

207
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,260
The time to demonstrate
your valour has come.

208
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,670
Dear friend, Karna.

209
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,770
I have complete faith in you.

210
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,110
You do not have any reason
to be biased

211
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,480
towards the Pandavas.

212
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,570
Neither are you related
to the Pandavas

213
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,910
nor are they your disciples.

214
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,580
Dear, Karna.

215
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,560
You and only you

216
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,430
shall annihilate those Pandavas.
