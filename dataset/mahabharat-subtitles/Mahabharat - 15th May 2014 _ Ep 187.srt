Everyone in this world is
born with relevant powers.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,180
But fear, endearment
and desire are reasons

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,950
that prevent the human
race from making an effort.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,990
Those who don't try can
never succeed, my dear.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,960
But your life could have
been put at risk.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,080
My dear, life is always at risk.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,110
Whenever an attempt is made

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,960
the chances of success
and failure

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,120
are divided in equal proportions

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,050
but if there is no attempt
the chances of failure

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,950
become a certainty.

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,980
Remember this my children

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,880
standing up against someone's
atrocities and injustice

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,020

only one kind of harm...

15
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,920
At worst, you may die.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,890
But to decide against
making an attempt

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,110
out of fear or endearment

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,090

certain kinds of harms.

19
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,050
Our soul succumbs

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,920
and the tyrants grow
fonder of injustice.

Yadavs become prosperous again.

Prince Abhimanyu,
despite being his elder

I bow down in respect to the
greatest of the Yadavs, Krishna.

26
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:05,090
Because he has taught all
of us the music of life.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,980
He has made
our lives prosperous.

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,820
Not only with money but
he has also left us richer

delighted in the forests.

33

laughter, happiness

34

can afford to donate 100 cows,
hermits.

43
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,690
That's not acceptable, Nand.
You'll have to donate 1000 cows.

44
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,750
Along with that, you will have
to donate wealth, grains, gold

Nand, are you not aware
of Lord Indra's wrath?

47
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,880
The land on which you
reside is Lord Indra's region.

48
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,690
If you go against Lord Indra,
you are bound to suffer.

The entire society contributes
to Lord Indra's yajna.

You are not an exception.

When you went against
a less important king

52

you were exiled from Gokul

if the Lord of Lords
is upset with you

54

where on earth
will you find refuge?

55
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,550
But how can we donate
all that we have earned

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,810
after an entire
year's struggle, sire.

57
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,650
When Lord Indra killed Vritasur* and saved the human race
*A serpent or dragon, the personification of drought.

58
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,660
humans decided to show
support by worshipping him.

59
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,550
But Vritasur had attacked
the heavens.

60
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,780
Lord Indra had killed
Vritasur to protect himself

61
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,710
and not the humans.

62

You are an imbecile young man.

You are yet to witness
Lord Indra's wrath.

64
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,760
Hermit, are you saying that we
perform the yajna out of fear?

65
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,590
But fear takes away
from a human's soul.

66
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,550
Only when the devotion
is spurred by love

67
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,680
can the human soul
be prosperous.

68
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,560
What kind of devotion
deprives a man of his wealth?

69
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,650
Young man, your arguments
are pointless.

70

Lord Indra's yajna will
have to be performed

71
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,520
and it surely calls
for donation.

72
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,680
The yajna will begin
on the full moon night

of the month of asaadh.*
*June-July.

we'll have to abide by
the traditions.

The world is not run by
young and pointless thoughts.

But father, the only one
who forms the basis of life

Why should we worship

83
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,590
What would you suggest, Krishna?

84
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,510
Father, we should
worship the Govardhan hill

85
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,680
which gives life to our cows.

86
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,680
We will surely hold Lord
Indra's yajna but only when

87
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,580
it is done with affection
and respect.

Also, bring new offerings
