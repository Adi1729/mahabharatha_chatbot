1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,540
Prince Arjun.

2
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
Govind was correct.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,750
Mahadev always gives
a definite answer.

4
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,770
In the 'swayamvar,'
that competition

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,610
shall await you.

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,610
This 'swayamvar' is only
for 'Kshatriya' Kings, Nakul.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,680
We have disguised as 'Brahmins.'

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,720
No one will await us there.

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,710
We must follow mother's orders

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,610
and leave for Naimisharanya
tonight itself.

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,750
You shall indeed come
to the 'swayamvar,' Prince.

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,740
I have firm faith in it.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,750
That is why, Govind had said

14
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,640
that fate does not
require an invitation.

15
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,510
Listen all!

16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,450
The Crown Prince
of Vidarbha, Rukmi

17
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,540
is making his entrance!

18
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,550
Listen all!

19
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,450
The Crown Prince of Hastinapur

20
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,470
the son of King Dhritarashtra

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,450
Duryodhan, is making
his entrance!

22
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,570
Listen all!

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,470
King Karna of Anga
is making his entrance!

24
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,510
Listen all!

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,610
The King of Gandhar,
esteemed Brahmin

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,420
Pratipal Shakuni
is making his entrance!

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,670
Listen all!

28
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,450
The Prince of Hastinapur,
Dusshasan

29
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,540
is making his entrance!

30
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,470
The arrangements look splendid,
King of Gandhar.

31
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,370
And the place has also
been adorned beautifully.

32
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,280
What happens when spring

33
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,480
graces a desert, King of Anga?

34
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,370
One gets to see mirages then.

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,380
You still deem Panchal an enemy,
King of Gandhar.

36
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,350
But if an enemy is praiseworthy

37
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,510
brave men praise such an enemy.

38
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,440
You deem bravery to be victory.

39
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,350
I deem victory to be bravery,
King of Anga.

40
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,410
The benevolence
to praise the enemy

41
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,440
does not reside in me.

42
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,280
But guru Drona has befriended

43
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,350
the King of Panchal, uncle.

44
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,510
Now, the King of Panchal
is our friend.

45
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,210
Until proven one's enemy

46
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,440
one who deems
everyone his friends

47
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,280
is a fool.

48
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,440
And until proven one's friend

49
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,340
one who deems
everyone his enemies

50
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,180
is intelligent, my dear!

51
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,470
Drupad is still our enemy.

52
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,370
If he is intelligent

53
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,350
and wishes to
befriend Hastinapur

54
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,250
then he will have
his daughter married

55
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,350
only to my Duryodhan.

56
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,310
Draupadi

57
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,370
Guru Mother is here to have
your hair tied ritualistically.

58
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,150
Why is there a ritual
to tie the hair?

59
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,410
Princess

60
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,310
after marriage women do not
leave their hair open.

61
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,250
Only women who have
lost their husbands

62
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,180
leave their hair open.

63
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,320
I shall tie your hair after
applying this special oil.

64
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,120
Then your husband will
put a hair ornament on it.

65
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,180
Pray for me.

66
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,250
Pray for such a person
to win the 'swayamvar'

67
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,110
whose face would leave
the heart feeling ecstatic.

68
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,650
This place is empty, mother.

69
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,810
And it is also safe.

70
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,910
Son, are we far from Kampilya?

71
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,820
Yes, mother.
Very far.

72
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,810
Do go inside and rest.

73
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,720
We shall then proceed
towards Naimisharanya.

74
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,850
We shall not be able to rest
properly for days then.

75
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,920
And we may also not get
a proper meal for days.

76
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,720
Between this place
and Naimisharanya

77
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,780
is there not a big village
or city, brother Yudhishthir?

78
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,840
No, Bheem.

79
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,710
We must ask for alms
from a nearby village.

80
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,860
You and Nakul
must stay with mother.

81
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,720
The three of us
will get the alms.

82
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,710
No.

83
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,780
If the five of you go together

84
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,690
then you will be able
to get the alms sooner.

85
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,880
But mother

86
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,850
you will be alone here.

87
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,750
What should I fear, son?

88
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,810
I shall close the door.

89
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,780
I shall complete an undertaking
I had made a resolution for.

90
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,780
All of you should go now

91
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,790
but return soon.

92
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,690
Goodbye, mother.

93
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,580
In which direction should we
proceed, brother Yudhishthir?

94
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,790
Kampilya lies
towards North, Arjun.

95
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,820
We cannot proceed that way.

96
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,810
We should proceed
in this direction.

97
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,590
There must be a village
this way.

98
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,690
But will anyone be here?

99
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,520
What if everyone has gone
to see the 'swayamvar?'

100
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,690
Why would everyone go
to see the 'swayamvar?'

101
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,690
I've heard, the King of Panchal
has organized a grand event.

102
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,620
And whoever goes there today

103
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,750
will be given
gold coins in charity.

104
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,720
Such an announcement
was also made by him.

105
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,520
And the subjects also wish
to see their Princess, brother.

106
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,680
I have heard that the
Princess is so beautiful

107
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,750
that upon seeing her,
one forgets one's woes.

108
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,560
Many Princes would
have gone there then

109
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,520
with the hope
to forget their woes.

110
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,450
All hail King Drupad!

111
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,550
All hail King Drupad!

112
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,550
All hail King Drupad!

113
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,710
All hail King Drupad!

114
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,450
All hail King Drupad!

115
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,550
All hail King Drupad!

116
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,680
All hail King Drupad!

117
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,550
Bless you all!

118
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,680
I welcome all the Kings
and Princes present here.

119
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,450
All of you must know

120
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,620
that the whole
of the Aryan region

121
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,720
was given a divine present
by the Gods.

122
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,520
From the sacrificial fire

123
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,590
a daughter as pure and radiant

124
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,490
as fire and bearing
divine beauty

125
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,450
was created.

126
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,650
She is like a flag at
the pinnacle of a temple

127
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,390
or at the zenith of a palace!

128
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,510
Similarly, to have my daughter

129
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,680
the Princess of Panchal,
Draupadi

130
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,450
as his wife would be the fortune

131
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,650
of only the most competent
person on the planet!

132
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,390
I ask the 'Kshatriya'
Kings and

133
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,550
Princes present

134
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,650
to have their competence tested

135
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,440
by coming forth!

136
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,610
Crown Prince Dhrishtadyumna

137
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
shall elaborate upon
the competition.

138
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,360
I welcome the guests
present here!

139
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,360
Such a device has
been set up here

140
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,580
which cannot be conquered
by an ordinary warrior.

141
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,430
This divine bow

142
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,540
can be lifted only by a person

143
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,340
who has nothing but confidence

144
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,340
in his competence.

145
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,270
If the shadow of doubt
creeps up on someone

146
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,340
then for him,
the weight of this bow

147
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,470
will be more than
that of a mountain.

148
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,240
This bow can be stringed
only by a person

149
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,310
who can free himself
of desire, anger and greed

150
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,240
and knows how to bear it.

151
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,470
To him, art should not be
a medium to obtain anything

152
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,330
but an opportunity to
further learn various arts.

153
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,110
Kings and Princes present here

154
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,140
do you see that fish
revolving in the sky?

155
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,370
Its eye is your goal.

156
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,270
'The fish shown here was made
using computer graphics.'

157
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,140
By looking at its reflection
in the water

158
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,330
the archer needs to
pierce its eye

159
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,140
with

160
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,300
only one arrow.

161
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
And the person
who wins this competition

162
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,270
will be married
to my beloved sister.

163
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,040
My dear, can you do it?

164
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,040
No, uncle.

165
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,140
I am not a proficient archer.

166
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,140
And uncle

167
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,130
no woman can be
important enough

168
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,110
for whom I shall
have to bear insult.

169
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,010
My dear

170
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,140
not Draupadi

171
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,200
but the relationship
with Panchal is important.

172
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,040
You know quite well

173
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,270
that Gandhar, Anga Pradesh,
Hastinapur

174
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,130
and even Ashwatthama's
half of Panchal

175
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,010
is on our side.

176
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,210
If Drupad's half of Panchal
also comes to our side

177
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,210
then very soon

178
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,170
you may become the master
of the entire Aryan region.

179
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,170
I cannot do it, uncle!

180
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,100
No one can win this competition.

181
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,030
This is not a 'swayamvar'

182
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,010
but a scheme to insult
all the Kings.

183
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,980
If they were truly looking
for a competent warrior

184
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,200
then they would also have
organized a fight with maces

185
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,040
and the ones involving
swords and spears too!

186
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,200
Who, in the whole
of the Aryan region

187
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,170
can win this competition?

188
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,130
I can win it, friend.

189
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,130
Had this competition not been
a part of a 'swayamvar'

190
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,200
I would have achieved this feat.

191
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,040
But you can still win
the competition, King of Anga.

192
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,130
No, King of Gandhar.

193
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,930
The rank of the son-in-law
of a big kingdom like Panchal

194
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,010
lies above that of
Crown Prince Duryodhan

195
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,170
and I cannot permit it.

196
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,900
But you can certainly transfer
the benefit of your victory

197
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,070
to your friend, King of Anga.

198
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,080
You must win the competition
on behalf of Duryodhan

199
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,140
and have him married
to the Princess.

200
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,930
But would it be correct?

201
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,720
Would winning a wife
for someone else

202
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
be appropriate?

203
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,130
Correct...

204
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Why not?

205
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,030
The son of Ganga, Bhishma
has done this all his life.

206
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,980
If Duryodhan permits you

207
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,100
then you may take part
in the competition.

208
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,070
I give you the permission,
friend King of Anga.

209
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,940
You must indeed

210
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,880
win this maiden for me.

211
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,900
As you say, friend.

212
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I shall take part
in this competition.
