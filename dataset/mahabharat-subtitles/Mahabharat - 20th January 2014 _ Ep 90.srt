1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,000
You cannot slay my father.

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,360
You will have to slay me first.

3
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,430
You are wonderful, Draupadi.

4
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,460
In order to re-establish
righteousness

5
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,430
I shall require two weapons.

6
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,300
You are one of them

7
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,170
and the other is Arjun.

8
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,260
What happened, Arjun?

9
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,270
Mother, I can hear
a woman crying.

10
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,340
Brother Bheem's stomach
must be growling

11
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,270
because of hunger.

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,370
My stomach's growling does not
sound like a woman crying.

13
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,170
It sounds like a lion's roar.

14
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,170
Brother Bheem!

15
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,300
Arjun...
Arjun!

16
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,090
Stop!

17
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,170
Who are you?

18
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,070
And what are you doing in this
illusory forest, alone?

19
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,130
Are you...

20
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,130
Are you an ogre or a human?

21
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,230
A human.

22
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Had I been an ogre
I would have asked you

23
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,240
whether I should fry
or roast you for my meal.

24
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,030
Show yourself

25
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,300
and tell me who you are.

26
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,010
These ogres devoured
my entire family.

27
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,200
I managed to escape
from there somehow

28
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,000
but now, I cannot find
a way out of this forest.

29
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,230
Come with me.

30
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,110
Four brothers of mine and
our mother are resting nearby.

31
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,230
We shall protect you.

32
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,030
Yudhishthir...

33
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,160
Son, where has Arjun
gone, all alone?

34
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,130
That too in this
illusory forest.

35
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,000
I am very worried about him.

36
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,000
Mother, you need not worry.

37
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,100
We shall find him.

38
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,900
I shall go look for him.
- No, Bheem.

39
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,040
Now, no one will go
anywhere, alone.

40
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,100
All of us will go together.

41
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,000
Arjun had gone
in that direction.

42
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,900
But even his footprints
are not visible.

43
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,010
I shall rip out all the trees
of this forest, mother!

44
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,060
We will find Arjun.

45
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,780
Brother Bheem

46
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,810
you may put the tree down.

47
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,900
Arjun

48
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,910
who is...

49
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,950
Mother, this maiden was crying.

50
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,840
Her

51
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,850
parents were slain by the ogres.

52
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,010
She is terrified.

53
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,810
That is why, I have
brought her to your refuge.

54
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,710
You need not worry, dear.

55
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,940
My sons will protect you.

56
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Brother Bheem will protect you.

57
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,980
Right, brother Bheem?
- What! Yes.

58
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,810
Since it is mother's order,
I shall certainly protect her.

59
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,780
Why won't I?

60
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,680
What is your name, dear?

61
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,680
How did your family end up
in this terrifying forest?

62
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,140
How did your family end up
in this terrifying forest?

63
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,140
We were on a pilgrimage.

64
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,980
We lost our way
and entered this forest

65
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,010
and...

66
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,950
And in this forest

67
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,910
the ogres...

68
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
The ogres devoured my family...

69
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,880
Calm down, dear.

70
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,080
No need to be afraid now.

71
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,110
We should leave now.

72
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,050
Yes.

73
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,880
But will you be able to walk

74
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,950
or do you need
to rest for a while?

75
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,980
She shall indeed
be able to walk, mother.

76
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,010
When I saw her,
she was sitting and crying.

77
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,070
She was not engaged
in any physical labour.

78
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,840
Arjun!

79
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,070
It is not right to laugh
at another's plight.

80
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,140
Pardon me, brother Bheem.

81
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,110
Mother asked if you will
be able to walk or not.

82
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,980
Yes, I am alright.

83
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,070
Let's go.

84
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,780
In which direction are we
proceeding, brother Yudhishthir?

85
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,910
Even the sky is not
visible here.

86
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,780
How will we find our way out?

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,810
During this season

88
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,750
the wind always blows
from East to West Nakul.

89
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,010
That is why, we are
headed towards West.

90
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,740
This is West.

91
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,910
It smells of meat from here.

92
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,750
This forest reeks
from all directions.

93
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,770
But that is the smell of food...

94
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,750
In other words,
it is the meal of the ogres.

95
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,710
And some of this smell

96
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,940
is also from the fruits that
have fallen from the trees.

97
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,850
I have become familiar
with that smell now.

98
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,970
Can you tell us from this smell

99
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,770
from where we can find
some fruits to eat?

100
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,870
Certainly. There must be
some fruit trees ahead.

101
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,720
The smell of fruits
is coming from there.

102
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,940
Wonderful!

103
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,910
How strange!
The fruit trees are so near.

104
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,940
However, brother Bheem has
not gone to pluck them yet.

105
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,680
The way you have conquered sleep

106
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,680
similarly, brother Bheem
has conquered hunger.

107
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,750
Then we need to conquer
hunger as well

108
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,710
because I do not think
that brother Bheem

109
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,680
will go to pluck fruits for us.

110
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,710
Arjun, be quiet.

111
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,650
Bheem.

112
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,870
Son, go and get the fruits.

113
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,880
As you say, mother.

114
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,480
Brother's hunger got quelled

115
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,480
even though mother
didn't feed him.

116
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,640
Many people transform pride
into their life's goal.

117
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,380
They toil away recklessly

118
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
to add a feather to
their existing pride.

119
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,480
But, what is pride in reality?

120
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,550
Have you ever thought
about that, King Drupad?

121
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,540
No.

122
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,380
If you ever had,
you would've realized that

123
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,450
a person blinded by pride
begs for respect.

124
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,410
He wants everyone to praise him.

125
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,580
He always craves to hear
about his glorious past.

126
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,350
It implies that he expects others
to acknowledge his strengths.

127
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,320
He never has faith upon himself
whatsoever.

128
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,550
He lives in fear
of being a weakling.

129
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,480
He never has any sort of power.

130
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,540
It means

131
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,510
the one filled with pride is
also surrounded by fear.

132
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,410
Your Highness.

133
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,350
Isn't pride just another name
for fear?

134
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,410
Think about it, Your Highness.

135
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,440
Your Highness.

136
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,410
Fear chains your heart

137
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,440
and pride is a link
in that chain.

138
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,570
Take yourself for instance.

139
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,510
A man drowned in pride can
never appreciate love.

140
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,440
You have earned enmity
of your friends.

141
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,370
And your children...

142
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,280
Your children are no more than
weapons of assault for you.
