1
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,230
'Guru Drona!'

2
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,990
Who are you?
- Eklavya.

3
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,960
Are you a tribal?

4
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,160
Do you come from the forest?

5
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,230
Have you come from
a different state?

6
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,160
And from whom did you learn
such extraordinary archery?

7
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,000
The one who has been
teaching you, prince.

8
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,000
Guru Drona!

9
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,070
That's a lie!

10
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,990
Child, I never accepted
you as my student.

11
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,090
Who are you?

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,030
Greetings, Sire.

13
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,970
I am the son of Nishaad, the
king of the forests of Magadha

14
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,030
Eklavya.

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,070
I secretly listen to your
teachings throughout the day

16
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,130
and practice the same
during the night

17
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,900
in front of your statue here.

18
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,990
How is that possible?

19
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,930
No one can call his ordinary
skills as a gift from me

20
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,930
and insult me.

21
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,970
Before calling me
your Guru

22
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,090
one has to prove his eligibility
to become my student.

23
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,870
Sire...

24
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,800
Whatever I have learnt till now
with your blessings

25
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,970
will prove my eligibility.

26
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,900
What have you learnt?

27
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,700
Ashwathama, my friend

28
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,790
two stones of the same
size and strength

29
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,790
what happens when they
collide with each other?

30
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,720
Both would break.

31
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,760
Have you understood anything?

32
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,770
He is the answer to Arjun.

33
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,730
Knowledge can be acquired
only by dedication.

34
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,690
All of us know that.

35
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,760
But what is the actual
importance of dedication?

36
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,770
Have we ever thought about it?

37
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,890
A human mind

38
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,790
always faces obstacles in the
process of acquiring knowledge.

39
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,900
Sometimes a student is jealous
of another student.

40
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,830
Sometimes one doubts
the teachings.

41
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,730
And sometimes the punishment
given by a teacher

42
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,790
fills the mind with fury.

43
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,830
No? Doesn't that happen?

44
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Several thoughts
distract the mind.

45
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,890
And due to such an
unstable state of mind

46
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,770
we are unable to
acquire knowledge.

47
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,860
A mind become stable
only with dedication.

48
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,860
Dedication destroys the
arrogance of a human being.

49
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,900
It eliminates feelings like
jealousy, ambition

50
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,630
it calms the heart and helps
the mind concentrate.

51
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,630
In reality

52
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,670
there is no limit for knowledge
in the creation of God

53
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,820
nor that of knowledgeable
people.

54
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,730
Guru Dattatray*
*A Hindu deity encompassing the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, collectively known as Trimurti. Teacher of Parashurama.

55
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,670
derived knowledge
from a cow and a dog.

56
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,790
In other words

57
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,830
whether it's about
spiritual knowledge

58
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,790
or knowledge about life

59
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,730
or the knowledge derived
at a hermitage

60
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,790
to acquire it

61
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,630
more than the teacher

62
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,660
our dedication towards
the teacher is more important.

63
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,540
Isn't that true?
Think about it.

64
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,800
'I am the son of Nishaad, the
king of the forests of Magadha'

65
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,790
'Eklavya.'

66
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,600
'And from whom did you learn
such extraordinary archery?'

67
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,600
'The one who has been
teaching you, prince.'

68
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,600
Witnessing Eklavya's
archery skills

69
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,600
Arjun's self confidence
has shattered.

70
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,700
Look at his state.

71
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,760
If the boy has become
so magnificent

72
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,630
in spite of watching
from a distance

73
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,730
then think

74
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,570
if he stays at the hermitage
and learns

75
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,730
what a great archer
he would become.

76
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,660
My Lord.

77
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,500
I have been observing

78
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,730
that after meeting
the boy from the forest

79
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,430
you seem to be in a dilemma.

80
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,730
You stopped eating and
sleeping altogether.

81
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,640
What is bothering you?

82
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,700
Right now, for me, justice
is injustice.

83
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,560
I am unable to
understand my duties.

84
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,690
Arjun, for the past two days
and two nights

85
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,750
you have been practicing
without rest.

86
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,590
Now stop it.
- No, brother.

87
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,630
Eklavya, just by sitting near
Guru Drona's statue

88
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,630
could learn everything
and I couldn't learn

89
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,660
anything in spite of staying
with Guru Drona.

90
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,790
Brother, I am sure there is
something lacking in my efforts.

91
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Unless I do not acquire
knowledge like Eklavya

92
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,790
until then I will not
stop practicing.

93
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,600
Come on.
Come.

94
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,790
If Eklavya becomes our friend

95
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,550
we wouldn't need to
be scared of Arjun.

96
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,630
Dushasan is right.

97
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,590
He can become the commander
of our army.

98
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,560
Ashwathama, even if
Arjun practices all his life

99
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,600
the sons of Pandu
won't be stronger than us.

100
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,630
I will personally
speak to Eklavya.

101
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,490
But how can I stay
at Hastinapur?

102
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,600
My knowledge is for Magadha.

103
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Sure. But to help your
friend for some time

104
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,430
I am sure you can
stay at Hastinapur.

105
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Once I get the kingdom

106
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,530
you can go back to Magadha.

107
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Sire!

108
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,530
Sire!

109
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,550
Where is Guru Drona?

110
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,430
And if you promise

111
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,490
I'll request my father to give
you a place at the hermitage

112
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,460
My father always listens to
me, Eklavya.

113
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,630
Of course.

114
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,620
I agree to everything
my son says.

115
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,630
You have established me
as your Guru

116
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,590
so now, I have to accept
you as my student.

117
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,390
But dear, I have a question.

118
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,560
Would you be able to give
an offering to your teacher?

119
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,390
Absolutely, Sire.

120
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,450
I will give you
whatever you desire.

121
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Until I do not make
an offering to you

122
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,490
I will not use the skills
I learned from you.

123
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Right now...

124
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,360
You will have to give it
immediately.

125
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,520
Command me, Sire.

126
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,550
As an offering you will give me

127
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,330
the thumb of your right hand.

128
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
As an offering you will give me

129
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,040
the thumb of your right hand.

130
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,080
Would you be able to do that?

131
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Your dedication
pleases me, dear.

132
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,840
Hereafter, you are my student.

133
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,840
Now you should leave
the land of Hastinapur

134
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,710
and return to Magadha.

135
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,650
Right now.

136
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,680
Your teacher commands you.
