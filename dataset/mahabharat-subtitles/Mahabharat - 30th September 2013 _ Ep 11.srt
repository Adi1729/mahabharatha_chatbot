1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,420
A person who was born blind

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,520
won't let be
Gandhari's husband, father!

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,270
Never!

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,490
Gandhari?

5
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,490
Gandhari, stop!

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,310
Gandhari!

7
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,240
It means...

8
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,280
It means, my dear sister

9
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,520
has been kept in the dark!

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,500
Firmness and callousness

11
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,320
have a very thin line
of difference, father.

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,350
But the difference itself,
runs quite deep.

13
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,540
A father is firm

14
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,510
and callous is but an enemy.

15
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,480
An enemy.

16
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,400
No, Gandhari.

17
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,270
No.

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,350
It's not the time to
shed tears, Gandhari.

19
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,450
It's not the time to cry.

20
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,480
I am still alive.

21
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,390
Your brother!

22
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,410
I will not let anything happen

23
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,340
that may cause grief to you.

24
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,500
It's my oath.

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,410
I am not scared
of Hastinapur.

26
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,510
They may have power.

27
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,430
They may have abundant wealth.

28
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,480
But you and your future

29
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,420
are not within their rights
to trample upon.

30
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,330
No rights at all!

31
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,290
Why did father do this?

32
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,400
Why didn't he inform that my
husband was born blind?

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,400
I wouldn't have at least
dreamt so big.

34
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,310
Gandhari, he isn't
your husband yet.

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,310
He isn't your husband.

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,440
The imbecile heart dreams
beyond limits, brother.

37
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,360
I had dreamt about my future.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,370
The future shattered in no time.

39
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,270
Dreams are like
a bottle filled with fireflies.

40
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Once it breaks,
all lustre is lost.

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,430
The shattered glass pierces
and bleeds the heart.

42
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,290
I am hurt

43
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,270
for father should have
at least told me.

44
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,310
Gandhari.

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,420
I will immediately send a
message to Hastinapur

46
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,480
that we do not accept
the wedding proposal.

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,250
They can attack if they wish to

48
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,520
but we do not accept
the wedding proposal.

49
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,520
We do not accept it.

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,540
Brother.

51
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,510
Didn't father have at least
that much faith in me?

52
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,520
Wasn't he confident of
the values he taught me?

53
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,310
Gandhari

54
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,440
what are you saying?

55
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,520
Brother, father has
pampered me very much.

56
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,270
Parents can never ask for
compensation of their love.

57
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,390
Cession in lieu of love can't be
forsaken by an offspring either.

58
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,450
When my parents are in a dilemma

59
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,290
I cannot refuse from
sacrificing, brother.

60
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,260
Father didn't have faith in me

61
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,310
and this bothers me.

62
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,300
But being a princess

63
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,410
I accept his decision.

64
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,390
But

65
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,520
with a man who
was born blind...

66
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,480
How would you be happy
with him, Gandhari?

67
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,340
How would you?

68
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,280
If I don't find happiness

69
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,410
then it's apt to consider
what's found to be bliss.

70
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,270
The happiness of the subjects
should be more important.

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,350
These are the values
taught by my parents.

72
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,500
As a son has rights
on his father's wealth

73
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,270
a daughter has rights on his
values, doesn't she?

74
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,320
This marriage

75
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,360
is acceptable to me.

76
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,520
But, Gandhari...

77
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,360
Brother, get ready
to proceed to Hastinapur.

78
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,570
Princess

79
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,580
why are you putting
out the lamps?

80
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,410
I am trying to get
used to darkness.

81
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,550
But, princess, aren't you
scared of darkness?

82
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,410
I am...

83
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,330
I am really scared of darkness.

84
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,520
But darkness is going to
be a part of my life.

85
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,560
I have to fight my fears.

86
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,400
Princess, you are
marrying a blind man

87
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,390
and not darkness.

88
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,470
To understand one
with dark cast over his eyes

89
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,340
one has to understand
the darkness, Sugadha.

90
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,480
How would have the prince
lived in darkness all his life?

91
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,560
When we stumble while walking

92
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,570
we are careful of
not stumbling again.

93
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,360
But

94
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,540
the prince may have

95
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,340
stumbled several times.

96
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,420
The fear of darkness must
have hounded him too.

97
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,490
Princess, I have no answers
to your questions.

98
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,540
But I have to find the
answers to all these questions.

99
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,440
Hereafter, I have to
stop depending on light.

100
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,410
I have to befriend darkness.

101
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,430
In this very darkness,
my married life

102
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,400
and steps to its success
will be visible to me.

103
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,560
Go, Sugadha.

104
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,590
Sugadha, leave!

105
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,530
'All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!'

106
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,330
'All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!'

107
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,370
'All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!'

108
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,340
'All hail!
- King Dhritarashtra!'

109
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,530
Dhritarashtra.
- Mother.

110
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,420
Greetings, mother.
- May you live long, son.

111
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,350
Mother, I... - I had seen
Gandhari yesterday.

112
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,570
The guest house used by
king of Gandhar and his family

113
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,360
she was seated there
at the porch.

114
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,500
She is really beautiful.

115
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,540
Here, wear this.

116
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,310
Mother, another piece
of ornament?

117
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,580
That isn't an ornament

118
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,440
it's a talisman.

119
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,450
Let's go.

120
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,570
The Queen Mother is eager to
take you to the wedding tent.

121
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,570
Let's proceed.

122
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,380
Where is Pandu?

123
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,320
I am here, mother.

124
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,340
Pandu, I can't see myself.

125
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,310
You should tell me,
how do I look?

126
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,380
Today is my first
meeting with Gandhari.

127
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,450
Your valour is known
all over Gandhar.

128
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,520
Your image in the eyes
of the princess

129
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,310
has already been discerned
before your meeting.

130
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,520
Let's go.

131
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,500
The auspicious time for
the wedding is nearing. - Sure.

132
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,420
Greetings, Queen Mother. - You
should go to the guest house

133
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,450
and give a message to
the king of Gandhar

134
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,420
to immediately come
along with Gandhari.

135
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,530
The auspicious time for
the wedding is here.

136
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,500
Queen Mother, their messenger
has brought a message

137
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,590
that princess Gandhari
is being adorned.

138
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,340
They will all start for here
in the next two half hours.

139
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,460
Sugadha, are you done
with the adornment?

140
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,550
Yes, princess.

141
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,580
All of you should now
wait outside my room.

142
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,560
Leave me alone for some time.

143
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,590
But, princess, it's time
for the wedding.

144
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,440
Let the future wait for me.

145
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,610
I want to be alone
for some time.

146
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,480
Leave, Sugadha.
