1
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,330
I did not get the opportunity
to meet brother Arjun again.

2
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,440
And I also could not seek
the blessings of Mother Kunti.

3
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,240
Rukmini, look behind you.

4
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,360
What do you see?

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,300
Our footprints, My Lord.

6
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
Look.

7
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,460
Those prints got washed away
by the waves, Rukmini.

8
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,430
Footprints not being visible
does not mean

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,400
that the ones who made them
are also not present.

10
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,340
Does this mean
the Pandavas are alive?

11
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,330
I do not know

12
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,200
but if they are alive

13
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,310
then I need to meet them soon.

14
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,430
But why do you not answer me
whether they are alive or not?

15
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,190
A definite answer?

16
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,330
Its definite answer is, Rukmini

17
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,430
that it is time for
the entire society to change.

18
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,360
Look from Magadha to Matsya

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,310
and from Kuru to Vidarbha.

20
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,390
Subjects...

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,130
Subjects toil in the fields.

22
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,360
They enter the mines to dig out
iron, gold and precious gems.

23
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,170
They break down rocks
to construct buildings.

24
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,230
In other words, subjects yield
the entire wealth.

25
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,430
But what do they get in return?

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,300
They get hunger, poverty

27
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,360
and injustice in return.

28
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,230
And the Kings, Rulers
and Emperors get wealthier.

29
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,300
Have you ever seen a King who is
concerned for his subjects?

30
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,130
A King who is concerned
for their happiness.

31
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,200
A King who is concerned
for their welfare.

32
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,300
No, correct?

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,100
And this is what God

34
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,270
calls unrighteousness.

35
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,270
When such unrighteousness
gets out of hand

36
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,300
in order to salvage the world,
God gives birth to people

37
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,370
who have
a righteous heart.

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,230
Until things change

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,130
until subjects of a kingdom
gain true happiness

40
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,330
those great men sent by God
do not die, Rukmini.

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,260
I have complete faith
that they are alive.

42
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,130
And I shall meet them very soon

43
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,230
in Panchal.

44
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,160
Why in Panchal?

45
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,070
We shall meet in Panchal,
Rukmini

46
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,140
because there in the mud
of unrighteousness

47
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
the lotus of righteousness
is about to be born.

48
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,230
Such a power is about
to be born there

49
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,240
that will change the future
of the entire Aryan region.

50
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,210
And I have to go there
to protect this power.

51
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,260
From who?

52
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,240
From the one who is going
to give birth to that power.

53
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,060
In other words

54
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,260
from the King of Panchal,
Drupad.

55
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,970
'Panchal
- the City of Kampilya.'

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,230
W-Water...

57
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,940
With whose permission are you
giving him water, Shikhandini?

58
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,110
If they do not get water,
they will die.

59
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,970
And we will commit the sin
of killing a sage, father.

60
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,060
Fool!
They are fated to die.

61
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,940
He is not a sage

62
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,930
but a charlatan!

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,030
All of them are charlatans!

64
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,110
If the water of a river

65
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,040
is unfit for drinking

66
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,100
it is best for that river
to dry up.

67
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,930
If your rigourous meditation
cannot give me a son

68
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,990
then why

69
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,940
should I allow you to live?

70
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,870
But you are destined

71
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,870
to have a daughter,
Your Highness.

72
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,870
You shall not have a son.

73
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,060
Stop, King Drupad.

74
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,940
King Drupad,
by killing these sages

75
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,000
you are paving your way to hell.

76
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,890
We shall fulfill your wish.

77
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,960
The great sages Yaja

78
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,870
and Upayaja,*
*Two sage brothers that lived on the banks of the Ganga.

79
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,810
when I had approached you

80
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,970
you had no intention of
performing a 'yajna' for me.

81
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,960
Are you scared now

82
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,860
that you will die at my hands?

83
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,970
We do not fear for our lives

84
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,940
but for that of
thousands of sages.

85
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,830
So, in order to save the lives
of a handful of sages

86
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,930
you are going to perform
a charade of a 'yajna?'

87
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Or in order to
bless me with a son

88
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,860
you wish to perform the 'yajna'

89
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,900
great sage Yaja?

90
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,830
Tell me the truth.

91
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,900
You shall indeed have a son
from the 'yajna.'

92
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,930
But King Drupad

93
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,810
you are destined
to have a daughter.

94
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,930
And when you
accept your daughter

95
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,900
only then will you get your son

96
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,800
from the Gods.

97
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,860
And when you
accept your daughter

98
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,760
only then will you get your son

99
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,790
from the Gods.
- Daughter!

100
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,690
I have got nothing
to do with a daughter!

101
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,660
She cannot defend
the honour of her father!

102
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,850
She cannot take revenge
for the insult he faced!

103
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,690
This Shikhandini...

104
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,660
At the time of her birth,
everyone had said

105
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,790
that Bhishma will die
at her hands!

106
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,600
He had insulted my father!

107
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,860
She was supposed to
take revenge for that!

108
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,730
With that hope in his heart

109
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,790
my father passed away!

110
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,630
But she did nothing.

111
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
In order to have a son

112
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,590
if I need to accept a daughter
then so be it!

113
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,720
She can stay in a corner
of my palace!

114
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,820
But I

115
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,600
want a son.

116
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,820
Your words reflect ignorance,
Your Highness.

117
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,690
In this world
it is the greatest honour

118
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,690
to have a daughter.

119
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,760
Do not forget that he had
given birth only to daughters

120
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,600
yet we call Daksh* as Prajapati.**
*"Competent", a great king, he had 89 daughters from his wife Prasuti and another 116 from his wife Panchajani (Virini).
**"Lord of creatures".

121
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,520
It was through his daughters
that life sprang in all spheres.

122
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,520
King Drupad

123
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
understand this truth real well.

124
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
The maiden born from the 'yajna'

125
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,530
will fulfill

126
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,630
all your hopes and desires.

127
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,590
She will gain fame
in the entire Aryan region

128
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,790
for the re-establishment
of righteousness.

129
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,520
That maiden

130
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,730
will change
the course of history

131
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,560
and will mould

132
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,550
the future.

133
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,460
You have brought us
our meal, Arjun.

134
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,430
Come on.
We'll finish all this later.

135
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,550
Duryodhan may snatch
a palace from me

136
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,420
but not my teeth and stomach.

137
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
No matter how hard
he tries to cause me pain

138
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,560
but as long as I can eat

139
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,430
nothing can pain me.

140
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,450
Mother

141
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,390
do serve us our meal.

142
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,490
Do begin.

143
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Stop, mother.

144
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,240
Looking at this meal
has reminded me of something.

145
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,300
When we were dining
for the first time in Hastinapur

146
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,370
grandsire had told us

147
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,460
to eat without folding our arms.

148
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,270
Can you show us how to do so?

149
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,360
Without folding the arm?

150
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,270
Mother

151
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,360
as long as we are together

152
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,400
you will not shed tears.

153
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,230
As long as we are together

154
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,370
neither do we
need to fold our arms

155
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,140
nor bow our heads before anyone.

156
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,160
But all of us must take turns
to feed brother Bheem.

157
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,260
I cannot feed him every day.
