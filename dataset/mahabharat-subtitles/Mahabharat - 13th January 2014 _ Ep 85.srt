1
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,820
A fiery glowing visage

2
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,870
a torrid vigour

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,810
and a fervent soul define

4
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,710
your daughter, father.

5
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,620
This boon from the very gods
pays you her respects.

6
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,710
There's no need to
touch my feet.

7
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,810
The boon from the gods
can't be kept at my feet

8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,550
and I, Drupad, doesn't let
anyone rule over him.

9
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,650
Then I have
just one apt place left.

10
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,790
That would be your heart.

11
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,620
Let's go, Dhrishtadyumna.

12
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,650
Panchal and I, your father,
have waited long for you.

13
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,590
You have to fulfil the oath
of your father soon.

14
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,680
Definitely, father.

15
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,450
Draupadi

16
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,680
I am your sister, Shikhandini.

17
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,680
Isn't father

18
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,620
happy about my birth?

19
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,450
When the sky is overcast

20
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,450
the sunlight doesn't lighten
up the earth.

21
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,650
His nous
is now clouded with rage.

22
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,520
But in due time
father will surely come to know

23
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,520
that you are the fortune
of Panchal.

24
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,410
Come on.

25
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,550
The customary bathing ritual
is at hand.

26
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,450
Follow me, Draupadi.

27
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,480
Draupadi!
Draupadi!

28
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,410
This is your room.

29
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,410
All the females of
the royal palace stay here.

30
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,410
Attendants!

31
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,480
Draupadi's customary bath

32
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,390
needs the bath to be prepped.

33
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,480
'Panchkavya',* sandalwood paste,
*"Mixture of five products."

34
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,450
perfumed oil and others
must be arranged there.

35
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,320
Sushma go and get the
offerings made

36
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,410
to Goddess Parvati
from the temple.

37
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,380
Anuradha, arrange for clothes

38
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,440
and jewellery for the princess.

39
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,210
Princess, you collided with
the mirror knowingly, right?

40
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,350
Draupadi this is a mirror.

41
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,190
Who is this?

42
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,090
That's your reflection.

43
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,220
Panchal's most beautiful woman.
That's you, Draupadi.

44
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,190
Princess, don't you even know
what a mirror is?

45
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,010
Draupadi

46
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,050
all the gods have bestowed you
with every form of knowledge.

47
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:55,160
But not of those objects
that were made by man, not God.

48
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,210
Come on. Your customary bath's
time is at hand.

49
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,530
Draupadi

50
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,600
after the bath the attendants
will groom you.

51
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,670
Post that, we'd set out to
visit Goddess Parvati's temple.

52
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,670
I'll be back after arranging
the bodyguards and palanquin.

53
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,330
Malini how dare you
jest with the Princess!

54
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,460
Beg her pardon.
- Why so?

55
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,620
I wasn't miffed.

56
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,390
As you say, Princess.

57
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,330
But the progeny of attendants
should mind their limits.

58
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,330
Limits are defined by
one's disposition.

59
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
That's decided by one
[himself] herself.

60
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,400
One that ought to be minded
isn't a limit but a prohibition.

61
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,530
What are you holding?

62
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,490
It's a dolly.

63
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,330
What would you do with it?

64
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,460
I would get her married

65
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,330
with a nice and handsome doll.

66
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,520
All the girls have a dolly.

67
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,330
Have you never seen one?

68
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,490
Malini the Princess
was never a child.

69
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,460
She was born a youth.

70
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,460
She appeared out of the flames
of a 'yajna'.

71
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,500
She hasn't passed childhood.

72
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
What happens in childhood?

73
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,260
It's full of joy, Princess.

74
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,330
The entire world seems like
a curious puzzle to be solved.

75
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,360
There's no joy!

76
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,300
Mother keeps hitting me.

77
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,400
Always pointing out faults
and bossing me around.

78
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,450
I just wish to grow up soon.

79
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,360
Okay, then.

80
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,450
Fine.

81
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,330
You become my friend
and make me experience childhood

82
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,360
and when I come to know
how it feels to be a grownup

83
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,460
I will let you know.

84
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,330
So?
Would you be my friend?

85
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,390
But, Princess

86
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,260
she's an attendant's daughter.

87
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,320
An attendant's daughter can't
be friends with a Princess.

88
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,160
Really?

89
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,290
But we are friends!

90
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,260
Because we both can't understand
that difference.

91
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,160
She's so pretty!
- You are very pretty!

92
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,250
Even more
than this dolly of mine.

93
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,160
My dolly will marry
a handsome doll.

94
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,300
You too must get married
to a handsome prince, Princess.
