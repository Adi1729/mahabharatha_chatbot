1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,800
I must discharge my duties.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,320
Then grandsire,
what is the solution?

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,000
May you live long.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,280
There is only one solution,
dear.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,440
Whoever takes sides
with the unrighteous

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,120
needs to be slain by you.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,560
You need not ponder
why one is protecting

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,800
the unrighteous.

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,880
Just engage in the battle.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
There is no other way now
to keep Hastinapur

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,680
safe from a battle.

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
If we do engage
in a battle, grandsire

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
then Panchali's father
will charge with his army too.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
King Virat will also
take part in it.

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,280
Even the King of Gandhar
will charge with his army then.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
The army of Anga
will also take part in it.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,560
Eventually all the Kings
will take part in this battle.

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,800
In other words

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,960
it will become a war for the
entire Aryan region soon.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,080
Millions of soldiers
will be killed

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,440
numerous women
will be left widowed

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
and the battlefield will

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,080
engulf the future of numerous
children in darkness grandsire.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,640
There will be destruction
on a massive scale.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
How can punishing the entire

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,080
Aryan region for our
personal insult be correct?

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,760
Had I deemed this
your personal insult

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,000
I would never have advised you
to engage in a battle.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,520
Before sowing wheat
in the fields

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,200
the remainder of the old crops
need to be pulled out.

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,240
To establish righteousness
in the Aryan region once again

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,960
the old unrighteous ways
need to be annihilated.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,160
Vasudev Krishna was correct.

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
A war is mandatory.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,880
Vasudev had asked me

36
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,600
on which side I will be.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,920
My weapons shall be
subservient to Hastinapur

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
but my blessings

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,280
will be for the five of you.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
Go on.

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,640
Gather all the Kings
of the Aryan region

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,480
who are on your side.

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
Be prepared for the war.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Make your grandsire proud by
displaying unparalleled valour.

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,880
May you live long!

46
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
May you be victorious!

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,080
You let the Pandavas go,
grandsire.

48
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,040
Why were people
who attacked Hastinapur

49
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
not slain by you?

50
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,720
I had set about to protect
Hastinapur, dear

51
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,600
and that is precisely
what I did.

52
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,400
I do not attack the ones

53
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
who do not
take to arms before me.

54
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,160
The Pandavas have challenged
the Crown Prince of Hastinapur

55
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
to a battle.

56
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,000
Protecting me

57
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,200
is your duty,
grandsire.

58
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,040
And until I am alive

59
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
I shall keep discharging
that duty, Crown Prince.

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,600
However,
when I die

61
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,720
in the battlefield

62
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,760
you will have to face
your punishment.

63
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,040
How can you die,
grandsire?

64
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,120
You have been blessed
with the boon to die at will.

65
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
Do not forget

66
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,640
that they know
how to kill me, dear.

67
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,240
The day the daughter of Drupad
Shikhandini will stand before me

68
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,120
I will have to lay
my weapons down.

69
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
That day

70
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,080
all of you will have to
protect yourselves

71
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,680
and that day will arrive soon.

72
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,640
Very soon, the Pandavas
will attack with their army

73
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,640
and the...

74
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,320
And the competence
all of you take such pride in

75
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,680
will be put to the test as well

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,360
and that too very soon.

77
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
Indeed...

78
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,080
The advice to attack Hastinapur
must indeed

79
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,760
have been given by you,
Your Excellency Bhishma.

80
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
It is their right.

81
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,000
I have merely

82
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
given them my support.

83
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,000
In other words

84
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,920
you

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,040
decided on your own

86
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,840
to take the greatness
of Hastinapur

87
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,720
and destroy it,
Your Excellency Bhishma?!

88
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,680
If the Pandavas lose

89
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,680
then the prosperity
of the Kuru kingdom

90
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
will be destroyed

91
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
but even if they win

92
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
the Kuru kingdom

93
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,560
will be left impoverished.

94
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Who will benefit
from this battle

95
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,520
Your Excellency Bhishma?

96
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,320
We are the unrighteous

97
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,920
but what about
your righteous ways?

98
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,520
You

99
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,640
broke a vow

100
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
renounced love

101
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,400
and betrayed the trust.

102
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,840
You have become the cause
of death of millions of people.

103
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,720
You have

104
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,040
tarnished life

105
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
and transformed death

106
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,680
into agony.

107
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,080
Your Excellency...

108
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Your Excellency!

109
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,640
Let's go

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,040
my...

111
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,040
My

112
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,800
darlings.

113
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,260
For numerous years

114
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,180
I have hidden myself
from you, mother.

115
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,100
How could I face you
after being a part

116
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,740
of the shameful game of dice?

117
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,420
By standing in your waters

118
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,740
I have offered holy water
to Surya Dev in a manner

119
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,540
similar to a person
bearing a white cloth

120
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,740
and trying to clean
a piece of coal.

121
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,980
The cloth becomes dirty

122
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,180
but the coal
does not become clean.

123
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,940
I too have tarnished your name
in the game of dice, mother.

124
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,540
How can...

125
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,820
How can I attain
salvation from this dilemma?

126
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,620
On one hand, there were
the duties stemming from my oath

127
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,100
and on the other, my vow to walk
on the path of righteousness.

128
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,380
I have attempted to end
this dilemma today, mother.

129
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,620
But how could I have sown
the seed of a great war?

130
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,940
I have become the cause
of death of millions of people.

131
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,300
How can I

132
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,340
attain liberation
from this sin, mother?

133
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,500
How can I?

134
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,140
Son

135
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,980
you have attained liberation
from all your sins today.

136
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,380
Liberation?

137
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,140
How is that,
mother?

138
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,780
I could have averted this war

139
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,380
but in the greed to help
the Pandavas get justice

140
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,460
I have subjected
the entire Aryan region

141
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,260
to an exceedingly grave crisis.

142
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,540
How could you

143
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,340
have averted this war,
son Devavrat?

144
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,700
I could have
defeated the Pandavas.

145
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,580
I could have slain all of them,
mother

146
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,700
though that would indeed
have been a grave sin.

147
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,660
For all these years

148
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,460
my efforts to keep Duryodhan
away from the throne

149
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,780
would have gone in vain

150
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,740
but at least this war
would not have arisen, mother.

151
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,940
But why do you wish
to keep Duryodhan

152
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,980
away from
the throne, son?

153
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,420
Duryodhan deems the throne
a piece of property

154
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,980
and not a duty.

155
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,220
When he ascends the throne

156
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,700
he will unleash such a reign
of unrighteousness

157
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,220
that in the future

158
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,420
the subjects will experience
nothing but misery.

159
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,780
In other words, the future of
the subjects of the Aryan region

160
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,620
has been safeguarded
by you, son.

161
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,100
But what about the present?

162
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,060
I have filled the present
of the subjects with agony.

163
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,220
I can see

164
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,820
millions of dead people
floating on your waters.

165
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,460
Millions of people are scattered

166
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,980
in my waters in the form
of ashes every day

167
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,820
and it will continue to be so.

168
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,100
By averting a war

169
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,940
no one can become
immortal, son.

170
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,620
However,
in the future

171
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,380
establishing righteousness again
will become highly difficult.

172
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,100
In the life of man

173
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,620
he does not have a choice
between struggle and peace, son.

174
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,660
He has a choice

175
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,660
between less and more struggle.

176
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,980
This is the truth of life.

177
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,660
You may have

178
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,780
burdened the subjects with
the struggle of a great war, son

179
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,300
but you have curtailed
the struggles

180
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,900
of the forthcoming generations
today itself.

181
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,860
That is why, do not doubt
your decision, dear.

182
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,460
You have been liberated
from all your sins today.

183
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,340
Go on

184
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,060
and discharge

185
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,020
your duties in this war

186
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,540
and await

187
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,300
your salvation with joy.

188
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,380
Now, this battle has become
our duty, brother Yudhishthir.

189
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,140
The way a crazed horse

190
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,220
jumps off a cliff
along with the chariot

191
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,660
similarly even Duryodhan

192
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,300
is propelling the entire society
towards a war.

193
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,580
How can we stop him?

194
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,780
If we give up our greed
to have the empire

195
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,100
and decide to spend
our remaining lives in a forest

196
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,740
then the war can be averted.

197
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,900
Should we not punish them
for insulting Panchali then?

198
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,100
Should we allow Duryodhan to
commit more misdeeds, brother?

199
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,420
We are the sons of a King.

200
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,340
Despite living in a forest,
father had imparted to you

201
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,940
all the qualities
of being a good King.

202
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,740
How can we forsake
the society so?

203
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,220
But how can we

204
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,860
battle grandsire and Guru Drona
in the battlefield?

205
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,940
In both the armies

206
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,540
we have people who are related
to us in some way or the other.

207
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,900
How can we watch them die?

208
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,380
When grandsire had
asked us to take to arms

209
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,340
Arjun, you were
the first to say

210
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,860
that your arrows
can never be aimed at him!

211
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,020
Then how will you
pick up your bow?

212
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,300
But you never disobey
grandsire, My Lord

213
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,780
and even the order
to engage in this war

214
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
was his.

215
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,580
He cannot be dissuaded.

216
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,660
Just think of grandsire's
mental state, My Lord.

217
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,860
He must have turned his heart
to stone before asking you

218
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,940
to attack him.

219
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,020
What could have been
the reason, My Lord?

220
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,300
He saw his daughter-in-law
being disrobed in the court

221
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,820
and yet he said nothing.

222
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,300
The tie that had
rendered him speechless

223
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,060
must indeed have
given him great pain.

224
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,300
If he could, he would have burnt
all sinners with his mere eyes.

225
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,340
Can you imagine the dejection

226
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,980
he must have felt when his eyes
were flooded with tears?

227
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,260
He is not asking
for a war, My Lord.

228
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,340
He is asking for liberation.

229
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,020
Nevertheless

230
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,580
if all of you doubt
the decision of a war

231
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,740
then go to Dwaraka
and question Govind.

232
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,900
I have firm faith

233
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,140
that Govind will indeed be
on our side in the war.

234
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,740
Panchali is correct.

235
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,620
If Vasudev is willing
to take our side in this war

236
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,900
then we can indeed believe
that this war

237
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,500
is a righteous one.
