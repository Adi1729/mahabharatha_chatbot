1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,980
What has happened to you, sister?

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,080
Sister!
Please get up!

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,100
Sanjay, now nobody can
stop my son's victory dance.

4
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,000
How much longer to sunset, Sanjay?

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,940
Not too long to go,
Your Highness!

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,080
This duration of time
will serve as a jolt

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,980
to the Pandavas!

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,210
Sanjay, Shikhandi's death
is now certain.

9
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,180
It is certain.

10
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,100
My Queen, her heartbeats seems
to have stopped.

11
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,070
I don't think she can survive now.

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,200
If Grandsire Bhishma does not die today

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,980
we will surely lose this war.

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,210
You will have to rise again.

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,990
You will have to go to the battlefield.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,020
Rise!

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,060
Sister, you must.

18
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,130
Madhav, there is very
little time left for sunset.

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,970
Where is Shikhandi?

20
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,940
Arjuna, do not worry about Shikhandi.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,220
He will only cause Grandsire
to lay down his weapons.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,950
You will have to take the
fight to him thereafter.

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,210
To bring that great man down

24
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,060
all five of you brothers
will need to work together.

25
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,110
Master, do allow your student
to showcase his skills!

26
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,210
You are sure to die by my hands.

27
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,090
This is sure to happen today.

28
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,160
Charioteer, the Pandavas
are approaching him.

29
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,240
- Take me there.
- Stop right there, Duryodhan!

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,120
Do not worry about Grandsire!

31
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Duryodhan, you should be
more concerned about yourself.

32
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,970
Lord Surya!

33
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,170
When Vichitravirya had died
I had called out to you.

34
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,120
Today, I request you.

35
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,210
Please wait a while longer.

36
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,990
After many years,
the possibility of my death

37
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,180
looks possible and near.

38
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,030
Please

39
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,130
let this happen.

40
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,090
May God bless all of you,
my dear.

41
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,110
The sunset is upon us.
Do not wait any longer for

42
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,170
Princess Amba.

43
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,180
Use all your combined powers
and attack me together.

44
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,080
Prince Bhima.

45
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,990
Take your mace and step down from chariot.

46
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,960
We are short on time.

47
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,130
If all five of you attack me together

48
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,070
you will surely be able to kill me.

49
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,040
Do not wait for Princess Amba.

50
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,010
Attack me, dear.

51
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,140
No, Grandsire.

52
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,080
How can all of us attack you together?

53
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,050
If four of my beloved ones lift

54
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,120
my bier during my last moments

55
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,160
and one of you takes the
fire to light the bier

56
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,160
I will consider myself extremely fortunate.

57
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,100
It is time for my departure.

58
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,040
Nakula, Sahadeva, get your weapons.

59
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,060
You have taught us the path of 
righteousness, Grandsire.

60
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,160
We cannot do this to you.

61
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,230
I saw the true face of righteousness yesterday.

62
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,120
For the first time ever.

63
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,030
After taking a lesson in
righteousness from Lord Kishna.

64
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,110
I order you...

65
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,120
to attack me together
as that is appropriate.

66
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,030
Do not shed tears.

67
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,030
You are about to bring
salvation upon me.

68
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Arjuna.

69
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,230
Your powers...

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,070
don't need Amba's support.

71
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,020
Your powers will inspire millions

72
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,020
of others in times to come.

73
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,220
Take your weapons and attack me.

74
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,150
Dear, your weapons will
not cause me pain.

75
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,090
Instead I will be relieved!

76
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,170
Attack me!

77
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,110
Attack me!

78
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,000
Why are you standing silent?
Attack me!

79
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,210
Attack me!

80
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,020
My child, go and kill Shikhandi.

81
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,190
Hurry up!

82
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,060
Until we live, we will not allow
them to harm you.

83
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,040
Now, it is our responsibility 
to take you to Grandsire.

84
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,130
Attack me, Bhima.

85
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,160
Attack me, Bhima!

86
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,940
I command you!

87
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,460
Attack me, Bhima.

88
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,880
Attack me, Bhima.

89
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,070
Brilliant, Bhima!

90
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,920
You are an excellent mace fighter!

91
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,970
Sahadev, slay me!

92
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,840
Slay me!

93
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,820
These hands have comitted 
many sins!

94
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,820
My silence has caused much 
injustice in this lifetime!

95
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,960
This life of mine must ends!

96
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:40,990
This life should ends.

97
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,900
At the hands of you five,
my lads.

98
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,930
Yudhisthir, my lad.

99
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,850
Fight!
Fight!

100
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,020
Fight with all your might, my lad!

101
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,810
Do not wait for Shikhandi, my lad!

102
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,970
The sun is about to set. 
Attack me!

103
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,930
When your soul is plagued by age and exhaustion, 
I shall arrive as your death!

104
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,060
Your wait has come to an end, 
Grandsire Bheeshma!

105
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,160
Your redemption stands 
right before you!

106
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:52,050
Complete your life's purpose, 
Lady Amba!

107
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,120
The cause of your death is present 
before you, Bheeshma!

108
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,210
Recall your promise!

109
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,050
I make a promise...

110
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,290
I shall lay down all my weapons 
before you.

111
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,210
Grant me redemption, Lady Amba!
