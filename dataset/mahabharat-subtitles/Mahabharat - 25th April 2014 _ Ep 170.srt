1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,520
Prince Uttar.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,750
Would you like to be the chariot
rider for Pandu's son Arjun?

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,610
Pandu's son?

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,650
Are you Arjun himself?

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,450
Under this guise?

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,580
Capability is determined
neither by guise

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,710
nor by name.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,590
Capability lies in the mind.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,490
Steer the chariot, Prince Uttar.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,560
Today, Arjun will fight,
not Brihannala!

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,590
Today, I must teach
prince Duryodhan

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,660
the laws of the battlefield.

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,580
This surely is

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,480
the reverberation of
Arjun's 'Gandiva' bow.

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,420
Yes, prince Duryodhan!

16
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,590
This indeed is Arjun.

17
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,520
Just by the reverberation
of his bow

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,550
seems to instill
terror in your heart.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,520
How will you defend yourself

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,390
from the arrows fired
from this bow?

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,550
You were very eager
to face Arjun.

22
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,650
Arjun is here now.

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Before commencing the battle

24
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,350
I convey my greetings
to Grandsire Bheeshma.

25
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,510
Live long and prosper!

26
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,550
I, Arjun, the son of Pandu

27
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,580
owing to the archery skills
taught by you

28
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,510
challenge you for battle!

29
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,420
Prince Duryodhan!

30
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,320
I have waited days and nights

31
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,410
to raise my bow against you!

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,450
Today, I shall teach you

33
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,380
the laws of the battlefield!

34
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410
Arjun!

35
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,450
There is no need
for battle at all.

36
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,510
Because your exile
has rendered to be a failure.

37
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,380
It is your plan that has failed,
Prince Duryodhan!

38
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,290
Look towards the sun!

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,550
The duration of my exile
is complete!

40
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,410
Your exile has failed.

41
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,390
If you act immorally

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,250
I shall crush you!

43
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,420
Soldiers!
Attack!

44
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,410
Do you think flaunting your
archery before a mace fighter

45
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,280
makes you powerful, Arjun?

46
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,420
Just as a crow bothering
an elephant and flying away

47
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,150
you come across as
weak and evasive!

48
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,380
Fight with me.

49
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,410
Fight with me!

50
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,320
Prince Uttar, this is no more
your fight.

51
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,280
Now, Arjun's 'Gandiva'
shall dispense justice!

52
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Friend Karna.

53
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,050
Fire the celestial weapon!

54
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,800
Why are you blocking
my arrows, Grandsire?

55
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,780
Grandsire Bheeshma, does Arjun
still need your protection?

56
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,650
I do not wish to shatter this
barrier you conjured, Grandsire!

57
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,870
Please clear the way yourself!

58
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,850
Today is the time to
avenge our humiliation!

59
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,710
Grandsire Bheeshma!
Such partiality!

60
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,870
Just to protect Arjun

61
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,770
you are ceasing
an ongoing battle?

62
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,780
Grandsire, this is
national treason!

63
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,870
Do not intervene in this battle!

64
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,840
Let this battle commence!

65
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,770
Duryodhan, you fool!

66
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,750
I am being partial
for your sake!

67
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,830
Or else

68
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,640
Arjun shall obliterate you all!

69
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,710
If you so confident
about Arjun's capability

70
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,740
then get out of the way!

71
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,740
I do not need
anyone's protection!

72
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,810
I do need protection,
O' armoured one!

73
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,870
My heart does need protection.

74
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Arjun, my lad.

75
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,710
My arms are so powerful today.

76
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,610
But my heart...

77
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,650
My heart cannot bear
another trauma.

78
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,780
Arjun, my lad.

79
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,740
Cease this battle for today.

80
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,710
Do not sabotage your Grandsire's
love and trust.

81
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,740
When the blood of
my own kin is shed

82
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,600
won't the heart of your
Grandsire cringe in woe?

83
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,580
Please spare my aged eyes
of this terrible sight.

84
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,600
I have the boon
of death at will.

85
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,510
Do not give me a reason
to crave for death, O' lad.

86
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,740
Do not say that, Grandsire.

87
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,770
If I become
the cause of your death

88
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,580
I shall experience damnation
all though my life.

89
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,640
The one whom I always
respectfully bow down to

90
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,540
how can I raise my arm
against that person?

91
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,670
So cease this battle today,
my lad.

92
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,770
Please respect your
Grandsire's word.

93
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,570
Today I abide by your order,
Grandsire.

94
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,480
But you must give me your word.

95
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,510
If in future

96
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,410
a situation for war
presents itself

97
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,440
you shall not stop me!

98
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,600
Promise me, Grandsire!

99
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,610
Arjun!

100
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,540
Now the situation for battle

101
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,500
shall never arise.

102
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,570
Because you shall dwell
in the forests

103
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,670
and we shall live in the city!

104
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,670
The chance for battle
has arisen, Prince Duryodhan!

105
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,410
When ought to foolishness

106
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,380
a deer lurks into a lion's cave

107
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,640
it faces death that very moment!

108
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,450
All the deer is left with
are a few moments of struggle!

109
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,480
You may struggle too,
Prince Duryodhan!

110
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,410
Soon, the five Pandavas
shall arrive to punish you

111
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,410
for humiliating a woman

112
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,600
guised as your death!

113
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,700
'Come!
Slave Draupadi!

114
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,590
'Sit on my lap!
Come!'

115
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,790
'The way, in the courtroom
of Indraprastha'

116
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,690
'disarmed us in front of
the entire Arya clan'

117
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,620
'the same way,'

118
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,600
'disrobe her in this courtroom.'

119
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,660
'Just wearing nuptial jewellery
does not make a woman pristine.'

120
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,730
'How could such a woman
be worthy of our clan'

121
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,690
'who bears a relationship
with five men at once?'

122
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,720
'Such women are harlots!'

123
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,720
No, Panchali!

124
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,460
This isn't the time
to shed tears.

125
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,490
Only blood shall be shed now.

126
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
All those who humiliated you

127
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,530
shall bleed from their hearts.

128
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,550
Do you think I thirst for blood,
my love?

129
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,590
Why such a question, Panchali?

130
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,460
Time heals all wounds.

131
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,690
It is a common belief.

132
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,650
But even an exile of 13 years

133
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,650
could not heal the wounds
inflicted upon my honour.

134
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,620
That scene from
the filled courtroom

135
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,430
still makes my soul
writhe in agony.

136
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,490
Now I just yearn for war
day and night.

137
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,360
No, Panchali.

138
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,650
In all these 13 years

139
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,550
your heart doesn't crave
solely for vengeance.

140
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
It craves for dispensing
of justice.

141
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,450
The determination
to cleanse the society

142
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,400
grows firmer with time.

143
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,650
As honey ages

144
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,590
it develops medicinal qualities.

145
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,550
Therefore, Lord Krishna
has filled our hearts

146
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,390
not with vengeance

147
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,450
but a craving for justice.

148
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,430
Arjun is right, Panchali.

149
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,620
There is no need to brood.

150
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,360
Soon, the punishment for
the sons of Dhritarashtra

151
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,450
shall be announced.

152
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,550
And that punishment

153
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,560
shall be dictated by
the Arya clan's heiress.

154
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,390
The punishment of
the sons of Pandu

155
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,290
shall now be dictated by me!

156
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,450
The Pandavas

157
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,430
are still bound to dwell the
forests for 12 years, My Lord!

158
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,400
Because, before their exile
was complete

159
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,300
I had reckoned Arjun's truth.

160
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,390
When you saw Arjun

161
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,360
the sun had already set, Prince.

162
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,400
His exile has been a success.

163
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,330
You have to accept this fact,
Duryodhan, my boy.

164
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,260
That is justice.

165
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,300
When Arjun had entered
the battlefield with his bow

166
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,330
the night phase had
not yet begun, Grandsire.

167
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,290
It was indeed the last day
of their exile.

168
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,260
But the day had not passed then.

169
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,480
Therefore

170
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,220
the sons of Pandu
have to accept

171
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,230
dwelling the forests
for 12 years

172
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,260
and a year of exile.

173
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,330
This is law, Grandsire.

174
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,450
Duryodhan has violated
all codes of law, elder brother.

175
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,420
Even now he must be planning
something new for sure.

176
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,330
Brother Bheem is right.

177
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,290
Before brother Bheem
gets a chance to reign

178
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,290
we have to punish him.

179
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,360
If you have to catch a prey

180
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,360
quickness matters
more than strength.

181
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
But

182
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,190
is Grandsire's consent
not necessary

183
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,160
before launching the attack?

184
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,220
In order to retaliate
to our attack

185
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,360
what if Grandsire
enters the battlefield?

186
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,350
What do we do then?

187
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,300
Grandsire will not stand up
against us in the battlefield.

188
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
He knows who is just.

189
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,420
But Grandsire's duty

190
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,390
is to watch over
the throne of Hastinapur.
