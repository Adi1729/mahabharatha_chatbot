1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,940
Your Highness

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,100
why did you halt
the chariot here?

3
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,970
The first time

4
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,940
I had entered Hastinapur...

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,900
It was on a chariot.

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,900
But

7
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,100
this time

8
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,980
I am the culprit of Hastinapur.

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,840
I couldn't protect

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,910
its King.

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,980
I have no right to enter

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,930
riding on this chariot.
- Your Highness

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,980
even today, you are
the Queen of Hastinapur.

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,100
And the future Queen Mother.

15
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,110
Who has ever known

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,970
what the womb
of the future

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,980
gives birth to, Vidur?

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,070
Hence I request you,
Your Highness

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,900
enter the kingdom
as the Queen.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,880
15 years earlier when
you had gone to the forest...

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,910
Those circumstances

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,910
don't exist anymore,
Your Highness.

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,940
Today, against
these five boys

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,000
a 100 boys are
standing there.

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,930
If you surrender your
rights, Your Highness

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,940
then the rights of your sons
too will be lost.

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,810
That which is lost

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,840
is ambition.

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,810
Not rights.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,030
My husband has
taught my sons

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,870
the right values.

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,830
Sons

33
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,030
come here.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,980
Yes, mother.
- Yes, mother.

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,000
This Hastinapur

36
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,830
is your house.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,930
Henceforth

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,770
your father figure will be
your grandfather

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,740
Bhishma. Dhritarashtra
will be your uncle.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,840
And Gandhari, your aunt.

41
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,000
Serving them will be
your duty.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,740
Here, you have
a 100 brothers.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,830
Be loving towards them.

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
Reciprocating their love

45
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,910
will be your duty.

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,770
Here, there will be no
differentiation between

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,710
Gandhari's 100 sons
and Kunti's five sons.

48
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,760
Here

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,710
there will be the 105 sons
of the Kuru clan.

50
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,970
These are the Pandavs.

51
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,740
The five Pandavs.

52
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,830
Because of them

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,810
you couldn't be coronated
as the Crown Prince.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,780
But you yourself had
advised His Highness

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,740
that my coronation
cannot take place now.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,870
My dear!

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,940
My dear

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,930
I had to say this

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,840
because of that old man.

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,900
He says

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
that he will not
be partial.

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,810
But he and Vidur,
the maid's offspring...

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,870
These two people

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,640
love these five Pandavs
a lot.

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,710
Always remember

66
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,840
that they are
not your brothers

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,680
but your enemies.

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,640
Enemies!

69
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,990
May God give you patience
and faith, child.

70
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,730
Grandsire

71
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,830
these are
my five sons.

72
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
I've brought them here

73
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,730
for your guardianship.
- No, Kunti

74
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,950
please don't say that.

75
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,730
They are not outsiders.

76
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,900
This is rightfully their home.

77
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,760
Come.

78
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,730
May you have a long life.

79
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,690
May you have a long life.

80
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,890
May God bless you, Kunti.

81
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,870
May God bless your children too.

82
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,700
May you have a long life.

83
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,790
Greetings.

84
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,700
May you have a long life.

85
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,630
Your Majesty

86
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,890
it's time for your sister-in-law
to enter the temple.

87
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,700
The priests are waiting
for her.

88
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,660
Let's go, Kunti.

89
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,890
The attendants will take
the children into the palace.

90
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,730
Before entering the palace,
even you have to

91
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,660
perform the purgation ceremony

92
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
and then, the ritual
of entering the temple.

93
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,760
Let's go, Kunti.

94
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,730
Bheem, stop making fun of him.

95
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,600
Get up, attendant. It's Bheem's
habit to make everyone laugh.

96
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,630
Call your companion wrestler.
- Come here.

97
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,530
It's the Prince's order.

98
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,700
Are you a wrestler, attendant?
- Yes, Prince.

99
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,730
I'm a wrestler from Magadh.

100
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,720
I live in the residence
for Magadhis.

101
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,590
If I come to your place

102
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,560
will you give me some lessons
in wrestling?

103
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,760
But, Prince, the princes
who belong to this place

104
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,700
don't follow
our style of wrestling.

105
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,560
We do it in a lively
and rural style.

106
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,530
We apply oil and soil
to our bodies.

107
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,650
Attaining that knowledge
is also important.

108
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,560
What if we ever
have to wrestle in Magadh?

109
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,700
Where will I get an expert
master like you?

110
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,530
Attendants,
you have finally come.

111
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,500
Hurry up.
Bring our footwear.

112
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,390
At the orders of His Excellency

113
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,650
we're now attending
to these princes, Prince.

114
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm not talking to you!

115
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,390
I'm talking to these
five attendants.

116
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,430
The ones who are friends
with the servants

117
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,600
are servants themselves.

118
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,560
Come on...
Greet us!

119
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,390
Of course.

120
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,530
Nakul and Sahadev,
Dushashan is elder to you.

121
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,430
Greet him.

122
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,360
It's a must for the younger ones
to greet the elders.

123
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,550
It's not the matter
of being elder.

124
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,590
It's about superiority
and inferiority.

125
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,590
The sons of King Dhritarashtra
never greet anyone

126
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,400
rather, everyone else greets us.

127
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,530
All five of you will greet
the 100 of us right now

128
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,490
and forever after!

129
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,490
Pay your respect
to the sons of the King.

130
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,500
Even we are the sons
of the King.

131
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,420
Their father was the King
of the woods.

132
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,290
He used to rule over animals
and birds.

133
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,450
The coronation ceremony
in Hastinapur

134
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,330
was conducted for our father.

135
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,420
If you have a doubt

136
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,350
then enquire about it.
- Bheem, don't argue.

137
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,420
We will definitely greet you

138
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,450
but I hope you are aware
of the fact

139
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,360
that the one who doesn't
have the right to be greeted

140
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,500
becomes a sinner
if he is greeted.

141
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Doesn't the Prince have
the right to be greeted?

142
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,290
There's only one prince
in the kingdom.

143
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,520
And there is only one prince

144
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,290
and that's me.

145
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,490
My younger brothers will greet
all of you

146
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:17,520
but before that

147
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,290
Yudhishthir should greet
me first.

148
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,330
Has the coronation ceremony

149
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,290
been conducted for you,
brother Duryodhan?

150
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,290
When?

151
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,390
Durbhiksh will tell us

152
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,300
when his coronation ceremony
as the Prince was conducted.

153
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,330
Attendants, you may go.
- At the order of His Excellency

154
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,430
we're attending to
these princes, Prince.

155
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
We can't leave them here

156
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,200
and we'll have to answer
to their questions.

157
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,390
The coronation ceremony has not
yet been conducted, Bheem.

158
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,320
I don't require a coronation.

159
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,190
It's only my right to be
enthroned as the Prince.

160
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,290
It is my birth right.

161
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,380
Duryodhan

162
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,330
only the presence of clouds
in the sky

163
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,350
doesn't make the earth wet.

164
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,130
The clouds

165
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,160
can be easily blown away
by strong winds

166
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,260
and the same is applicable
to one's rights.

167
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,230
So, intelligent people
do not display their rights

168
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,320
until the appropriate time.

169
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,320
Yudhishthir is the eldest
among you.

170
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,390
First of all,
all of you, greet Yudhishthir.

171
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,260
Pay your respects to him.
It's my order.

172
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,320
Duryodhan!
