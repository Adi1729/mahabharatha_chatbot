1
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,800
'Give this 'Brahmin'
ten cows in charity.'

2
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,670
'The son of Bharadwaj'

3
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,690
'does not accept charity,
Drupad.'

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,640
'If you seek alms
then go ahead.'

5
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,800
'I can write two villages
in your name'

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,830
'on a gold parchment.'

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,740
'But if you talk about rights'

8
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,690
'you will be
sentenced to death.'

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,800
I have spent my entire life
burning in the fire of revenge.

10
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,800
You had approached me as a
friend to ask for a few cows.

11
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,700
Had I deemed you my friend

12
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,760
this kingdom would
never have got divided.

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,770
I return you your kingdom

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,630
that had been conquered,
friend Drupad.

15
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,630
I have committed a crime
by refusing your friendship

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,700
and its punishment is

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,490
that I should have only
half the kingdom with me.

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,730
Pardon me, friend.

19
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,760
You are to die

20
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,690
at the hands of my son

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,530
and that is fate.

22
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,570
Everyone dies eventually,
friend.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,530
But today, I am happy to know

24
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,660
that when Dhrishtadyumna
will behead me

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,760
it will not be out of anger.

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,500
It will certainly be to save me
from some grave crisis.

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Then it will be best, guru Drona

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,560
if you deem the Prince
to be your son

29
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,470
and impart knowledge to him.

30
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,670
The knowledge imparted by you

31
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,670
will become the medium
of your salvation.

32
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,700
Then it must certainly
be a part of your plan.

33
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,500
That is why, you had

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,400
sent me a message to come here.

35
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,630
Vasudev

36
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,670
I had heard a lot
of your greatness

37
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
but today...

38
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,570
Today, I have seen it
for myself.

39
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,460
No, guru Drona.

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,630
Vasudev

41
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,530
pardon me.

42
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,640
I could not know you.

43
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,420
Your Highness

44
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,470
had you known your daughter's
love and dedication

45
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,590
knowing me would not have
been that difficult.

46
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,490
You have always deemed your
daughters to be your misfortune.

47
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,630
Just look at
Draupadi's greatness.

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,430
Look at her dedication.

49
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,490
Even the Kaumodaki mace
of Vasudev Krishna

50
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,530
was pacified by her.

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Draupadi!

52
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,560
Stop, Draupadi!

53
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,470
Draupadi...

54
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,370
Draupadi.

55
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,460
Let's go inside, Draupadi.

56
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,430
I cannot go inside, sister.

57
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,490
I have been banished
from the city.

58
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,300
Draupadi, come inside
and apologize to father.

59
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,560
I am certain.

60
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,490
He shall certainly pardon you.

61
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,440
If a chariot loses its wheel

62
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,440
the wheel loses its definition.

63
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,340
But even after
a chariot loses its wheel

64
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,540
it is still called a chariot.

65
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,370
A child is identified

66
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,260
by its father's name.

67
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,460
Please do not bring arrogance
into the picture, Draupadi.

68
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,460
This is not arrogance, sister

69
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,530
but the ones who have
no self-respect

70
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,530
they cannot command
respect from others.

71
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,300
And in order
to have self-respect

72
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,300
it is important for me
to know first

73
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,430
what the purpose of my life is

74
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,390
and what my strengths are.

75
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
Goodbye, sister.

76
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,690
Attendant, to honour
Princess Draupadi

77
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,630
make the necessary arrangements
for a grand procession.

78
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,850
Prepare a gold palanquin!

79
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,720
She will enter the royal court

80
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,850
with great pomp and show!

81
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,690
Where is Draupadi?!

82
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,590
Where is she?

83
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,590
Father

84
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,620
Draupadi has decided
to leave Kampilya.

85
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,720
Impossible.

86
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,680
Impossible.
My...

87
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,760
My daughter cannot
renounce her kingdom.

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,850
She must certainly be unaware

89
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,590
that today, because
of Vasudev Krishna

90
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,580
I have had a change
of heart, Shikhandini!

91
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,690
S-She must not have gone far.

92
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,660
I shall go and bring her back!

93
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,750
Your Highness

94
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,680
let me

95
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,590
accomplish this task.

96
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,780
Princess Draupadi.

97
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Princess

98
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,720
tell me what you did exactly.

99
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,550
W-Which mantra did you use?

100
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,490
Share that knowledge
with me, Princess.

101
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,680
Help me better myself.

102
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,590
I did not use any mantra.

103
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,490
No, you certainly did.

104
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,720
You pacified my magical
Kaumodaki mace!

105
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,580
How?

106
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,490
You must... You must
teach me that mantra

107
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,490
otherwise...

108
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,690
Otherwise I will jump off
the cliff and kill myself

109
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,550
and you will be
responsible for it.

110
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,720
Stop!

111
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,530
I did not use any mantra.

112
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,650
I had gone there
only to protect my father.

113
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,660
I do not believe you.

114
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,650
Without the knowledge of mantras

115
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,420
you could never
have protected him.

116
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,620
I am leaving.
- But I can

117
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,520
certainly brave the weapon
being charged at him.

118
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,460
In other words, you had

119
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,390
used the mantra of love.

120
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,620
Then I need not fear.

121
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,420
Everyone knows
the mantra of love

122
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,590
but no one is able to use it.

123
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,590
Now, if you wish
to jump off the cliff

124
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,590
you are free to do so.
Go right ahead.

125
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
I do not wish
to jump off the cliff.

126
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,320
I am merely looking for
the answers to some questions.

127
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,490
What is the importance
of my birth?

128
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,480
What is the purpose of my life?

129
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,200
To make my father accept

130
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,130
and respect me

131
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,290
what must I do?

132
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,230
So many questions!

133
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,270
And all of them
are worthless.

134
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,270
Your question should be

135
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,320
as to who you are.

136
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,230
If you know yourself

137
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,270
then you will get
all the answers.

138
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,270
Who am I?

139
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Every person is an image
of the Almighty

140
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,260
but no one knows this.

141
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,100
In ash are hidden embers

142
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,030
and in ignorance...

143
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,290
In ignorance is hidden the soul.

144
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,190
And the one who is
unable to see himself

145
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,130
has the desire
of others to see him.

146
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,160
We wish other people to tell us

147
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,230
what we are
and who we are.

148
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,130
But others are surrounded
by their own ignorance.

149
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,070
And the one who
does not know himself

150
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,070
cannot tell us who we are.

151
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,070
In order to know who I am
what must I do?

152
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,160
You must bear righteousness

153
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,030
and in order to
re-establish righteousness

154
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,220
you must make
the necessary efforts.

155
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,160
But how will I
know righteousness?

156
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,190
Before knowing righteousness

157
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,130
you need to know its bases.

158
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,160
Righteousness has five bases

159
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,000
knowledge, love

160
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,100
justice, dedication

161
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,960
and patience.

162
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,960
Did you not ask me, Draupadi

163
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,090
why you were born?

164
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,160
You have been born to acquire
the five bases of righteousness.

165
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,100
The Gods have said

166
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,960
that you will build the
future of the Aryan region.

167
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,900
You will help
re-establish righteousness

168
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,060
in the entire world.

169
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,160
And this will only be possible

170
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,930
when these five bases

171
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,100
namely

172
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,030
knowledge, love

173
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,900
justice
dedication and

174
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,900
patience will be
acquired by you.

175
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,120
Shall we go now?

176
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,070
Life is waiting
for you, Draupadi.

177
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,000
Who are you truly?

178
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,830
Me?

179
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,000
I am the protector of cows.

180
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,060
My friends call me Govind.*
*Among his most common names are Mohan "enchanter", Govinda, "Finder of the cows", or Gopala, "Protector of the cows".

181
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,030
'Krishna, my Krishna.'

182
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,860
'The one who lifted the Govardhan* was Krishna.'
*He lifted the Govardhana hill and prevent the devastation of its pasture land by Indra.

183
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,990
'The one with
a peacock feather...'

184
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,800
Answer a question
of mine, Govind.

185
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,830
Did I truly

186
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,890
pacify that mace?

187
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,000
What do you think, Draupadi?

188
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,760
You had pacified it.

189
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,930
But it had been
pacified for you.

190
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,870
That is why,
the credit goes to you.

191
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,920
Shall we go now

192
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,800
friend?

193
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,760
Why is it taking
so long, Hidimba?

194
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,700
I am almost done
luring them, brother.

195
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,830
Bring them to the village
as soon as possible!

196
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,830
I have promised the ogres

197
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,660
that after years,
they shall have

198
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,760
tasty human meat.

199
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,600
Everyone is awaiting them
back in the village!

200
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,860
Bring them there
as soon as possible!

201
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,830
Come here...

202
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,790
Closer...
