1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,520
Please

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,720
marry my eldest brother.

3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,580
By presiding over
the throne of Hastinapur

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,560
please work for the welfare
of its subjects.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,520
Your radiance
and your glory

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,720
will illuminate the entire
Aryan region in the future.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,550
What about you, Prince?

8
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,590
We four brothers
will resort to asceticism.

9
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,460
Out of the five brothers,
four must resort to asceticism.

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,610
In this strange situation

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,620
we five brothers
cannot coexist together.

12
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,660
Is this the solution you
came up with in this situation

13
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,510
Prince Arjun?

14
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,460
In other words, you will give
the fruit of your competence

15
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,560
to someone else as charity.

16
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,550
Did King Karna of Anga
not wish to do the same?

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,490
But he was prohibited to do so.

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,580
Then how can you
have the right to do so?

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
And what about
my honour, Prince?

20
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,360
The world will laugh at me

21
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,610
that when I found out

22
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,350
that only the eldest son
has the right to the throne

23
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,580
I decided to deem
someone else my husband.

24
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,320
What am I, Prince?

25
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,480
A woman who loves a man
only for property?

26
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,550
When a tree burns

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,320
the climber wrapped around it
also burns to ashes.

28
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,360
It does not change its basis.

29
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,510
Am I inferior
to even that climber?

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,510
If you agree with me

31
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,520
then it shall not be deemed

32
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,480
your selfishness
but sacrifice, Princess.

33
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,550
No one will speak ill of you.

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,480
Prince even Goddess Sita
was spoken ill of.

35
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,360
Then how can I be spared?

36
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,380
Then answer this question
of mine, Prince.

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,410
I will make the sacrifice.

38
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,480
You will make the sacrifice.

39
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,290
Three of your brothers
will make the sacrifice.

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,460
Will the burden
of so many sacrifices

41
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,420
let your eldest brother live?

42
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Then, Princess

43
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,480
you should return
to your father.

44
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,250
Invalidate the 'swayamvar.'

45
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,310
You have the right to do so.
- And after that...

46
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,320
Who will marry me?

47
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,450
I have heard the tale of Amba,
the Princess of Kashi, Prince.

48
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,380
Should I also follow her path

49
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,290
and go beg before Kings
and ask for justice?

50
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,280
And in the end

51
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,250
the fire of dejection
will burn me to ashes.

52
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,310
Has the royal family
of Hastinapur

53
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,390
taken an oath to torch
the maidens of the Aryan region

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,420
Prince?!

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,190
Pardon me, Princess.

56
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,150
If the four brothers of mine

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,320
resort to asceticism
because of me

58
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,120
then its burden

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
will crush our married life.

60
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,320
I see no solution
to this situation.

61
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,220
Pardon us.

62
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,250
'These five stones...'

63
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,050
'These are the fives bases
of righteousness, Draupadi.'

64
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,020
'There are many instances
in one's life, Draupadi'

65
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,180
'when one is unable
to see the path.'

66
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,150
'In order to remind
oneself of righteousness'

67
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,020
'one requires an object.'

68
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,250
'The decision will always
be yours, Draupadi.'

69
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,150
'But taking a decision bearing
righteousness in mind'

70
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,250
'will be easier.'

71
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,180
We cannot let this injustice
happen to Princess Draupadi

72
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,190
mother.

73
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,060
We must face
the punishment for it.

74
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,950
Lady.

75
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Draupadi.

76
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,220
Dear, my sons have found
a way out of this situation.

77
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,120
You will not face
any form of injustice.

78
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,990
You and Arjun will get married.

79
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
But before that

80
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,890
the rest of my sons
will resort to asceticism.

81
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,050
Asceticism is the
path of courage, lady.

82
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
It is not a refuge when
running away from problems.

83
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,910
Who will benefit from
the asceticism of your sons?

84
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,940
And Prince Bheem is married.

85
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,850
Why should his first wife
be punished so?

86
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,950
There is no other
solution, dear.

87
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,820
When a woman gets married

88
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,820
she enters her new home

89
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,050
with the hope to become
that family's good fortune.

90
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,110
How can I bring misfortune
to King Pandu's

91
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,080
family and his lineage, lady?

92
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,880
Unknowingly, you

93
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,850
have divided me
amongst your five sons.

94
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,950
I deem your mistake

95
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,050
my destiny.

96
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,920
I...

97
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,790
I will marry your five sons.

98
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,470
I will marry your five sons.

99
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,490
Impossible.
- Impossible!

100
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,300
What did you say, Draupadi?

101
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,370
Have these 'Brahmins'
planned to divide you?

102
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,330
How did such a terrible thought
stem in their minds?!

103
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,260
Is this the competence
of this 'Brahmin?!'

104
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,330
The divinely fragrant
sandalwood tree

105
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,390
is home to venomous serpents!

106
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,300
I had heard of such a thing!

107
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,370
Today, I have seen it myself!

108
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,340
We have no such plan,
Your Highness.

109
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Pardon us.

110
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,300
Fate worked in such...
- Be quiet, 'Brahmin!'

111
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,200
Otherwise I shall lose the fear
of killing a 'Brahmin.'

112
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,200
The royal family of Panchal
shall protect its Princess.

113
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,300
I do not accept this marriage.

114
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Let's go, daughter.

115
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,170
Father

116
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
if a maiden won in a 'swayamvar'

117
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,100
stays with her father

118
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,100
then you will be humiliated.

119
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,260
And so will I.

120
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,130
That will not be humiliation

121
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,360
but the blessing
of Lord Surya himself.

122
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,190
Daughter, one would have
been humiliated

123
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,170
had his daughter not been
welcomed in his home.

124
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,300
How did this happen, sons?

125
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,240
How could I commit
such a grave mistake?

126
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,100
I have ruined a maiden's life

127
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,170
by giving her lifelong insult.

128
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,240
Joy, sorrow, respect, insult

129
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,070
life and death.

130
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,330
If you can give all this, Kunti

131
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,200
then what does the Almighty do?

132
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,100
Lord Vedvyas!

133
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,030
Greetings.

134
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,090
Greetings.

135
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,160
There would come
a time in your lives

136
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,070
when you would not know
what the righteous path is.

137
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,070
I knew of it.

138
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,220
That is why

139
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,170
I have come here
from Kampilya, Kunti.

140
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,160
Lord Vedvyas

141
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,000
greetings.

142
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,060
No one knows more about
righteousness than you

143
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,000
in the entire world.

144
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,030
You have classified the 'Vedas'
into four segments.

145
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,100
Oh Great Sage, answer us.

146
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,160
What would be correct and
appropriate in this situation?

147
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,030
Your name is Yudhishthir.

148
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,970
It means being steady
in testing times.

149
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,230
Being steady in testing times
is in your nature, child.

150
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,000
Then how can you
be so perturbed?

151
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,960
When life is spinning
out of control

152
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,160
it is essential
to calm oneself down.

153
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,240
Let's meditate
over this situation.
