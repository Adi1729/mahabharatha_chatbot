1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,100
I have lost all my pride.
So, I quit the game.

2
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,130
Emperor Yudhishthir

3
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,160
you are the supreme Emperor.

4
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,260
Hastinapur has taken your refuge

5
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,130
and I am the commander-in-chief
of Hastinapur.

6
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,250
In other words

7
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,270
your words are my command.

8
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
Just

9
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,000
order me to release
your younger brothers

10
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,990
and I shall have them freed,
immediately.

11
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,990
And if

12
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,030
you order me to punish anyone

13
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,060
then even that order shall be
executed immediately.

14
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,060
Your Highness...

15
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,190
Your Highness,
I have been defeated.

16
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,130
I have been defeated!

17
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,120
Despite winning the game of dice

18
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,930
I have lost the game of life,
Your Highness.

19
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,190
I have lost the game of life.

20
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,190
Now, I shall accept
any punishment you award me.

21
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,030
You shall not be punished,
uncle.

22
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,090
I pardon you

23
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,970
and brother Duryodhan.

24
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,100
How, Your Highness?
How?

25
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,090
How can you have

26
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,050
such a pardoning heart?

27
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,030
What is the force

28
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,070
that keeps your heart so steady?

29
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,960
Life is nothing

30
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,960
but a war,
Your Highness

31
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,090
and in this war called life

32
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,070
you always remain steady.

33
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,900
How, Your Highness?
How?

34
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,970
Irradiate the way of an ignorant
person like me, Your Highness.

35
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,020
Get up,
King of Gandhar.

36
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,870
It is a simple path,
King of Gandhar.

37
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,930
Everyone knows about
righteousness and truth

38
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,060
and I have never renounced
either of the two.

39
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,090
This is what leaves me
contented.

40
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,860
Contentment?

41
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,890
No, Your Highness.

42
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,860
We do not want contentment.

43
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,890
I

44
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,070
Crown Prince Duryodhan

45
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,860
and King Ashwatthama

46
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,990
do not want contentment,
Your Highness.

47
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,990
We do not want contentment.

48
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,900
We want the society
to look at us

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,960
and put its hands together

50
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,970
to treat us with honour

51
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,820
and respect us.

52
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,870
A beggar has his gaze

53
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,000
fixed on the sacrament,
Your Highness

54
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,020
and not on the idol
of the Almighty.

55
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,890
We are destitute from our souls,
Your Highness.

56
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,860
From our souls...

57
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,860
We are not looking
for contentment

58
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,930
but pride and honour instead.

59
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,800
But Your Highness

60
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,760
how can

61
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,920
being righteous be something
to take pride in?

62
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,990
How?

63
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,800
Righteousness is the driver
of actions, King of Gandhar.

64
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,930
One who has not
renounced righteousness

65
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,800
nor given up being truthful

66
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,760
requires nobody's approval
to take pride in oneself.

67
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,960
Mango is sweet by nature,
King of Gandhar.

68
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,870
It does not require sugar.

69
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,660
Your Highness

70
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,800
you never lie, do you?

71
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,790
Despite facing
numerous challenges

72
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,660
you did not renounce
righteousness.

73
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,790
Despite losing all your brothers

74
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,790
you stood by truthfulness.

75
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,860
Since you are a righteous man

76
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,630
with a heart filled
with righteousness

77
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,600
you take pride in yourself

78
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,700
because the truth is

79
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,690
there is no greater pride

80
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,630
than righteousness

81
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,600
in the entire world!

82
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,700
You are correct,
King of Gandhar.

83
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,790
But brother Yudhishthir

84
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,790
you had told brother Bheem that
you were ashamed of yourself

85
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,730
and that there was
no pride in losing us.

86
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,530
Absolutely, Nakul

87
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,630
but a human heart
is not all that simple.

88
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,770
I have never renounced
righteousness

89
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,630
and I take pride in it.

90
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,560
Then be seated,
Your Highness.

91
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,530
The game of dice
has not concluded yet.

92
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,460
Brother...

93
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,590
May the Emperor be happy!

94
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,590
Now, I shall bet

95
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,560
myself against you,
in this round.

96
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,180
May the Empress be happy.

97
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,010
What happened,
maid?

98
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,020
The Emperor has
bet himself this time

99
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,180
and I am afraid
that he will be defeated.

100
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,020
What kind of a treachery
is this?

101
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,120
When a tree
is struck with lightning

102
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,980
the top of the tree
is the first to burn.

103
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,020
Why are men on key positions,
like grandsire and Guru Drona

104
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,950
not getting burnt
with wrath, there?

105
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,920
Why is no one saying anything?

106
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,990
May the Empress be happy.

107
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,110
Vrushali

108
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,080
you...

109
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,140
Your Highness

110
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,880
I... I request you

111
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,140
to leave with the accompanying
army of Indraprastha

112
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,110
to the city of Ahichhatra,* immediately.
*The ancient capital of Northern Panchala taken over by Drona, near Ramnagar village in Uttar Pradesh state. Ahi means snake or Naga (serpent worshippers), khsetra means region.

113
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,910
Your brother Dhrishtadyumna

114
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,140
will certainly
protect you there.

115
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,140
Protect me?

116
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,080
You are a fool!

117
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,080
I am aware of the environment
prevailing here, Your Highness.

118
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,080
All this treachery

119
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,910
is intended to insult you.

120
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,920
If the Emperor gets defeated

121
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,920
then you shall
require protection.

122
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,920
Despite having the five most
competent Aryan warriors

123
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,950
as my husbands

124
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,820
will I have to seek
the protection of my brother?

125
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,020
Pardon me,
Your Highness

126
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,080
but pride defines competence.

127
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,850
When one loses one's pride

128
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,020
how can he be competent?

129
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,950
Uncle!

130
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,050
Slave, take that crown off!

131
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,790
And a slave
does not have the right

132
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,690
to grace a throne of gold.

133
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,780
I am the Lord of Indraprastha!

134
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,880
Now, the supreme Emperor
of the Aryan region

135
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,670
is me!
Me!

136
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Attendant

137
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,620
go to the wife
of these five slaves

138
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,750
and order her to present
herself here!

139
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,190
Go to the wife
of these five slaves

140
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,290
and order her to present
herself here!

141
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,250
Impossible!

142
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,220
If Panchali is
insulted in this court

143
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,350
then there will be
a bloodbath here!

144
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,190
Bheem has

145
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,310
already broken his mace,
slave Arjun

146
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
and your Gandiva

147
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,260
belongs to King Karna of Anga.

148
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,310
Then what bloodshed?

149
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,210
Duryodhan!

150
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,150
There are only
two duties in my life!

151
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,320
First is to protect my family

152
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,310
and the other is to obey the
orders of brother Yudhishthir!

153
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,110
So, in order for
a bloodbath to take place

154
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,110
these hands of mine
are more than adequate!

155
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,310
Calm down,
Bheem.

156
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,140
Duryodhan!

157
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,120
A person being enslaved
certainly does not imply

158
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
that everyone has
the right to his wife.

159
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,180
This is Hastinapur

160
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,050
and justice reigns supreme here!

161
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,110
Draupadi is the daughter
of my friend.

162
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,120
She is like a daughter to me.

163
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,050
Do not insult her,
Duryodhan

164
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,150
else, with my presence here

165
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,250
for her protection

166
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,050
she need not await the arrival
of anyone from Ahichhatra.

167
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,190
We shall certainly
not insult the Empress.

168
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,140
We shall certainly not do that,
Great Guru Drona.

169
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,090
My darling

170
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,110
do not be foolish.

171
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,180
Had the mere defeat
of Yudhishthir

172
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,220
given you the right
to his family

173
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,110
there would have been no need

174
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,020
to defeat the five brothers
individually, in the game.

175
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,960
We could have defeated
Yudhishthir in the first round.

176
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,990
Right?

177
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,180
You do not have the right
over the Empress, yet.

178
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,150
For that

179
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,080
you'll have to win the Empress
in the game of dice!
