1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,350
Are you a Knight or 
a coward?

2
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,790
Bheem, be prepared to die.

3
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,000
Those who do not fear death is
true knight, you're stupid.

4
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,010
Think of your sins and ask 
forgiveness to God.

5
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,040
You never do good in this life.
Perhaps you will be reborn...

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,450
May you...be better
in the next life.

7
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,780
Bheem!

8
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,570
Dusshasan, in a duel between 
mature Knights...

9
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,020
Immatured knight should 
not interfere.

10
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,710
Keep stalling any longer, friend.

11
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,020
Brother Bheem is not yet winning.

12
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,020
Get up, Duryodhan!

13
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,020
Come on, get up!
Quickly, Duryodhan!

14
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,930
Give up Yudhishthir.

15
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,890
I can not give myself 
to you, Grandsire.

16
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:44,000
But in this duel I will try 
to beat you.

17
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,780
Yudhishthir I do not want 
to kill you.

18
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,610
Give up,

19
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,350
and I will take you to Duryodhan.

20
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,220
It will end this war, 
my son.

21
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,230
Is Duryodhan to stay alive
to see it, Grandsire?

22
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,640
This is why I hate this war, 
brother Bheem.

23
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:31,310
To crush you under my feet.

24
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,860
Come on, get up!

25
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,260
Why are you lying on the ground like 
a tail insect, brother Bheem.

26
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,270
Get up, if you have the courage.

27
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,270
Come on, get up!

28
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,940
Hit me. 
Get up.

29
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,950
Your enemy's right in front of you. 
Get up!

30
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,890
Get up, brother Bheem.
Get up!

31
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,230
Get up.
Come on, brother Bheem.

32
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,740
Brother Bheem!
Get up!

33
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,740
You are our pride.
Get up, brother Bheem.

34
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,710
Heeyah!

35
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,750
Mark and remember my vow, 
Duryodhan!

36
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,530
You ordered to undress Draupadi.

37
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:04,770
First I will pull your tongue and then 
crush your head.

38
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,440
It's impossible.
It's not possible, brother Bheem.

39
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,280
I am the Crown Prince.

40
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,350
King of Hastinapur, Dhristarasta's 
not here.

41
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,950
So I'm in power here.

42
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:34,030
The right to imprison and kill me is only in the hands of your brother Yudhishthir.

43
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,910
You're stupid, Duryodhan.

44
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,310
Didn't you get authority over the kingdom in uncle's absence.

45
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,380
Then I had authority over the kingdom in my brother's absence as well.

46
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,390
And as the Crown Prince I have 
the right to punish you.

47
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,990
This is why Vasudev told brother 
to head to Hastinapur.

48
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,430
So you will not get 
Grandfather's protection.

49
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah!

50
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,610
'Come on, let's get intimate.'

51
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,940
'Come here, servant Draupadi.'
'Sit on my lap.'

52
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,960
'Dusshasan, remove the clothes.'

53
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,360
Prince Bheem!

54
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,990
Your king is in my hands.

55
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,660
And without his permission you can't 
attack Prince Duryodhan.

56
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,440
Ha...ha...ha...

57
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,280
And if he ordered you to 
kill Prince Duryodhan,

58
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm going to kill him.

59
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,890
Bheem!

60
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:48,300
If I die, the war will end today.

61
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,910
Kill Duryodhan,

62
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,310
and let Grandsire kills me.

63
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:11,250
To restore peace in Aryavrat, I'm ready to sacrifice my life.

64
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,270
Strike, Bheem!
The sun will set soon!

65
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,370
Strike, Bheem!

66
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,760
My dear!

67
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,780
Sanjay...

68
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,360
Sanjay, why are you silent?

69
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,890
What happened to my son?

70
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,370
What is going on with Duryodhan?
Quick, tell me!

71
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,820
Majesty,

72
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:03,830
Bheem has assaulted Prince Duryodhan 
with his mace.

73
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,850
He attacked Duryodhan!

74
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,860
King Yudhishthir is under threat of 
his excellency Bhishma's spear.

75
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:24,850
Brother Bheem, to win you must 
have more eagerness.

76
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,680
Unless you can let go of your attachment.

77
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:39,330
Your duty, your brothers and 
also your family,

78
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:48,340
You will remain bound to them, and victory will always be away from you.

79
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,220
And attachment will only bring 
defeat, brother Bheem.

80
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,220
Just defeat.

81
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,730
My duty, my brothers,

82
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,240
and my family is my courage, 
Duryodhan.

83
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,010
And the day when you have to 
face my courage again...

84
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:33,260
It will be your last day, 
Duryodhan!

85
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:41,270
Your last day!
It will soon arrive!

86
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,240
The war is over for today, 
Majesty.

87
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,680
Pandavas had won the war today, Majesty.

88
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,760
But...

89
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,760
uncle did not let their 
victory complete.

90
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,770
He saved my son Duryodhan from Bheem.

91
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,780
Wait and see, Sanjay!

92
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,380
Until uncle in charge in the battleground,

93
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,210
sons of Pandu will not win.

94
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,310
Sons of Pandu's victory is very unlikely.

95
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,240
Our victory today is priceless, 
Emperor Yudhishthir.

96
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,750
Our army courage and spirit 
have increased manifold.

97
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,440
Now they believe that under 
your leadership,

98
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,580
and Vasudev Krishna
we are surely will win.

99
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,260
We achieve victory today.

100
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,930
But Grandsire experience
have beaten us.

101
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,930
No.

102
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,930
Brother Yudhishthir did not fight 
with all his might.

103
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,620
However, Madhav.

104
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,310
Grandsire has a boon to die 
as he wishes.

105
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,790
It is impossible to kill him.

106
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,350
He probably got the boon but it doesn't 
have to be at his will.

107
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,370
It is possible to severely hurt him.

108
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,970
That will cause him can't 
continue this war, friend.

109
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,320
It is also not possible, Vasudev.

110
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,320
Grandsire is the epitome of chastity.

111
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,320
We will not be able
to attack him.

112
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,260
Nobody's that holy, brother Bheem.

113
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,270
Neither the acacia tree nor 
the sandalwood.

114
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,280
When dried, they are ready to burn.

115
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,280
It is a law of nature.

116
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,280
Anyone who tread the road of 
Kaurava's punishment,

117
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,290
must still be destroyed.
