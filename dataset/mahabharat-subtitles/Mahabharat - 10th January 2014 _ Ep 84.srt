1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,420
The Gods have showered their
blessings upon us, King Drupad.

2
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,330
In exchange for our merits

3
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,420
they have blessed you
with a son.

4
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,350
It is now time

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,390
to obtain the great blessing

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,300
which is a part of your destiny.

7
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,390
For the birth of your daughter

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,320
make the sacrifices,
Your Highness!

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,160
I am not a fool, great sage.

10
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,350
I wanted a son

11
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,390
and I have got one.

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,260
Now, I do not wish
to sacrifice anything.

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,160
Let's go, son.

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,260
Stop! King Drupad!

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,320
The maiden born
from this 'yajna'

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,260
is the fate of the Aryan region!

17
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,360
You must accept her!

18
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,130
No woman can ever be
a person's fate, great sage.

19
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,160
A father never obtains
anything from his daughter.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,150
Let's go, son.

21
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,230
You are a fool, Drupad!

22
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,220
One obtains love
from one's daughter!

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,230
One obtains respect
from one's daughter!

24
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,250
One obtains righteousness
from one's daughter!

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,150
Do not forget, King Drupad

26
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,190
that a son bestows only
his family with righteousness!

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,290
But a daughter blesses
the future generations

28
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,350
and the entire world
with righteousness!

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,230
All that is good in the world

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,160
is obtained only from
a daughter, Drupad!

31
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,000
The wrath of the Gods
is increasing, Drupad!

32
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,220
Do not be foolish!

33
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,090
Come back for the 'yajna!'

34
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,030
Stop, Drupad!

35
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
You will not be able to leave
this 'yajna' incomplete!

36
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,060
And the Gods will not
permit you to leave.

37
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,120
What will the Gods give me

38
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,090
by forcing me
to make a sacrifice?!

39
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,060
What will they give me?!

40
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,930
Then I shall make a sacrifice!

41
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,990
Do the Gods wish to bless
the entire world through me?!

42
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,890
Then I

43
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,060
ask for lifelong struggle
for my daughter!

44
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,960
I ask for pain!

45
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,930
What are you asking for,
Drupad?!

46
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,050
How can you ask for pain
for your own daughter?!

47
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Why not?

48
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,090
With pain and struggles does
the best of character get built!

49
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,020
May her character be as pure and fair as this 'abeer.'*
*A dye (dry powder) from flower extracts.

50
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,050
May she have all the
impurities of the world!

51
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,860
Yet the world
must deem her pure!

52
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,820
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?!

53
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,890
Like this wheat,
may she have the strength

54
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,050
to give courage to others!

55
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,930
May she keep facing situations

56
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,830
that can damage the morale
of any person.

57
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,760
Yet she must remain courageous

58
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,890
and give courage to others.

59
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,890
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?!

60
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,900
This 'gulaal'* never changes its colour!
*Colored powder solutions thrown during Holi/the festival of colors or the festival of love.

61
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,900
May she have
such steadfast valour.

62
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,950
Can I get such a daughter?!

63
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,900
Nothing is more beautiful in the world than this 'kumkum'* here.
*Powder used for social and religious markings--made from turmeric or saffron.

64
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,860
Just like this 'kumkum,'
may my daughter

65
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,760
be the most beautiful woman
in this world!

66
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,700
And may she reflect
the beauty of others as well.

67
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,790
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?!

68
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
These flowers here...

69
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,700
When flowers are crushed,
they emit fragrance.

70
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,790
May she face injustice
time and again!

71
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,760
Yet she must spread
the fragrance of justice!

72
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Can the Gods give me
such a daughter?

73
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,640
To carry out the wishes
of the Gods

74
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
is why this maiden
has been born, Drupad!

75
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,710
Take good care of her!

76
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,770
You have never had anything
precious like her before

77
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,740
and neither will you ever have!

78
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,700
King Drupad

79
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,840
this maiden will change
the future of the Aryan region.

80
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,840
She will create a new history!

81
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,770
This is your daughter, Drupad!

82
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,840
The Gods have named her Krishna.*
*One of darker complexion.

83
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,640
Since she is born from a 'yajna'

84
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,640
she shall be called Yajnaseni!

85
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,710
The world will remember you
by her name!

86
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,780
She shall be called Draupadi!

87
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,620
Bless you!

88
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,470
With the brilliance
of fire on the face

89
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,470
with the heat of fire
in the breath

90
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,490
and with the purity of fire
in the heart was born

91
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,460
your daughter, father.

92
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,460
I place the boon of the Gods
at your feet.
