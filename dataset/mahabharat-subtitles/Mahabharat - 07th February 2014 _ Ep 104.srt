1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
Arjun.

2
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,330
Uncle

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,250
that is Arjun.

4
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,320
My dear

5
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,430
those four young 'Brahmins...'

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,390
They are his brothers.

7
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,290
My dear

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,230
h-how are those

9
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,460
five people alive?

10
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,320
Today, your fate

11
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,290
stands at a very
dangerous point.

12
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,350
Bheem

13
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,230
if the five of us
are seen together

14
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,370
then everyone will know
who we are.

15
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,320
But brother Yudhishthir

16
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,360
is it not the time
to reveal ourselves?

17
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,430
That decision can be taken
only by mother, Sahadev

18
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,390
and not us.

19
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,330
Bheem.
- Yes.

20
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,190
You must stay with Arjun.
The rest of us shall leave.

21
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,230
We shall wait for you
outside the city.

22
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,230
On my behalf,
you must bless Arjun

23
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,230
and the Princess.
- Do wait for a while, brother.

24
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,290
Just look at how excited
the 'Brahmins' are.

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,360
And Nakul might just get married
to one of their daughters.

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,220
Yes, Bheem.
That too is one of the fears.

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,130
And Nakul might just
not be able to refuse

28
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,290
a marriage proposal like you.

29
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,060
Bless you.

30
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,060
Father

31
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,960
allow your daughter

32
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,070
to leave with her good fortune.

33
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,100
My dear, if a swan enters
the territory of crows

34
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,990
then all the crows

35
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,000
peck that swan to death.

36
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,790
What do you mean?

37
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,130
With the help of all the Kings

38
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,990
and 'Kshatriyas' present here

39
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,030
we need to have
Arjun killed today.

40
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,030
What kind of
a mockery is this?!

41
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,020
What kind of
an insult is it, Kings?

42
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,890
Can the might of the
'Kshatriyas' of the Aryan region

43
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,800
be insulted in this manner
in the city of Panchal?!

44
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,990
We are 'Kshatriyas!'

45
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,060
We are protectors of the land.

46
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,890
We are nourishers
of the subjects!

47
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,000
The maiden who was
gifted to us by the Gods

48
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,800
will be taken by that
destitute 'Brahmin?'

49
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,990
Destitute 'Brahmin.'

50
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,760
If a mouse steals a gem
from an elephant's crown

51
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,000
then that does not denote
the greatness of the rodent!

52
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,970
The elephant...
The elephant!

53
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,830
It is the elephant's insult!

54
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,870
Today, as the Princess
got married

55
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,860
to that destitute 'Brahmin'

56
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,960
all the Princesses
of the Aryan region

57
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,960
and the 'Kshatriya' maidens

58
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,870
will henceforth,
renounce all the Kings

59
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,930
and marry such
destitute 'Brahmins.'

60
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
How many times
should we be insulted?!

61
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,830
Pick them up!

62
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,760
Pick up your weapons!

63
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,930
And put an end to this 'Brahmin'

64
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,690
and his family.

65
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,930
And punish
the impudent Princess!

66
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,830
Kill that 'Brahmin!'

67
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,930
And throw the maiden
into the fire!

68
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,620
Friend.

69
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,730
Do not fight with
Arjun today, friend.

70
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,660
What are you saying,
King of Anga?

71
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,820
The enemy is standing
right before us!

72
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,670
And the enemy has displayed
great valour today, friend.

73
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,860
When lightning strikes

74
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,620
even Chandra Dev hides behind
the clouds momentarily

75
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,690
to honour it.

76
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,700
If we do not honour
someone's competence

77
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,670
then how will we
take pride in ours, friend?

78
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,790
If you ask me to

79
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,800
then I shall take to arms

80
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,590
but I will not be able
to kill Arjun today, friend.

81
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,650
'Kshatriyas'

82
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,790
we must kill this
'Brahmin' today!

83
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,830
If so many 'Kshatriya' Kings

84
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,830
kill us 'Brahmins'

85
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,630
then they will commit
the sin of killing 'Brahmins.'

86
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,630
You have taken to arms!

87
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,660
To fight you and kill you...

88
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,630
...is our right!

89
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,670
Quit talking, Kings! Attack!
- Attack!

90
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,920
Patukeshwar

91
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,920
why do you not challenge
the King of Gandhar to a fight?

92
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,910
King of Gandhar, where are you?!

93
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,860
Show yourself! I will
behead him this instant!

94
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,790
King of Gandhar!

95
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,010
Patukeshwar, this way.

96
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,880
This way...
King of Gandhar!

97
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,890
You want to fight, correct?
Come here!

98
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,890
You must fight me first.
Come here!

99
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,720
Come here!
Make haste!

100
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,780
My dear

101
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,980
go and kill Arjun and Bheem.

102
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,720
The rest of them
will perish on their own.

103
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,980
Do not ponder, my dear.

104
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,950
This is your opportunity.

105
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,880
Pick up your weapon.

106
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Not today...

107
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,540
Today, you may
savour your victory.

108
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,650
You will certainly get to meet
Lord Yama someday.

109
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,710
Let that

110
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,680
'Brahmin' know this.

111
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,740
Crown Prince Dhrishtadyumna

112
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,610
when one invites people
to a ceremony

113
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,610
one must never draw
a weapon on them.

114
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,580
Calm down
Crown Prince.

115
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,480
Kings, Crown Princes

116
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,600
and 'Kshatriyas'

117
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,650
I request all of you

118
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,640
to bless this young man
and the Princess

119
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,580
and leave for your
respective kingdoms.

120
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,580
Now, you too should leave,
young 'Brahmin.'

121
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,670
The Crown Prince

122
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,670
will arrange for a chariot
and a palanquin for you two.

123
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,450
Indeed! Arrange for
a palanquin for me as well.

124
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,450
I am from the groom's side.

125
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,680
Pardon us, sire

126
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,570
but we will not
take the chariot.

127
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,550
We have taken an oath to walk.

128
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,670
Goodbye.

129
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,410
Stop...

130
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,410
I will complete the rituals
of your marriage.

131
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,470
And you have got that maiden
only because of me.

132
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,570
Do not forget that.

133
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,450
But before the marriage

134
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,450
I must seek the blessings
of my mother.

135
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,540
Then let's proceed.

136
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,610
I shall accompany you.

137
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,610
After all, I was the first
to stand up to protect you.

138
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,610
In other words,
I took the initiative.

139
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,610
Someshwar

140
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,380
carry me now.

141
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,450
Turn around, Someshwar.
Turn around.

142
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,570
Now, all the 'Brahmins'
may leave.

143
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
This right belongs solely to me.

144
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Bless you.

145
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,350
Allow me to leave, father.

146
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,320
You are allowed to leave,
daughter.

147
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,540
After seeking the blessings
of the 'Brahmin's' mother

148
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,380
you must return soon.

149
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,350
We shall conduct
your marriage here.

150
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,280
Bless you, friend.

151
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,520
The look of joy on your face

152
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,470
gives me great contentment.

153
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I would

154
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,380
like to gift you something.

155
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,370
These five stones.

156
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,420
The gems of
knowledge and patience

157
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,280
are to the right of the stone.

158
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,380
Those of love and dedication
are to the left.

159
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,300
And justice...

160
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,510
Justice is right in the center.

161
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,250
These are the fives bases
of righteousness, Draupadi.

162
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,410
What

163
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,470
do I do with them, Govind?

164
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,420
There are many instances
in one's life, Draupadi

165
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,310
when one is unable
to see the path.

166
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,350
In order to remind oneself
of righteousness

167
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,410
one requires an object.

168
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,370
The decision will always
be yours, Draupadi.

169
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,450
But taking a decision bearing
righteousness in mind

170
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,300
will be easier.
