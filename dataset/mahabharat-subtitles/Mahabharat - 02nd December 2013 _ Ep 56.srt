1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,040
There is just one punishment
for this mistake.

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,070
Banish him
from the Kuru kingdom!

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,270
But Arjun is my beloved
brother Pandu's son.

4
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,230
Hence, I won't be able
to punish him.

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,040
Minister!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,160
Now, you shall decide
on a punishment.

7
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,040
Why are you quiet, uncle?

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the King's order.

9
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,060
Decide on a punishment.

10
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,030
Prince Arjun has made
a mistake, Duryodhan.

11
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,110
But I am certain that

12
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,130
his intentions were not wrong.

13
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,140
No one can predict
one's intentions, Minister.

14
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,110
But judgment should be based

15
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,100
on what is evidently seen.

16
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,230
I believe
that if His Highness Karna

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,130
forgives Prince Arjun

18
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,060
then he needn't be punished.

19
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,170
Friend Karna shall
definitely forgive him.

20
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,970
But Arjun must

21
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,940
first wash his feet
and ask for forgiveness.

22
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,030
Minister

23
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,000
order Arjun to do so.

24
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,030
Prince Arjun

25
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,910
you must wash the feet
of His Highness Karna

26
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,100
and ask him for forgiveness.

27
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,840
Only if King of Anga,
Karna, agrees to it.

28
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,010
I agree to it.

29
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,190
Pardon me, King of Anga.

30
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,190
Let's proceed, Sanjay!

31
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,160
The occasion of the banquet
has been destroyed.

32
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,030
But, Your Majesty...

33
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,220
I won't be a part
of this banquet, Minister!

34
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,180
But yes...

35
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,000
This banquet was organized
to announce something.

36
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,060
Let me make that announcement.

37
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,030
Tomorrow

38
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,120
in the morning

39
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,950
at the court,
the Prince of Hastinapur

40
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,160
will be crowned by me!

41
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,900
I am certain that
tomorrow, Duryodhan

42
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,990
will be crowned as the Prince.

43
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,070
Brother Arjun was insulted
for the same reason.

44
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,840
When he couldn't defeat him
with his intellect

45
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,970
he took to insult

46
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,130
so that we are unable to reason
at the court tomorrow.

47
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,130
What will we
reason about, Nakul?

48
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,900
That you are the right person
to be crowned the Prince.

49
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,000
No.

50
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,070
Only Lord Indra gets to decide

51
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,070
as to how much rainfall
a place deserves.

52
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,910
Every mortal has to
abide by that decision.

53
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,810
A King too possesses
a similar right.

54
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,030
But if one is declared a ruler

55
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,830
then it certainly does not mean

56
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,800
that he can own
that kingdom forever.

57
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,870
Lord Indra is immortal.

58
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,770
He is not a common man.

59
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,970
No one gets to rule
a kingdom forever.

60
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,030
That is why, it is tradition

61
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,770
that whoever is bestowed
with the throne

62
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,030
gets to be the rightful King.

63
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,770
What if one conquers that
very kingdom with his might?

64
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,970
Isn't he the rightful King then?

65
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,840
We will attain our rights
with our might, brother!

66
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,810
We shall battle it out,
if the need be!

67
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,000
Brother, we cannot forget
how Arjun was insulted.

68
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,800
With whom will you fight, Bheem?

69
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,960
With your own family?

70
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,760
With grandfather Bhishma?

71
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,000
With uncle Dhritarashtra?

72
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,770
With uncle Vidur
or with your cousins?

73
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,960
No, Bheem.

74
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,860
You must not
even think of a war.

75
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,840
We have to abide

76
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,840
by what the King says.

77
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,810
Enough, Princess.

78
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,900
Thinking of unhappy things
only magnifies sadness.

79
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,810
Do not cry anymore.

80
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,840
Today, one of my sons
was insulted

81
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,800
by another son of mine.

82
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,800
When a brother insults
another brother

83
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,900
the bitterness remains
for life, Priyamvada.

84
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,800
But they don't know how they
are related in the first place.

85
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,760
Princess, they consider
themselves as enemies.

86
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,810
And enemies insult each other.

87
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,770
When the time comes,
even Prince Arjun will have

88
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,710
his revenge for being insulted
and will be contented.

89
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,710
What kind of a consolation
is this, Priyamvada?

90
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,640
How can I...

91
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,710
How can I
see them as enemies?

92
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,670
Arjun's heart must be
writhing in agony.

93
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
He might find a way
to fight with Karna.

94
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,670
Before that, I must pacify him.

95
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,760
Mother.

96
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,760
Arjun.

97
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,800
What are you doing, son?

98
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,770
The fire bath, mother.

99
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,770
Your tears of sadness
make me do the fire bath.

100
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
By doing so, I am repenting.

101
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,640
Mother, you are crying
because of me.

102
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,730
No, son.

103
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,570
You are not at fault.

104
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,770
It is my fault, mother.

105
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,730
You have taught me

106
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,540
that the other name
for strength is patience.

107
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,710
A person who loses his patience

108
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,500
also loses his strength.

109
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,760
That is why...

110
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,530
That is why, I lost my patience.

111
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,570
And this is my mistake, mother.

112
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,540
This is my mistake.

113
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,540
And this is the reason...

114
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,600
This is the reason why
you have tears in your eyes.

115
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,640
When a mother cries
because of her son

116
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,470
a strange agony pervades
her emotions and even her laugh

117
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,600
gets tainted by it, mother.

118
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,540
Look.

119
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,700
I am smiling now.

120
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,660
Now, quit feeling sad.
