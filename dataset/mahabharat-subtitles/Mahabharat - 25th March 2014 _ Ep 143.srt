1
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,060
Friend!

2
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,030
'The fishes shown in this scene'

3
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,070
'were generated
using computer graphics.'

4
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Is the son of a blind man
blind as well?

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Be quiet!

6
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Quit babbling!

7
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,910
Brother Duryodhan,
please calm down!

8
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,940
Go away,
Dusshasan.

9
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,940
Only this fire can extinguish
that burning in my heart.

10
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,030
Go away!

11
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,910
'Please order
brother-in-law Duryodhan'

12
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,930
'to lay down his weapons.'

13
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,040
'Take the weapons away from
Duryodhan and the King of Anga.'

14
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,000
'Is the son of a blind man
blind as well?'

15
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,900
'Is the son of a blind...
- Duryodhan and King of Anga.'

16
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
'Is the son of a blind...
- Please order brother-in-law...'

17
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,070
'Duryodhan and the King of Anga.
- To lay down their weapons.'

18
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Father, brother Duryodhan
has set his entire room on fire!

19
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,940
What!
Set his room on fire!

20
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,770
Why, Dusshasan?!
What caused him to do this?!

21
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,970
Upon seeing the court
of the Pandavas

22
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
brother had become
exceedingly agitated, father.

23
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,740
You must come with me
at once, father!

24
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,770
Let's go, father.

25
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,870
Friend, the reply
to an insult is revenge

26
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,930
and not killing oneself!

27
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,700
The Pandavas will have to
set themselves on fire, friend!

28
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,800
You need not
set yourself on fire.

29
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,670
You...

30
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
You need to calm down.

31
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,770
Please calm down.

32
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,930
Go away,
friend Karna!

33
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,730
Living on this earth now

34
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,670
cannot give me any peace!

35
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,700
My heart is burning
like the bed of the ocean!

36
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,740
Go away!

37
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,810
Duryodhan!

38
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,870
The fire of the ocean
does not burn itself up, son!

39
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,830
That fire is blanketed in water!

40
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,770
Have the strength
to be patient, Duryodhan.

41
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,770
How can I possibly
be patient, father?

42
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,730
The wood of this room
is not burning here!

43
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,670
My respect,
my pride

44
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,830
and the emotions of my heart
are burning here!

45
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,810
That daughter of Drupad

46
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,800
had snatched the weapons
from your son

47
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,810
in the court before everyone!

48
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,580
The insult a woman feels
when being disrobed

49
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,700
is nothing compared

50
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,460
to the insult

51
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,580
experienced by a warrior

52
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,460
when his weapons
are snatched from him!

53
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Karna...

54
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,360
My friend Maharathi Karna

55
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,520
had requested them

56
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,460
not to take away our weapons

57
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,360
but to sentence us
to death instead!

58
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,620
However, those Pandavas
paid no heed, father!

59
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,350
With the intent of insulting us

60
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,390
in some way or the other

61
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
they had conducted
the Rajsuya 'Yajna!'

62
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,530
And despite being disgraced

63
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,580
I was a part of that 'yajna.'

64
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,550
I was cursing my fate
during that ceremony.

65
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,450
Apart from killing myself

66
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,330
those Pandavas have left me

67
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,290
with no other alternative,
father!

68
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,450
No other alternative...

69
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,590
Son, killing oneself is not
the solution to any problem.

70
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,290
We will discuss
this matter calmly

71
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,450
but please,
let's go from here!

72
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,550
No, father!

73
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
No!
- Karna...

74
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,550
Karna, say something
to your friend!

75
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,390
Your Highness

76
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,320
I cannot bear to see
my friend in pain.

77
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,420
The solution to this problem

78
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,250
lies solely with you.

79
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,290
More than the sons of Pandu

80
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,250
you are chaser to him, Karna.

81
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,420
When it comes to your
dedication and competence

82
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
I have never questioned
their sincerity, dear.

83
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,490
Please guide us

84
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,390
to extinguish the fire
in Duryodhan's heart!

85
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,250
Blinded by the arrogance
in creating Indraprastha

86
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,450
the Pandavas have insulted
my friend, Your Highness!

87
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,290
Just give me the order.

88
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,390
I will defeat the Pandavas

89
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,260
and annex Indraprastha
to Hastinapur!

90
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,390
Go ahead and attack.

91
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,420
Dear Duryodhan,
I give the order

92
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,290
to go ahead and
attack Indraprastha

93
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,460
but please give up the thought
of setting yourself on fire.

94
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,350
Extinguish this fire.

95
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,320
Extinguish...
- No, father!

96
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,390
The question is no longer about
Indraprastha and Hastinapur!

97
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,320
It is not about two empires!

98
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,350
It is a personal matter now.

99
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,420
The excruciating pain
in my heart will subside

100
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,280
only when I will make
those five brothers

101
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,450
go through the same agony!

102
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,330
I do not wish to
merely defeat them, father.

103
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,390
I wish to insult them.

104
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,220
A tiny spark
on a pillow made of cotton

105
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,380
eventually

106
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,220
reduces it to ashes.

107
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,290
That fire cannot be extinguished

108
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,260
despite numerous efforts.

109
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,290
It burns every particle
of that cotton pillow!

110
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,320
This is the kind of insult

111
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,330
that should set
their bodies, hearts

112
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,160
and lives on fire,
father!

113
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,260
It should set them on fire!

114
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,250
Without laying
a finger on someone

115
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,180
the act of draining that being
completely of blood

116
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,190
can be achieved only by uncle,
brother Duryodhan.

117
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,280
But you insulted him.

118
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,250
That is why,
he returned to Gandhar.

119
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
Uncle

120
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,100
are you forsaking me?

121
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,200
When baby birds
are old enough to fly

122
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,170
their parents stop feeding them.

123
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
You are capable enough.

124
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,000
You can shove me
out of your way.

125
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,070
Now, to me

126
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,030
returning to Gandhar

127
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
is the only alternative.

128
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Move forth,
charioteer.

129
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,190
Uncle

130
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,100
I had shoved you with this arm

131
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,000
and now,
I shall cut it off!

132
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,170
But you cannot leave today.

133
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,130
Please pardon me,
uncle

134
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,000
and let us proceed
towards Hastinapur

135
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,990
otherwise...
- Let it be, dear.

136
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,160
Let it be.

137
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,970
You have learnt the art
of shedding crocodile tears

138
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,160
from me after all

139
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,160
and it will have

140
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,000
no effect on me.

141
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,100
Uncle

142
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,030
then go ahead and punish me.

143
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,190
Any mode of atonement you say

144
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,900
shall be honoured by me.

145
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,990
If you tell me

146
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,960
to serve the Pandavas for a year

147
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,190
I will certainly do it

148
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,130
but uncle

149
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,130
you cannot leave.

150
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,930
I need you.

151
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,040
Not just for a year

152
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,030
but even if I ask you
to serve them your entire life

153
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,930
the punishment
will be inadequate

154
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
for you

155
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,130
and that would

156
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,970
not be a punishment
for insulting me.

157
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,160
It would only be one
for your foolishness.

158
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,130
Uncle

159
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,870
when the wheel of a chariot
attempts to outrun it

160
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,900
it is bound to fall.

161
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,960
The chariot may get
another wheel

162
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,090
but the wheel does not
get another chariot.

163
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,870
This is the kind of foolishness
I have exhibited, uncle.

164
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,900
Uncle

165
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,930
I join my hands before you

166
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
and take the oath

167
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,840
that henceforth,
if I disobey you

168
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,870
it will be an invitation
to my death.

169
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Uncle

170
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,130
I join my hands before you

171
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,100
and take the oath

172
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,970
that henceforth,
if I ever disobey you

173
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,030
it will be an invitation
to my death.

174
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,840
I hope, unlike your
foolish friend Karna

175
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,030
you will not speak of
engaging in a war.

176
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,970
I have always felt
that wars are worthless.

177
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,870
You know quite well

178
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,040
that a plan should be such

179
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,810
where we must not
end up getting hurt

180
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,970
but the enemy

181
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,870
should end up losing everything.

182
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,900
Uncle!

183
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,810
Uncle

184
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
I am not asking for
a war this time.

185
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,910
I wish to insult them.

186
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,960
Insult!

187
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,010
If you snatch everything
from a person

188
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,770
but not his pride

189
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,810
then it will not benefit you.

190
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,840
Every year,
the winter season

191
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,970
snatches the leaves
from the trees

192
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,870
but foolish is the season

193
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,900
which does not
chop the roots off.

194
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,740
That is why,
every year

195
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,880
new leaves grow on the trees.

196
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,760
The way

197
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,780
the roots of a tree

198
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,800
give nourishment to it

199
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,860
similarly

200
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,830
the pride of people

201
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
strengthens them.

202
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,740
If you wish
to insult the Pandavas

203
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,740
then do you have the desire of
breaking their pride, darling?

204
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,800
Then take all that anger out

205
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,830
not on the Pandavas
but on their wife

206
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,740
Panchali

207
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,880
by channelling it towards her.

208
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,640
Panchali

209
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,830
is the pride of the Pandavas.

210
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,800
She signifies their dignity.

211
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,910
When Panchali's respect shatters

212
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,900
the life of the Pandavas

213
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,770
will be in ruins!

214
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,780
Uncle, that laugh of Panchali

215
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,640
is still resonating in my ears!

216
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,800
I wish to obliterate
that joy from her face!

217
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,770
Forever...
