1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,380
Tell the Princess of Yadava,
Subhadra

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,440
that Prince Arjun
wishes to meet her.

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,330
As you say, Prince.

4
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,470
Greetings, Princess of Yadava.

5
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,340
Prince Arjun is here.

6
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,440
Prince Arjun!

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,400
Handmaidens, take these away.
And you, prepare the seat.

8
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,240
Tell him to enter!

9
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,240
Wait!

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Tell him to enter after a while.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
As you say, Princess.

12
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,410
Greetings, son of Pandu!
- Greetings.

13
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,310
Welcome!

14
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,170
Wait...

15
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,140
Walk carefully. I have placed
those clothes there to be dried

16
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,330
because I am to leave
for Dwaraka.

17
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,210
Walk carefully.

18
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,310
Careful!

19
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,370
Now, move forth.

20
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,200
You too are a very
graceful dancer, son of Pandu.

21
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,110
Are you contented now
by making me dance?

22
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,300
I am quite contented!

23
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,270
Did your brother Krishna teach
you to exact revenge like so?

24
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,180
My brother never takes revenge.

25
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,310
When your uncle Kansa
had abducted your parents

26
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,240
then in order to
exact revenge from him

27
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,040
your brother Krishna
had slain him.

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,040
And you say that your brother
Krishna does not exact revenge?

29
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,140
He did not exact revenge.

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,180
My brother Krishna says

31
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,110
that justice makes
the world go round.

32
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,270
If the culprit isn't punished

33
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,080
then the world will lose
its state of balance.

34
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,300
I don't get it.

35
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,070
Neither do I.

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,010
I never understand
any of the things he does.

37
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,180
Peculiar are the things
Krishna does.

38
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,210
He compels one
to meditate over things.

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,270
I have come to you
to learn more about him.

40
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,130
So, you've come to me
to learn about him?

41
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,050
Tell me something.
By submitting to Jarasandha

42
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,140
why did your brother Krishna
leave from Mathura?

43
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,040
And when Jarasandha
attacked Dwaraka

44
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,170
your brother defeated him.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,100
He could have done so
in Mathura, couldn't he?

46
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,200
I don't know.

47
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,100
Son of Pandu

48
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,240
I hope you will invite me
to your wedding.

49
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,070
First, brother Yudhishthir and
brother Bheem will get married.

50
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,140
My marriage is
out of the question.

51
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,050
Tell me something...
- I don't know.

52
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,110
You can learn about my brother
by talking to him yourself

53
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,940
when you meet him.

54
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,940
You should leave.

55
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,110
I have to get ready
for the journey.

56
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,980
Handmaiden, pick up the clothes.

57
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,910
But first, answer my question.

58
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,100
I don't know.

59
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,910
You should leave.

60
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,970
Subhadra.

61
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,070
Subhadra.

62
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,140
Greetings, mother.
- Greetings.

63
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,910
Subhadra, I just got the news

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,910
that the path leading
to Dwaraka from here

65
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,100
has been obstructed by
Demon Kalyavan and his army.

66
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,980
Travelling by that path

67
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,000
is not safe.

68
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,010
Subhadra.

69
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,080
Dear, why are you so scared?

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,040
I will send Arjun with you
to protect you.

71
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Now, stop crying-

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,980
Arjun

73
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,840
take Subhadra to Dwaraka

74
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,810
safely.

75
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,840
But mother

76
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,840
is it right to leave
Hastinapur now?

77
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,010
Certainly.

78
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,070
There is no question of
a struggle now, Arjun.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,880
Duryodhan has
accepted Yudhishthir

80
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,880
as the Crowned Prince
whole-heartedly.

81
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,010
Righteousness dwells
in his heart.

82
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,810
You can be worry-free and
take Subhadra to Dwaraka.

83
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,810
Get ready to leave
tomorrow at dawn.

84
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,940
Certainly, mother.

85
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,900
'Hastinapur.'

86
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,970
'A Few Days Later.'

87
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,770
We need to let our horses
rest here for a while.

88
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,900
You should freshen up
and have your meal.

89
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,840
Are you certain
Kalyavan is not here?

90
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,850
Are you still scared
despite me being with you?

91
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,910
No...

92
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,800
My brother says that
Kalyavan is very powerful

93
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,910
and that no weapon can kill him.

94
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,870
He is ghostly white

95
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,710
and has yellow hair!

96
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,780
He seems exceedingly scary.

97
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,970
Your brother Krishna comes up
with the most fascinating tales!

98
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,910
I shall not tolerate
my brother's insult!

99
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,870
Hey, where are you going?

100
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,710
I do not require your help.

101
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,880
I can reach Dwaraka
with my handmaidens.

102
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,680
Let's go.
I do not wish to rest here.

103
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,880
You won't reach
Dwaraka this way.

104
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,900
You will have to come back!

105
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,710
And what if you
come across Kalyavan?

106
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,740
Arjun!

107
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,780
What happened?
Did you come across Kalyavan?

108
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,640
Arjun!

109
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Subhadra!

110
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,470
Subhadra!

111
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,210
Subhadra!

112
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,310
Arjun!

113
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Are you Krishna?
- I am your doom, Kalyavan.

114
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
If you are not Krishna

115
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,310
then you are of no use to me

116
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,210
because Jarasandha had said

117
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,240
that if I abduct
Krishna's sister

118
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,370
then Krishna will certainly
come to protect his sister.

119
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,370
And if you are Krishna

120
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,280
then protect her.

121
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,340
Protect her!

122
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,110
Are you alright?

123
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,010
Arjun!

124
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Brother!

125
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,520
Brother Krishna save me!

126
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,430
Save me from this demon!

127
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,490
Brother Krishna!
- Brother Krishna!

128
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,290
Brother Krishna!

129
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,490
Come here

130
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,520
and save
your sister from this demon!

131
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,320
What do you think?

132
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,530
That your brother
can come here and save you?

133
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,430
Hey, Vasudeva!
You shepherd!

134
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,390
By slaying the demon Shankhasura

135
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
you seem to be flying too high!

136
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,490
You think you are
a better warrior than me

137
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,390
and Jarasandha,
the King of Magadha!

138
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,290
Then come here
and save your sister!

139
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Come here!

140
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,130
Show yourself, coward!

141
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,130
Show yourself now!
