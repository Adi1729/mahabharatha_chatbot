1
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,450
People of Kuru

2
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,290
this day has ushered a new
beginning to the Kuru kingdom.

3
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,390
Happier times

4
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,490
and new successes
shall begin today, people.

5
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,250
Before man sets out on a journey

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,480
he stands at the gate

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,230
takes a look at his house

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,490
and embraces each memory
that resides within it.

9
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,320
Today, I too

10
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,290
am reminiscing old memories.

11
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,420
I can recall the time
when, in the royal courtyard

12
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,420
my beloved Dhritarashtra,
Pandu and Vidur

13
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,390
would sit next to me
and study their lessons.

14
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,250
Once, on an early morning,
I saw the three Princes

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,420
playing a strange game,

16
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,280
In that game, Pandu and Vidur

17
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,330
had climbed to the
highest branches of a tree

18
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,280
and were calling out
to their eldest brother

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,190
while jumping off that tree
with great confidence.

20
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,190
And Dhritarashtra ran to them
and caught them in his arms

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
and did not let them
fall to the ground.

22
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,320
Upon seeing this, I told
the three Princes to stop.

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,120
Then I called Pandu
over to me and asked him

24
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,180
as to

25
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,320
what kind of a game
were the three playing.

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,290
I said, they could have died
had they fallen to the ground.

27
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,120
On hearing this,
Pandu smiled and said

28
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,180
that

29
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,350
his elder brother
was standing there

30
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,350
and would never
have let him fall.

31
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,350
Upon hearing this, I told Pandu

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,190
that Dhritarashtra
could only hear his voice

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,260
but could not see him.

34
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,160
Upon hearing this, Pandu said

35
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,250
that

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,280
his elder brother

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,090
did not require eyesight
to see him.

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,080
He said, his brother's love for
him was enough to help him see.

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,180
That day, those three boys

40
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,160
my disciples taught me

41
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,250
a new lesson.

42
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,030
The lesson of love and trust.

43
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,990
Your Majesty

44
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,220
when Lord Yama* must have come to take your younger brother away
The god of death.

45
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,060
he would never
have questioned Him

46
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,050
as to

47
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,160
whom he needed to entrust
his sons with while going away.

48
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,130
I can say with complete
confidence, Your Majesty

49
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,020
that he must never have

50
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,120
put forth this question.

51
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,090
Be it jumping off
branches of a tree

52
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,990
or meeting Lord Yama himself

53
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,150
your younger brother had nothing

54
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,190
but faith in you, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,990
Only in you.

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,960
I will not be able to say
anything more, Your Majesty.

57
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,990
At this point of time

58
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,890
may the Lord motivate you!

59
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,050
This is my blessing.

60
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,890
This is what
I was talking about.

61
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,950
Your Majesty

62
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,920
everyone is eagerly waiting

63
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,020
to hear your announcement.

64
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,760
'All my life, I have known
only one warrior'

65
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,790
'who has never accepted defeat.'

66
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,950
'And I have always tried
to become proficient like him.'

67
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,860
'And this is the reason
of my victory.'

68
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,760
'And that warrior
is my biggest motivation.'

69
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,920
'My elder brother
Dhritarashtra.'

70
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,850
People of Kuru

71
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,020
I am faced
with a terrible dilemma.

72
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I have always had the intention

73
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,750
of choosing the most able Prince
during the coronation ceremony.

74
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,950
That is why
this competition was held.

75
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,890
But unfortunately

76
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,950
the outcome of this competition

77
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,760
was such

78
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,760
that one could draw
different conclusions from it.

79
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,920
The decision is a tough one

80
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,780
because uncle's advice

81
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,790
is appropriate.

82
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,960
A King takes the oath
of being righteous.

83
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,950
When it comes to me, this oath

84
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,720
cannot be forgotten either.

85
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,690
That is why

86
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,760
I must look for righteousness
within my heart

87
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,830
for it is very important.

88
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,110
A King takes the oath
of being righteous.

89
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,050
When it comes to me, this oath

90
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,010
cannot be forgotten either.

91
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,040
That is why

92
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,120
I must look for righteousness
within my heart

93
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,180
for it is very important.

94
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,140
Your Majesty

95
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,210
everyone here
awaits your decision.

96
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,950
You have a righteous heart

97
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,170
and no one doubts this.

98
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,950
You must

99
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,920
ask your heart before taking
the decision, Your Majesty.

100
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,980
I, King Dhritarashtra

101
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,980
announce that

102
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,880
the crowned Prince of Hastinapur

103
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,140
is... - May the Lord
bless the King of Kuru!

104
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,910
Your Majesty

105
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,970
I apologize
for interrupting you!

106
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
I know that today

107
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,880
you are going to announce
the heir to the throne

108
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,020
and that is why, I have
come to request to you

109
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,950
that out of my disciples

110
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,970
no one ought to be
chosen in the court.

111
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,010
What do you mean?
- Until a sculptor is satisfied

112
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,020
even the Almighty cannot reside
in the idol made by him.

113
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,810
And that idol cannot be deemed
worthy of worship.

114
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,880
I do not understand you.

115
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,040
Your Majesty

116
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,850
Dronacharya has not yet
been paid by the Princes.

117
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,010
That is why, until the Princes
are his disciples

118
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,080
we cannot coronate
any of the Princes.

119
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,850
So, what does the mighty
Dronacharya expect?

120
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,010
I expect my disciples,
Your Majesty

121
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,780
to pay me in the form of
the art I have taught them.

122
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,010
Let me see, who is the most
superior amongst my disciples.

123
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,910
I wish to see, who is
the most capable disciple.

124
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,780
Indeed, sire.

125
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,940
A teacher testing his disciple

126
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,770
is the most apt way
of judging him.

127
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,940
Then no one shall charge us
for being partial.

128
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,950
Pardon me, Your Majesty!
Pardon me.

129
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,710
What is the need of testing
the capabilities time and again?

130
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,820
If one looks at
one's reflection for too long

131
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,750
one sees ugliness in it,
Dronacharya.

132
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,010
Capability is a virtue
of the soul

133
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,950
and not an adornment
of the face, King of Gandhar.

134
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,920
And it does not show
in a reflection.

135
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,980
But was the competition
not held, Minister?

136
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,940
But there was no definitive
outcome of that competition.

137
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,810
Even His Highness
has agreed to this.

138
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,780
That is why, if the capabilities
are now judged

139
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,980
through the medium
of paying Dronacharya

140
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,880
then what problem
do you have with it?

141
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,970
Certainly.

142
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,840
Since the competition
was inconclusive

143
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,850
resorting to this method
seems appropriate.

144
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,980
So, Dronacharya.
Ask for your fee.

145
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,820
The Prince who will be able
to convince you with his might

146
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,940
shall be the most capable one.

147
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,880
But while seeking your fee

148
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,750
what if you become partial

149
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,680
and choose only
one particular Prince as

150
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,910
the most capable one?

151
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,910
Your doubt is an insult to me,
King of Gandhar.

152
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,850
A teacher can never be partial.

153
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,810
And whether my fee

154
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,670
can be paid by one Prince

155
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,910
or all the Princes
for that matter

156
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,680
is a matter of doubt.

157
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,810
What are you asking for,
Dronacharya?

158
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,650
I want revenge
for being insulted.

159
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,870
The King of Panchal, Drupad

160
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,880
needs to be at my feet.

161
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,910
The King of Panchal, Drupad

162
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,950
needs to be at my feet.

163
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,780
I was insulted gravely
in the court of Panchal once

164
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,950
at the hands
of my friend Drupad.

165
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,790
The hurtful words of an enemy
denote a challenge

166
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,960
but those of a friend

167
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,020
denote an insult.

168
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,720
When a friend insults you

169
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
your whole life gets poisoned.

170
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,850
My disciples

171
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,910
I have endured the fire
of this insult within me

172
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,860
and lived for years.

173
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,820
Had I made up my mind,
I could have defeated Drupad

174
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,820
at that very moment

175
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,950
but he

176
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,750
had insulted my art.

177
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,720
That is why, I took an oath

178
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,690
that one day

179
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,750
I will defeat him
at the hands of my disciples!

180
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,650
And today

181
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
that moment has come, Princes.

182
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,820
That moment has come, Princes

183
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,820
when you have the opportunity

184
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,720
of fulfilling the vow
of your teacher.

185
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,750
Who will be able
to pay me my fees?

186
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,850
Do you have the capability?

187
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,850
Do you have the capability?

188
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,690
No!
Impossible!

189
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,780
A powerful and experienced
warrior like Drupad

190
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,760
cannot be faced by my sons.

191
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Panchal has more than
two crore soldiers.

192
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,780
And the fort of
the capital city Kampilya

193
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,620
is immense and impenetrable!

194
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,850
No, mighty Drona.

195
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,690
Ask for something else.

196
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,690
This is my fee for teaching,
Your Majesty.

197
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,780
This is not business.

198
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,810
I want either revenge

199
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,720
or nothing else.

200
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,650
If I could not fortify the might

201
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,850
and self-confidence
of my disciples

202
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,620
then it is my misfortune,
Your Majesty.

203
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,590
But you need not feel sad.

204
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,690
I will go to another kingdom
to look for brave men.

205
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,560
I will fortify them with my art
so that they avenge my insult

206
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,650
because, Your Majesty

207
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,790
I shall have my revenge.

208
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,780
Then you must find
the heir to your throne

209
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,560
from another kingdom.

210
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,780
Allow me to leave.

211
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,680
Teacher!
