1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,430
Arjun!

2
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,160
Stop, Duryodhan.

3
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,260
Dusk sets is not because of a person.

4
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,210
But because of time.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,310
Hence, don't get angry, dear.

6
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,280
Because tomorrow morning.

7
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,380
You will need both anger and courage.

8
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,310
Grandsire...

9
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,350
Soldiers!

10
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,160
Grandsire's head needs support.

11
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,420
Go and get some pillows.

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,360
No, dear.

13
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,430
I don't need any kind of comfort.

14
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,210
It isn't nice to wish
for any kind of comfort,

15
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,310
during one's last journey.

16
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,320
The less the burden of comforts are,

17
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,260
the easier the journey gets.

18
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,400
Dear,

19
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,430
don't give my head any comfort.

20
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,440
Just keep it in an upright position.

21
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,380
Arjun!

22
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,210
If a warrior gets...

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,280
the support of arrows,

24
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,280
after his death he goes to heaven.

25
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,370
Grandsire

26
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,280
I have hurt you a lot.

27
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,270
I have hurt you a lot.
I even insulted you, Grandsire.

28
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,450
But the respect my heart holds
for you has never reduced.

29
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,420
I have always seen you as the
leader of Hastinapur, Grandsire.

30
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:44,200
The leader who stopped you from
reaching the limit of skies.

31
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,270
Today...

32
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,180
Now, the leader is going
to go away from all of you.

33
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,260
I hold no anger against you.

34
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,200
If you seek forgiveness from me today

35
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,230
I will definitely forgive you, dear.

36
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:20,280
F- Forgive... Forgive me, Grandsire.
Forgive me, Grandsire.

37
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,290
And bless me, so that I
attain victory, Grandsire.

38
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,420
- Bless me.
- No, dear.

39
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,290
I cannot grant your wish.

40
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:49,310
Because I have already blessed
Yudhisthir to be victorious.

41
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,390
I cannot do politics anymore.

42
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,410
But...

43
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,200
Even you have right
on my blessings, dear.

44
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,170
I...

45
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,300
bless you,

46
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,300
that while breathing your last,

47
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,250
your face will have a
smile of contentment.

48
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,280
If...

49
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,160
you achieve contentment
out of righteous deeds,

50
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,230
you will go to heaven.

51
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,260
But if you achieve contentment
out of unrighteous deeds,

52
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,210
you will go to the nether world.

53
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,210
Now, the decision is up to you, dear.

54
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:41,220
Grandsire, even while dying you
couldn't give up on your inclinations.

55
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,390
I had thought that in your last moments,

56
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,390
you would show some generosity.

57
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,360
But no...

58
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,210
you have always been against me, Grandsire.

59
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,150
Look, Grandsire...

60
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,220
The sun is moving towards the south now.

61
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
It is believed

62
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,360
that the sun moving towards the north,

63
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,390
leads one to heaven.

64
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,370
And the sun that heads towards the south,

65
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,310
takes one to the nether world.

66
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,410
This is your punishment, Grandsire.

67
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,220
It is the punishment for your partiality.

68
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,200
You will have to suffer in
the nether world, Grandsire.

69
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,340
You have to suffer.

70
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,390
Duryodhan,

71
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,230
what kind of a misdeed
you have committed?

72
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,410
How could you curse Grandsire?

73
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,320
All these are pointless, Bheem.

74
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,230
One paves the way to heaven
or hell by one's actions.

75
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,430
The movement of sun has
nothing to do with it.

76
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,340
Grandsire Bhisma had found

77
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,270
himself a place in heaven.

78
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,300
The minute he sacrificed traditions

79
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,250
and recognised the true
form of righteousness.

80
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,190
Hence

81
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,220
you don't need to worry, Bheem.

82
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,290
You are blessed with the
boon of self willed death.

83
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,230
Free yourself from this pain.

84
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,400
No, dear.

85
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,440
Pain

86
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,420
sacred the soul.

87
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,230
Pain cleanses the soul, dear.

88
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,390
All of you

89
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,470
should stop worrying about my pain.

90
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,340
I have

91
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,210
decided

92
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,340
that I

93
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,190
will lie down on this bed of arrows

94
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,360
and await my death every moment.

95
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,200
My lifelong deeds

96
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,300
will continue to hurt me

97
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,440
in the form of arrows, Vasudev.

98
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,390
The way

99
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,290
even elderly person is followed
by deeds of his lifetime.

100
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,400
When Yudhistir receives knowledge,

101
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,200
Bheem receives justice,

102
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:34,170
Arjun receives prestige, and Nakul and Sahadev receives happiness and contentment.

103
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:41,190
Only then will I be able
to let go of this body.

104
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,740
When the throne of Hastinapur

105
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,580
sees justice and courage together.

106
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,720
Only then will the
subjects of the Kuru dynasty

107
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,690
experience heaven on earth.

108
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,550
Only then

109
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,700
will I accept my departure to heaven.

110
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,640
Now

111
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,520
I wish to be left alone, Pandavas.

112
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,600
I want to bear this pain

113
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,760
all alone.

114
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,440
All of you should now depart.

115
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,710
That's an order.

116
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,720
Your highness,

117
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,600
Hastinapur's flag has been destroyed.

118
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,620
And the pillar that held it
high, too has been brought down.

119
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,510
Hastinapur's flag...

120
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,720
has been destroyed.

121
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,660
I know everything, Vidura.

122
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,560
I know everything.

123
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:49,740
I know that the Pandavas have brutally
attacked Hastinapur's dignity and prestige.

124
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,450
All the five had together attacked, Vidura.

125
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,720
Grandsire's pious body,

126
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,690
was tarnished with arrows by them, Vidura.

127
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,530
With arrows!

128
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,470
Pandavas, Your Highness?

129
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,510
Your sons were the one who 
made the attack.

130
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,540
An old man, who has the rights on all the comforts in the world. He was handed weapons...

131
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,490
And taken to the battlefield,

132
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,690
by your sons.

133
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,110
The one who should be
respected and honored...

134
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,920
The eldest member of such a family...

135
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,920
has been injured with various
humiliations and poisonous...

136
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,990
allegations by your son.

137
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,130
Whose death-bed...

138
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,070
deserves to be as soft
as a mother's heart.

139
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,980
That old man.

140
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,050
is lying on a death-bed 
made of arrows

141
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,020
because of your sons.

142
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,950
Even when the birds 
leave their nest,

143
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,920
they don't destroy it.

144
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,050
But your sons...

145
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,960
Your sons set the roof under
which this family lives on fire.

146
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,990
- Prime Minister! 
- Not Prime Minister, Your Highness!

147
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,140
I have renounced that position,

148
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,110
the day this battle began.

149
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,980
If you want to punish me, 
then lift the sword,

150
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,080
and kill me, beheaded me.

151
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,020
But I will not be able 
to stay quiet today.

152
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,090
Instead of letting such 
children live,

153
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,930
why didn't you kill them
at the time of their birth?

154
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,030
Vidura!

155
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,010
Are you watching?

156
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,950
Look, my hands lost 
their strength.

157
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,020
My feet...

158
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,990
My feet cannot take the burden 
of my body!

159
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,190
In such circumstances,

160
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,000
don't wound my heart, my dear.

161
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,070
Don't leave me in times like this.

162
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,910
It's your sons that have
wounded many hearts, sire.

163
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,110
The place of the coal is in the stove.

164
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,060
You cannot place it on the throne.

165
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,950
Your son is the coal of 
this lineage, sire.

166
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,090
And you,

167
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,140
tried to give that son 
the throne!

168
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,910
That is Kuru dynasty's and 
your misfortune, sire.

169
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,140
I have renounced you, sire.

170
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,050
I will not see you even at the 
time of your death.

171
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,930
Even your shadows seems 
like fire to me.

172
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,160
Yes.

173
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,990
Till King Yudhistira's arrival,

174
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,160
I will continue to protect
the throne and the nation,

175
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,170
to the best of my ability.

176
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,040
And keep in mind, sire.

177
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,010
This battle will not continue
for as long as it has been,

178
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,020
going on.

179
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,890
All your 100 sons will be killed.

180
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,130
And soon the Pandavas,

181
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,100
will be victorious and succesfull.

182
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
And you...

183
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,040
You will sit here,

184
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,090
and mourn, sire.

185
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,000
My concsience will cursed you!

186
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,890
Cursed!
