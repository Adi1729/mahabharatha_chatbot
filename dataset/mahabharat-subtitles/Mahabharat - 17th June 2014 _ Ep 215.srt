1
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,800
Uttar!

2
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,500
'Except your five husbands, the whole dynasty 
will be wiped out in this war.'

3
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,500
'Master, today in the battlefield, I will raise 
the flag of victory.'

4
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,020
Uttar!

5
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
Uttara

6
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,500
your brother is the first martyr.

7
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,200
A new foundation of the nation 
is being build,

8
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,400
and the first flag raised on it,

9
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,700
will be Uttar's, son of 
King of Virat.

10
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Until the end of time,

11
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,800
Pandu's dynasty will be indebted 
to Uttar, Uttara.

12
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,500
Prince Uttar's sacrifice

13
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,500
will not go in vain, 
King of Virat.

14
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,800
Our enemies will definitely have 
our vengeance for this.

15
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,500
Water...

16
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Yudhistira should've been 
died today, Grandsire.

17
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,500
If only King of Virat's son didn't 
display courage!
- Don't worry, my dear.

18
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,400
Tomorrow, his excellency Bhisma would certainly 
captured Yudhistira with his own hands.

19
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Today we've shown destruction to 
our enemies' soldiers.

20
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:34,500
Tomorrow in the battlefield, no soldiers 
will protect him.

21
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
They all will be in fear,

22
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,500
after seeing our might!

23
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Fear?

24
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,250
Foolish Duryodhana!
A widow's wailing will not make even 
her youngest child frightful.

25
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,400
So why do they have to fear?

26
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Moreover what courage had you displayed, except for 
killing a 15 years old youth?

27
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Even it was not with your own hands, 
but by forcing me to do it!

28
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
King of Madra,

29
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,500
from common soldier to the general,

30
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,500
the value of one's courage is 
devoted to the king.

31
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,300
Both victory or defeat, the value is still 
devoted to the king.

32
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:40,500
When the opening dish is served, there's no difference between 'laddoo' and 'kheer' because both of them are sweet, King of Madra.

33
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,500
We have victory today,

34
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,800
and in this battle, the other name of 
winning is courage.

35
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Uncle's right.

36
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,800
Today's victory

37
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,800
will add strength to face 
tomorrow's battle.

38
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I want to know,

39
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,500
winning can lift spirit in war.

40
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,500
Until you experience defeat,

41
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,900
how can be any lift in potency?

42
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Prince Uttar not just saved 
Brother Yudhistira's life.

43
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,500
But saved us from defeat as well. 
He has become a guardian.

44
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,900
From now on, he won't let defeat 
to fall on us.

45
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,500
Righteousness is destined to achieve victory!

46
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,900
Crown Prince Duryodhana,

47
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,900
don't forget,

48
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,800
that in a war without the King's presence,

49
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,000
all responsibilites are imposed 
on the crown prince.

50
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,900
And in this war,

51
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,500
the king's not present, but you are.

52
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,500
That's why, think like a king.

53
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
And,

54
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,500
other than thinking about victory, 
think about your ability.

55
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,500
What if

56
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
today's win

57
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,200
becomes loss tomorrow?

58
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,500
Sons of Pandu will certainly 
make a plan

59
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,500
which effect's will demolish 
everyone's morals here.

60
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,300
Today, grandsire had broken 
our battle formation.

61
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
But tomorrow, it won't happen again.

62
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,900
Tomorrow, before the sun sets, 
we will capture Duryodhana.

63
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,900
The first day of war,

64
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,500
from 7 'akshauhini' army,

65
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,900
one had been destroyed 
by King Yudhistira.

66
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
And Vasudev

67
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,800
there's one question in our soldiers' mind.

68
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,800
If this is a righteous war, then why did we 
experience defeat today?

69
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,900
A righteous was is also a war, 
General Dhristadyumna.

70
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,900
In war, one can't escape neither 
from winning nor losing.

71
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,900
General Dhristadyumna,

72
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,900
a soldier's duty is to strife 
with his weapon.

73
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,900
Winning or losing is in the Almighty's hand.

74
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:41,900
But Prince Arjuna after Prince Uttar's death, 
fear has gripped each soldier's heart.

75
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,900
How can our soldiers retaliate Grandsire Bhisma 
and Master Drona attacks?

76
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,500
It is right.

77
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,500
As long as his excellency Bhisma 
has a role in this war,

78
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,900
victory is impossible for us.

79
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,500
Defeating Master Drona becomes 
impossible as well.

80
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,800
If grandsire still takes part in this war,

81
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,800
he will destroy all our armies.

82
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,900
Tomorrow, I will challenge grandsire, 
one on one.
