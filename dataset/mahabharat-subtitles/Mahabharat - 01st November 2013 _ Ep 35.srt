1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,430
The dinner today is
based on a simple rule.

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,340
None of you shall bend
your elbows while you eat.

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,370
Let's begin.

4
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,300
Why do we need to
fold arms, Duryodhan?

5
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,310
We could feed each other.

6
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,490
Well done!

7
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,240
That's the apt way
to eat, Yudhishtir.

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,310
All of you may follow
what Yudhishtir just did.

9
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,400
Your Excellency...

10
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,460
His Highness
has summoned you.

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,340
Princes...

12
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,340
This is not the just
the apt way to eat

13
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,340
but a way of life.

14
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,310
As long as siblings

15
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,210
care for each other

16
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,370
it helps the family
stay together

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,430
and makes
the kingdom prosper.

18
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,200
All of you must
have meaIs this way.

19
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,270
Duryodhan, it's time
for you to feed us.

20
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,400
I want 'laddoo'.

21
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,160
We must follow the directive.

22
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,140
When one reciprocates

23
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
rudely to a kind
gesture of yours

24
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,130
or if someone's gets rewarded
for one's crudeness.

25
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,070
Then one's forced to think that

26
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,260
what does doing good

27
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,270
and being ethical yield?

28
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,200
But one must think what
a crude human being attains.

29
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,000
One who possesses a rude
demeanour is seldom at peace

30
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,000
and never experiences
stability.

31
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,060
Such a human being would
always stay anxious.

32
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,010
Faith makes him
chase after itself forever.

33
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,170
Is that happiness?

34
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,100
But the one who's ethical
the one who's kind

35
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,040
and the one who possesses
a kind demeanour

36
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,200
experiences peace.

37
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,060
Nothing proves as an
obstacle to such a human being.

38
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,130
Such a man always
receives respect

39
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,130
and experiences tranquility.

40
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,970
That proves that a kind gesture

41
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,970
isn't a way to attain
happiness in future.

42
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,100
In fact one who's kind,
is happiness personified.

43
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,270
A bad gesture too
may not yield sorrow.

44
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,110
Iniquity, at that very moment,
springs forth sorrow.

45
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,970
Righteousness doesn't
become happiness

46
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,970
but is happiness
in itself.

47
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,140
Hail Lord Shiva!

48
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,070
For Pandu's soul to
rest in peace

49
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,130
I've arranged to venerate
Lord Kaleshwar.

50
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,170
That's good.

51
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,060
I was about to
suggest you the same.

52
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,030
But why would the
soul of a pious man like Pandu

53
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,140
be not at peace, grandsire?

54
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,100
Religious texts state that until
the son does the final rites

55
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,130
the departed's soul remains
in the netherworld.

56
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,900
I mean to say

57
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,060
the son has to get married

58
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,070
and experience fatherhood.

59
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,130
And that helps his dead
father's soul attain salvation.

60
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,100
You mean, the happiness
of progeny is paramount

61
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,970
to a father, grandsire.

62
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,070
But the subjects of
a kingdom are

63
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,130
like a King's children too.

64
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,900
Their happiness is of
utmost importance to him.

65
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,970
Vidur, don't be diplomatic.

66
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,940
Whenever I talk about my son

67
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,940
you alter your
religious teachings.

68
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,100
That isn't true.
- If that isn't true

69
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,970
then whenever I talk about
my son's coronation

70
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,070
why do you speak against it?
- I am not against Duryodhan.

71
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,070
But it's not yet time
for his coronation.

72
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,030
Bhil women who belong to the
Malanchal mountains in the South

73
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,970
used sandalwood as fuel.

74
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,830
You must be aware of that.

75
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,800
If one's rewarded things
one doesn't deserve

76
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,960
he may not value it.

77
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,000
That may make him irresponsible
towards his duties too.

78
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,000
Mathura's King Kansa has
been killed

79
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,000
by his nephew.

80
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,810
I hope you know of it.

81
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,940
If a King isn't loved
and respected by his subjects

82
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,870
he can't remain a King for long.

83
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,030
Do you want Duryodhan
to be proved

84
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,940
an incompetent ruler?

85
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,800
Then you must put his
abilities to test, grandsire.

86
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,810
Before that, I need
to appoint a teacher

87
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
for the princes.

88
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,840
I want all of them to

89
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,770
to attend the seminary.

90
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,960
They've to become
capable enough.

91
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,800
Their abilities can't be tested

92
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,740
before they undergo
rigorous training.

93
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,800
Vidhur, arrange for
the same at the earliest.

94
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
But once they undergo training

95
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,840
Duryodhan needs to
be crowned a King.

96
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,830
He needs to be crowned.

97
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,800
After they undergo training

98
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,870
the prince who's eligible

99
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,740
shall be crowned the King.

100
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,830
That's a promise, dear.

101
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,870
But you'll have to judge
all of them as a King.

102
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Not as a father.

103
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,730
Nakul,
Sahadev...

104
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,790
You both are
still awake?

105
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,730
We are unable
to sleep, mother.

106
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,570
Yudhisthir and Bhim
slept before you?

107
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,600
I will punish both of them
tomorrow morning.

108
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,570
Mother, I haven't slept.

109
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,690
We all are still awake.

110
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,630
The forest was calm
and peaceful, mother.

111
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,670
But there is no
peace here.

112
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,660
That's true, son.

113
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,760
Here the soldiers stay awake
all night and guard.

114
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,700
And the attendants in
the kitchen, stay up all night

115
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
and make preparations for
the next day's meals.

116
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,540
And brother Bhim is already
hungry again, mother.

117
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
It may be because you must
have eaten a lot.

118
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,600
You are not used to
the lunch here.

119
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,690
We haven't had yet.
Grandsire asked us...

120
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,530
What did your
grandsire say?

121
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,690
Nothing, mother.

122
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,690
The attendants here are
still unaware

123
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,500
that brother Bhim is
also called 'Vrikodar'.*
*'One with a wolf's belly'.

124
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,570
They served very little

125
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,590
and brother Bhim was
shy to ask for more.

126
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,630
Nothing else.

127
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,560
I will inform
the attendants tomorrow.

128
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,500
Okay.

129
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,590
Today you all

130
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,470
sleep here with me.

131
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,530
Mother

132
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,630
till when are we going
to stay here?

133
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,630
Nakul

134
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,690
we will now stay
here itself.

135
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,560
This is our home.

136
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,570
Mother, what kind
of a home is this?

137
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,630
Where no one even smiles
on seeing us.

138
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,540
It seems like
that we have refuge here

139
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,530
but no rights.

140
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,600
Who made you feel like this?

141
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,530
Everyone here is
unfamiliar.

142
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,630
Hence they are unpleasant.

143
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,630
The more we get acquainted
their love will increase.

144
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,370
Nakul. Sahadev.
Now, sleep.

145
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,590
It's such a big palace,
brother Bhim.

146
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,470
I have looked in
all the directions

147
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,640
but there is no path
leading to the kitchen.

148
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,400
You are of no use.

149
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,370
Just yesterday we had
been to the kitchen.

150
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,530
Even you had gone.
Do you remember?

151
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,490
You talk a lot.

152
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,470
Even Durbheeksh hasn't
come yet.

153
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,590
Or else he would have
shown me the way.

154
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,430
Greetings, Princes.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

155
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,560
Hey, mister.

156
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,540
Do you work in this palace?
- Yes, Prince.

157
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,560
Then you must be well
aware of this palace, right?

158
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,570
Which path leads
to the kitchen?

159
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,570
The kitchen!
That's very simple.

160
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,560
Go straight from here.

161
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,390
After going straight
turn towards the south.

162
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,560
Take ten steps south.

163
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,300
And then again turn
towards the east.

164
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
After turning towards
the east

165
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,340
go down towards
the west again.

166
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,400
After that you can use
your sense of smell

167
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,470
and you will know where
the kitchen is situated.

168
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,330
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

169
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,460
Nakul, did you
remember anything?

170
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,470
I feel that if we walk so
much in the forest

171
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,370
we will reach
the nearby village.

172
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,490
What do we do now?

173
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,430
This hunger is
killing me.

174
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,270
What happened?
- Nakul

175
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,390
that attendant has given
a unique solution.

176
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,340
Make use of
your nose.

177
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,430
I can smell raw mangoes.

178
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,460
Let's go.

179
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,400
Nakul

180
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,490
this is like heaven.

181
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,430
The food made by
the attendants

182
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,370
stands no equal to
the food made by God!

183
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,390
We have the rights
on this tree.

184
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,300
Find some other tree.

185
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,340
We have taken possession on
all the trees in this orchard.

186
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,470
Where will he
now find mangoes?

187
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,500
There are mango trees in
Kuntibhoj too!

188
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,390
If you want to eat mangoes, you
will have to travel till there.

189
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,490
I needn't travel!

190
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,460
If I want mangoes

191
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,360
I can take it from
your hands too.

192
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,430
If he wants mangoes he can
take it from our hands too!

193
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,270
You can definitely
take it from our hands.

194
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,460
What's the big deal
in that?

195
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,430
The weak have to beg!

196
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,290
Brother,
let me go.

197
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,230
No, Bhim, we are not
supposed to fight.

198
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,200
Come, I'll arrange lunch
for you.

199
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,270
Of course! The city is very big.
You can beg anywhere.

200
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,340
That's what your ascetic
father must have taught you!

201
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Now they have crossed
all limits, brother.

202
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,300
Forgiveness shouldn't be
to such an extent

203
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,400
that it becomes a sign
of weakness.

204
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,430
That's what father used
to say.

205
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,290
You're absolutely right, Arjun.

206
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
It is not appropriate to use
such words for our father.

207
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,230
Listen, everyone

208
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,130
my name is Vrikodar.

209
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
The tree that I shake...

210
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,170
All its fruits fall down.

211
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,130
Did you hear that, dear?

212
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,240
He has challenged

213
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,130
you and your brothers.

214
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,170
That when time comes
he can

215
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,160
kill you too.

216
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,100
He spoke about
killing us? - Definitely.

217
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,290
The tree that I shake...

218
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,330
All its fruits
fall down.

219
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,170
The interpretation is

220
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,160
that even if it be a mango tree
or a tree of lineage...

221
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,230
He will ensure all
fruits fall down.

222
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,230
Child!
My dear child!

223
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,040
This is politics.

224
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,060
You know that!

225
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,260
In the forests, whom do
the lion cubs fear most?

226
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
The other lions.

227
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Princes too

228
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,160
fear other princes.

229
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,190
What would be an
appropriate solution, uncle?

230
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,160
There is only one
solution, child.

231
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,260
The strategy that
Pandavs have made for you

232
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,000
make the same
strategy for them.
