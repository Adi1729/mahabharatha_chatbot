1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,170
Tomorrow herein

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,080
I shall step onto
the battlefield

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,020
as an undeterred warrior.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,020
With only triumph,
clenching my mind.

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,980
Sanjay, today grandsire

6
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,020
shall obliterate the Pandavas' army.

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,060
Assume that today,
is the final day of the war.

8
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,130
My sons
shall emerge victorious

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,890
while the Pandavas
will concede defeat.

10
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,110
Tell me. What is
happening on the battlefield?

11
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,120
The Pandava warriors are cooking
up a battle formation, my King.

12
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,040
Commander Dhrishtadyumna.

13
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,970
You, along with elder brother
shall confront Duryodhan

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,980
at the centerfield
of the battlefield.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,950
Bhima, Nakula, Sahadev.

16
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,920
Attack the forces
of the Kaurava, from the west.

17
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,080
It's your foremost
responsibility

18
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,020
to rebuff Lord Dronacharya.

19
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,030
King Virat, Abhimanyu and I

20
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,970
shall entice grandsire
into battle.

21
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,090
Brother, attack Duryodhan

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,070
the moment is vulnerable.

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,070
Soldiers, get to your
respective positions

24
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,010
at the earliest.

25
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,910
The battle formation
is about to commence.

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,090
Praise the lord!

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,150
Praise the lord!

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Praise the lord!

29
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,160
Praise the lord!

30
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030
Grandsire, declare
the battle formations to begin.

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,950
You had urged that you would
decimate the Pandava's army.

32
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,050
Incentives are not
achieved by formations

33
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,890
but by a sense of purpose,
Prince Duryodhan.

34
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,140
Why hasn't grandsire
created a formation, yet?

35
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,920
What if, like the first day

36
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,950
he is planning to attack
our army from both sides?

37
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,090
No, Arjun.

38
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,890
Grandsire is a
distinguished General.

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
The formations,
which his enemies can comprehend

40
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,000
he will never put up with the
same strategy again.

41
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,100
Moreover

42
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,110
war needs a formation

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,110
decimate doesn't have one.

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,150
Lord Dronacharya, you will stay
at the end of the battlefield.

45
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,130
And shall protect
Prince Duryodhan.

46
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,000
Prince Duryodhan!

47
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,940
You had questioned
my sense of duty.

48
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,140
Today, you shall view
with your own eyes

49
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,020
how I carry through,
my obligation.

50
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,990
Let's move, my friend.

51
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,100
Grandsire!

52
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,090
It's not your Grandsire,
Arjun.

53
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,160
It's Kaurava's accomplished general.

54
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,930
The proficient follower of duty.

55
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,000
The saviour of traditions.

56
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Lord Bhishma!

57
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,030
Pandava!

58
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,130
Get ready,
to engage with Bhishma.

59
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,010
Your army,
will not be allowed to surrender

60
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,020
nor could they take off
from the battlefield.

61
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,890
On this battlefield

62
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
the only thing they

63
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,160
could partake in, is death.

64
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,110
'The third day of war.'

65
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,060
Lord Bhishma had
caused us great many casualties.

66
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,070
With just nine attacks

67
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,080
he annihilated two
battalions of our soldiers.

68
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,070
I could feel for a while

69
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,150
that we weren't facing off
against the grandsire

70
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,890
rather the Lord of Death,
was present.

71
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,090
Pertaining yesterdays'
involvement, I thought

72
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,960
Grandsire was
against the Kauravas.

73
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,960
I thought he would
hold off our onslaught.

74
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,990
But wouldn't attack
us in return.

75
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,030
What could have
changed his mind?

76
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,040
His perception has changed,
Sahadev.

77
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,050
Fingers were raised against his
sense of duty.

78
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,110
Henceforth,

79
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,920
he is ready to embrace death

80
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,120
or embark upon, to take up ours.

81
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,890
Hereafter, from today,
our only objective

82
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,060
is the death of grandsire.

83
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,040
[MUSIC]

84
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,130
'Fourth day of the war.'

85
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,010
Your Grace, we just have four
battalions of soldiers left.

86
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,050
In just a day, Lord Bhishma
had thumped our forces.

87
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,020
And this is just the
fourth day of war.

88
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,920
It is impossible to
defeat grandsire.

89
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,160
Every potent individual
has tried his best.

90
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,960
But grandsire
has always triumphed.

91
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,940
If we do not stop grandsire

92
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,880
then he will
obliterate our armies.

93
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,330
Run!

94
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,570
Run!
Run!

95
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,400
Run!
Run!

96
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,330
'Fifth Day of the War.'

97
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,300
The funeral pyres of the enemies
are burning till the horizon

98
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,360
Your Highness.

99
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,480
The wailing of widowed women

100
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,540
is driving a stake through
the hearts of the sons of Pandu.

101
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,410
It seems as though

102
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,450
the torches in their camp
are spreading

103
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,550
darkness instead of light
today, Your Highness.

104
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,320
This very darkness will engulf
their fortune as well, Sanjay.

105
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,500
The power to revolt
against uncle

106
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,340
does not reside
in Lord Indra himself.

107
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,450
'Sixth Day of the War.'

108
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,380
Your Excellency

109
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,410
the Pandava army has been
reduced to three 'akshauhini.'

110
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,420
If you annihilate them

111
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,390
then the war will be over.

112
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,360
No,
Guru Drona.

113
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,460
This war

114
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,530
will not end

115
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,440
until Yudhishthir gets slain

116
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,570
and I must slay him.

117
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,300
'Seventh Day of the War.'

118
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,430
Seven days ago, we had
seven 'akshauhini' army with us

119
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,570
but now, we merely have
two 'akshauhini' army.

120
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,450
However, they still have nine
'akshauhini' army with them.

121
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,440
We tried to attack
grandsire numerous times

122
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,490
but were unsuccessful.

123
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,390
Can no one

124
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,290
revolt against grandsire,
Vasudev?

125
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,490
Every question has an answer,
brother Yudhishthir.

126
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,500
However, it is mandatory
to ask the right question

127
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,500
at the right time.

128
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,300
Vasudev, by the time
we await the right time

129
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,370
we will have no army with us.

130
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,440
We must slay grandsire
at any cost.

131
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,180
"Eighth Day of the War"

132
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,150
The valour of His Excellency
has left everyone perplexed

133
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,190
Your Highness.

134
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,350
For all these days,
neither has he eaten

135
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,390
nor slept a wink.

136
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Then how can such power

137
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,400
get generated in his aged self,
Your Highness?

138
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,280
This is not a war

139
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,320
but my uncle's meditation,
Sanjay.

140
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,390
Its fruits shall be reaped
by my sons.

141
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,150
Mother-in-law

142
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,210
why is great grandsire Bhishma
standing in the battlefield?

143
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,250
Does he not require food,
water and rest?

144
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,230
Grandsire is facing the
punishment of his actions, dear.

145
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,210
In this battlefield

146
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,340
each time he will slay someone

147
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:23,140
he too will experience death.

148
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,160
But why, mother-in-law?
What did he do?

149
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,240
His Excellency Bhishma

150
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,270
is the sentinel of the
Kuru dynasty in terms of

151
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,150
its memories, power
and righteousness.

152
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,170
However,
blinded by attachment

153
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,350
he allowed unrighteousness,
lies

154
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,230
and deception
to enter Hastinapur.

155
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,100
That is why, he is facing
this punishment today.

156
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,310
As long as
His Excellency is alive

157
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,280
neither will he be
able to sleep

158
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,310
nor take rest.

159
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,280
"Ninth Day of the War."

160
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,250
Renounce your weapons,
dear.

161
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,300
I do not wish to slay you!

162
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,260
Great grandsire,
I leave the camp each day

163
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,240
with the wish to die!
You may certainly slay me!

164
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,400
I am prepared.

165
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,130
Fight me, grandsire!

166
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,370
Give me the opportunity as well
to showcase my competence!

167
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,310
I am not here in the battlefield

168
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,170
to showcase my competence!

169
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,210
This war is my duty and
not my valour, dear!

170
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,290
I am helpless, Arjun!

171
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,200
Irrespective of
who attacks Hastinapur

172
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,140
I must slay him!
