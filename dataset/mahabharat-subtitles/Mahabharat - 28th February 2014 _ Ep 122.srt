1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,510
What is your name?

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,630
Vrushali!

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,630
Even we'll accompany you!
- Even we'll come with you...

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,440
Take us along...
- Brother.

5
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,660
Even we'll accompany you,
Your Highness!

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,470
Let's take them along.
- Even we'll come...

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,660
A city is not just made
of bricks and mortar!

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,670
We also need people.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,740
Even my friends
are coming along.

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,540
All hail, King Yudhisthir!
All hail, King Yudhisthir!

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,600
All hail, King Yudhisthir!
All hail, King Yudhisthir!

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,400
I am not at peace, uncle!

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,610
Why should I spare them
even a gravel of my land, uncle?

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,470
They are taking all
the subjects along with them.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,370
Why worry, my child?

16
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,630
People from the neighbouring
provinces

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,500
will settle in Hastinapur.

18
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,510
I'll get people from Gandhar

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,540
and settle them here.

20
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,470
People will come
and settle in cities.

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Keep your mind calm.

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,640
Concentrate on
the future plans, my child.

23
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,530
Think about your benefit!

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,570
Khandavprastha is barren!

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,400
Any human who ventures
into this land

26
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,340
is killed by
the serpent Takshak!

27
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,370
If Pandavas get killed by it,

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,570
then we benefit.

29
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,410
If the Pandavas kill Takshak

30
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,510
and
establish a city there

31
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,500
we'll benefit by that too!

32
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,310
How will that benefit us, uncle?

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,500
The cuckoo bird lays its eggs
in the crow's nest.

34
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,440
And when they hatch, the cuckoo
bird takes away the hatchlings.

35
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,300
The crow takes the pain

36
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,440
but the cuckoo stands to gain!

37
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,390
So consider that

38
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,470
Pandavas are toiling

39
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,440
in Khandavprastha for you!

40
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,410
If a city is established there

41
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,370
we'll snatch it

42
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,340
from the Pandavas!

43
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,470
Now even the ageing guardian

44
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,370
has been defeated, my child!

45
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,290
Mother!

46
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,430
I see myself surrounded
by just one question.

47
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,370
What sin have the ancestors
of the Kuru clan committed

48
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,410
which has caused their kingdom
to be bisected mercilessly?

49
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,340
What's the reason for it?

50
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,360
I am sure my question
is flawed, mother.

51
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,240
Else, why aren't you appearing
to eliminate my dilemma?

52
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,300
Tell me, mother.
Tell me!

53
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,170
Whose righteousness
is being slurred today?

54
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,370
Who has been defeated?

55
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,200
Who?

56
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,170
His Excellency Bhishma
will be defeated!

57
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,200
'Who are you?
Who invited you'

58
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,210
'to come here
and manifest your might?'

59
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,070
'I have already accepted
King Shalva as my husband!'

60
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,160
'You have won me by displaying
your might, in the courtroom.'

61
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,110
'Now, I will be wedded
only to Bhishma.'

62
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,040
'But this is impossible.'

63
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,160
'I have vowed to live
a life of celibacy.'

64
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,260
'And I have come here to
get that vow revoked, Bhishma!'

65
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,230
'You will have to bear
a much graver pain'

66
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,110
'than the pain I had to bear
because of you.'

67
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,210
'Whenever you are associated
with a noble task'

68
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,030
'and you wish for
Bhishma's death.'

69
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,060
'You will definitely be
the cause of Bhishma's death.'

70
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,070
'If so, I don't want to live!'

71
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,140
'But I will take a rebirth.'

72
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,070
'And when the vagaries of age'

73
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,130
'would have worn you
and your soul, out'

74
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,070
'then I will come.'

75
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,100
'As your death!'

76
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,100
'As your death!'

77
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
'As your death!'

78
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Or shall I say that

79
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,010
His Excellency Bhishma
is defeated?

80
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,030
The kingdom, for whose greatness
you committed so many sins

81
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,110
today you had to bisect
that very kingdom!

82
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,190
You're repenting for the sins

83
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,930
you committed in your life,
Bhishma!

84
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,900
Had it been so, then I would've
definitely repented, today.

85
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,130
But all my acts in the past

86
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,900
have always stood on the
pedestal of righteousness, Amba.

87
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,970
I gave up my life, in my last
birth, because of you, Bhishma.

88
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,930
During my last moments
I had told you

89
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,130
'The throne of Hastinapur, for
which you ruined my life'

90
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,930
'will make you struggle,
day in and day out!'

91
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,070
'That throne will never
let you be at peace!'

92
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,910
'You will struggle hard!
The throne will make you do so!'

93
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,940
And even today,
you are struggling!

94
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,870
If you haven't sinned, then
why are you being punished?

95
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,910
This is the punishment
for loving my family.

96
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,840
No, Bhishma!

97
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,100
It's the punishment for
disregarding others

98
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,930
for your selfish love.

99
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,840
Your love for your family made
you disregard the whole world!

100
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,830
You forgot, Bhishma.

101
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,070
That a hive becomes
a curse for a queen bee!

102
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,030
It cannot free itself
from the hive!

103
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,930
It dies painfully in a hive
filled with nectar!

104
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,900
You will meet the same fate,
Bhishma!

105
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,870
Your punishment has
just commenced, Bhishma.

106
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,900
Your family will punish you!

107
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,870
Your sins shall strike you
like lethal arrows

108
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,000
and tear you apart, Bhishma!

109
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,940
You will lie on a bed of arrows
and squirm!

110
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,930
And upon seeing the slaughter
around you

111
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,000
you'll yearn for death,
Bhishma!

112
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,960
You'll yearn!

113
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,700
And I will be present there.

114
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,770
Like a predator crushes
its prey in its jaws

115
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,740
and kilIs it, brutally

116
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,800
likewise,

117
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,780
I shall witness death crushing
you mercilessly, Bhishma!

118
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,830
This is Khandavprastha.
Our new kingdom.

119
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,990
This is Khandavprastha.

120
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,230
How can people
settle down here?

121
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,160
I've heard that
the land of this place

122
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,170
was burnt down
by snake's poison.

123
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,100
No, friend. It is a result of
Lord Indra's fury.

124
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,030
Lord Indra has granted
the snake Takshak a boon

125
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,190
according to which, he won't
cause rainfall on this land.

126
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,200
The rains would be limited
till the woods over there.

127
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,030
I hope we haven't made
a mistake by coming here.

128
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,030
There's no way that we can
return to Hastinapur now.

129
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,060
You all have come here believing
the ability of Pandavas, right?

130
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,090
Why are you upset then?

131
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,190
If Lord Indra is on
Takshak's side

132
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,000
then we have on our side

133
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,960
the godson of Lord Indra
Arjun.

134
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
What do you mean?

135
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,160
Everyone knows that each
son of King Pandu

136
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,030
is part of some God.

137
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,120
Kind Pandu was granted
these sons as boon by Gods.

138
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,130
So that the land of the Kurus
can be saved.

139
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,190
Son of Kind Pandu, Arjun
is Lord Indra's blessing.

140
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,160
Hence, do not worry.

141
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,130
This land would certainly turn
out to be fruitful for Pandavas.

142
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,990
Is this the state?

143
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,930
There are more trees even
underneath the sea water.

144
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,930
Those who love land,
are loved back by it.

145
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,090
I firmly believe

146
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,130
that this land will bring about
our glory and prosperity.

147
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,060
Just that we need to
work a little hard for it.

148
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,070
Only the servants
are going to work hard.

149
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,060
What did you just say?

150
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,930
Your Highness,
please forgive me.

151
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,930
I didn't say anything.

152
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,930
Charioteer, please stop.

153
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,860
Why are you afraid,
Vrushali?

154
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,930
Come closer.

155
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm not going to punish you.

156
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,660
What's the matter?

157
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,630
Why do you look
so worried and sad?

158
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,900
Your Highness, I...

159
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,630
I wasn't supposed to come here

160
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,860
but since father insisted...

161
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,770
Why weren't you supposed to
come here?

162
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,830
Don't be afraid, Vrushali.

163
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,700
No matter what your concerns

164
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,640
consider me as a friend
and tell me everything.

165
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,630
Actually...
Your Highness...

166
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,830
I like Hastinapur a lot,
Your Highness.

167
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,740
My friends, my home
and the amenities I desire...

168
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,660
Everything is over there.

169
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,830
Forsaking all that,
in this desolate place

170
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,730
why indeed have I come
to struggle for a life?

171
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,860
How would it benefit me?

172
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,640
You are here to contribute
to the making of a great empire.

173
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,590
It will be Duryodhan's reign
in Hastinapur

174
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,640
and here, it will be the Pandav
Yudhisthir's.

175
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,760
That empire will be yours.

176
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,740
Fame is found
only by the rulers.

177
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,670
The common folk

178
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,690
have mere struggles
in their fate, Your Highness.

179
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,630
That won't be the story here.

180
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,800
I assure you of that.

181
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,670
My husband will always be
righteous.

182
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,690
The empire won't be our property

183
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,660
rather it will be ruled as if
it were our heirloom.

184
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,640
All the rulers speak
of righteousness

185
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,600
but their righteousness
is only towards their families.

186
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,530
Speak of common folk
or ordinary people

187
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,570
and their sense of righteousness
becomes very stiff.

188
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,660
Be it the son of Dhritarashtra
or of Pandu

189
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,640
both are well alike,
Your Highness.

190
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,910
Your Highness,
if my words

191
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,880
amount to a death penalty

192
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,010
I would happily oblige.

193
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,850
Why would I sentence you
to death, friend?

194
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,080
Not only will we be fair
towards our subjects

195
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,080
but we'll also honour the right
of the serpents living here.

196
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,940
Just like different flavours
in food have their own place

197
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,820
all our subjects will have
their own rights and place.

198
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,010
Speaking of you...

199
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,810
You've taught me the definition
of an ideal empire.

200
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,940
You will never face any harm

201
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,040
or pain.

202
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,780
Takshak

203
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,970
the Pandavas
and their subjects are here.
