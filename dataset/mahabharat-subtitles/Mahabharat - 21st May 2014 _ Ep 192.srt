1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Greetings, aunt!

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Bless you.

3
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,940
Greetings, Grand sire!
- Bless you, child.

4
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,780
Greetings, Minister!

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,770
Bless you, child.

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,810
Greetings, Sage Drona.
- Greetings.

7
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:54,820
[MUSIC]

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,970
Greetings, uncle.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,740
Bless you, Krishna.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,940
Greetings, Duryodhan.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,770
Greetings, Krishna.

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,770
Welcome, Krishna.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,870
I've arranged for your stay

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,870
and refreshments at my palace.

15
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,970
No, Duryodhan.

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,740
I am here with a peace treaty.

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,710
I am not here to stay.

18
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,780
I can't stay at your palace.

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,940
Don't you trust us, Krishna?

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,810
If trust is all you wanted

21
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,900
then you could've asked
for my advice

22
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,800
and not a treaty.

23
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,800
I shall stay
at Minister Vidhur's place.

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,750
See you at the court tomorrow.

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,870
Greetings, Krishna.

26
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,670
Greetings, Karna.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,710
I am impressed
with your archery.

28
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,840
Like Lord Karthikeya* and Lord Ganesha
*Karthikeya, a war god, second son of Shiva and Parvathi, and the younger brother of Ganesha (the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom).

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,840
you and Parth
bring pride to the Arya clan.

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,770
If you both form a nexus

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,880
then the reign of righteousness
would prevail among the clan.

32
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,740
Karthikeya and Ganesh

33
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,650
would never stay
in Kailash together.

34
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,680
I hope you're aware of it.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,770
Goddess Parvati
was unfortunate that way.

36
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,610
We are fortunate that we are
not siblings.

37
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,800
I shall fight a battle
with Arjun.

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Doesn't this peace treaty
make you happy?

39
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,680
Why do I need to wage
a war to combat Arjun?

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,700
I can call him
for a war anytime.

41
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,740
Thwarting such a catastrophe

42
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,530
would be the right thing to do.

43
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,740
I congratulate you.

44
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,770
I can see that you
advocate righteousness.

45
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,550
Why do you emphasize
on warfare then?

46
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,480
Krishna, let's go.

47
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,500
Rashavi, is that all?

48
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,670
What about the sweet meat?

49
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,670
Apologies, Krishna!

50
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,440
After the warfare meeting

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,510
we've been eating
such plain food.

52
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,610
Bitter leaves for the bitterness
that's spread around Hastinapur.

53
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,480
Dry bread for the dryness
that's spread around.

54
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,640
I wanted to make sweets for you

55
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,440
but sister stopped me.

56
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,670
Why so, aunt?

57
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,600
I love sweets.

58
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,640
Krishna!

59
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,480
I can almost see
Kuru Dynasty ruin.

60
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,500
On one hand I think

61
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,380
such a warfare must be avoided.

62
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,470
On the other hand I feel

63
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,380
that justice
shouldn't be denied

64
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,440
at any cost.

65
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,380
Keeping calm

66
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,480
under these circumstances
is impossible, Krishna.

67
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,380
One needs to feel
happiness, aunt.

68
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,410
It can never be attained.

69
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,510
One who seeks happiness
out of materialism

70
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,410
seldom attains happiness.

71
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,570
One whose happiness
lies in power and wealth

72
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,450
invites ruin for himself.

73
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,480
Kuru Dynasty
is destined to be ruined.

74
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,350
King Dhritarashtra
never understood

75
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,540
what true happiness is.

76
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,510
His sons too

77
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,440
sought happiness
in power, wealth

78
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,570
and satiating their arrogance.

79
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,430
Will the entire dynasty
be doomed?

80
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
Can't you save anyone?

81
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,400
Of course they will be saved.

82
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,310
Justice and righteousness
shall prevail.

83
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,340
Elements that have to be
destroyed will be destroyed.

84
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,470
Ones that have to be saved
shall remain safe.

85
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,410
That's why I said

86
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,310
that happiness
needs to be understood

87
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,270
and it can't be attained.

88
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,440
Here!

89
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,340
Let me relish the sweets
that you've prepared.

90
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,370
Tomorrow at the court

91
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,380
everyone will be rewarded
according to their perspective.

92
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

93
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,140
Bless you, Krishna.

94
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,200
I welcome...

95
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,210
The mightiest Yadava
on the land of Hastinapur.

96
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,170
Krishna

97
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,280
the Kuru Dynasty is on
the threshold of ruin.

98
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,270
Like one realises darkness
when night befalls

99
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,080
I can sense Kuru Dynasty's doom

100
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,210
when I see my elders anxious.

101
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,300
Vasudev

102
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,240
only you can show us the way

103
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,140
to stop this battle.

104
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,080
Please, show us a way.

105
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,180
Long live the King!

106
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,270
Your Highness

107
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,110
return the Pandavas'
kingdom to them

108
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,150
and make your sons ready
for repentance and punishment.

109
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,010
I promise you that they
will not lose their lives.

110
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,150
But they will have to let go
of their pride.

111
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,080
If this is acceptable to you

112
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,080
then the battle
can be averted.

113
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,390
Vasudev!

114
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,300
I am the rightful ruler
of Indraprastha

115
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,360
the King isn't.

116
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,170
Under no circumstances

117
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,290
will I return Indraprastha.

118
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,100
And as long as the Pandavas

119
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,360
aren't the rulers
of Indraprastha

120
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,100
they have no right
to battle anyone, Vasudev.

121
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,240
Everyone has the right
to fight against injustice

122
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,260
Prince.

123
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,330
It's the Pandavas' generosity

124
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,200
that they haven't started
a battle with you so far.

125
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,140
They respected the King
at every step.

126
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,100
Actually

127
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,230
the end of a state
is ensured

128
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,300
by its very beginning.

129
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,100
A margosa tree
never yields mangoes.

130
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,160
Your Highness

131
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,140
even this battle
began the very day

132
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,070
that King Pandu died
in that forest

133
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,300
and his sons arrived
at Hastinapur.

134
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,070
Had you announced
Prince Yudhishthir

135
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,300
to be the Crown Prince
that very day

136
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,200
then this circumstance
wouldn't have arisen.

137
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,270
But you were unable to overcome
your attachment

138
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,130
towards the royal throne.

139
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,000
What kind

140
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,030
of language

141
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,190
are you using,
Vasudev?

142
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,260
Have you come
to propose peace

143
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,000
or to declare a battle?

144
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,070
King of Gandhar

145
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,070
only he who benefits from lies

146
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,200
considers the truth an insult.

147
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,240
But the truth is that,
Vasudev...

148
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,070
That only the king's son
becomes the next king.

149
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,190
But you are a temporary king.

150
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,130
The truth is

151
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,990
that your coronation
never took place.

152
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,200
So, how do your sons

153
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
have any right to the throne?

154
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,130
What is the point of digging up
the past

155
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,130
Your Highness?

156
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,120
Vasudev

157
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,070
the truth is that at the end
of the game of dice

158
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,160
the Pandavas had accepted

159
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,930
that they will live in
anonymity for one year.

160
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,040
But before the completion
of that one year, Duryodhan

161
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,090
had found Arjun.

162
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,960
We are ready to free

163
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,190
the Pandavas from their exile.

164
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,000
Only if they give up
the idea of a battle.

165
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,970
Even sinning in the courtyard
of a temple

166
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,990
does not convert the sin
into a good deed

167
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,130
King of Gandhar.

168
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,160
That very game of dice
was unlawful.

169
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,000
So, its results are meaningless.

170
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,070
Vasudev

171
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,940
did brother Yudhishthir
not stake his property

172
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,090
his brothers, his wife

173
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,940
and himself, voluntarily?

174
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,970
So, how could it
be unlawful, Vasudev?

175
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,870
By trying to disrobe
a woman at this court

176
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,900
you had turned the whole
proceeding unlawful, Prince.

177
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,090
No one asks which morsel

178
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,990
has poisoned the body.

179
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,970
The whole food is considered
poisonous.

180
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,940
Even I was unarmed

181
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
at the court of Indraprastha.

182
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,840
Have you forgotten that,
Vasudev?

183
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,030
When you were unarmed
at that court

184
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,000
why did you not declare
war right then, Prince?

185
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,000
Why did you conspire
to disrobe a woman

186
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,970
at the court,
during the game of dice?

187
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,060
The truth is

188
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,800
that you are incapable
of battling them.

189
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,030
Vasudev, even
His Excellency Bhishma

190
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,140
was present at the game of dice

191
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,100
along with Guru Drona.

192
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,100
Did they sin as well?

193
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,030
Yes, they did.

194
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,200
When the whole house
is crumbling

195
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,030
the gatekeepers cannot
just protect the door

196
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,090
King of Gandhar.

197
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,240
When someone is committing
a crime against society

198
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,040
against humanity

199
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,070
just protecting your own duty

200
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,070
results in a disaster.

201
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,260
I cannot support

202
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,030
this strange
sense of duty.

203
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,160
This is not the time
to have this debate.

204
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,230
Right now, we must
concentrate on trying to avert

205
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,990
this great battle.

206
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,230
And that's why, I have come
as a messenger of peace.

207
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,960
This message

208
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,190
is not acceptable to me.

209
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,100
If you leave this court now, Prince...

210
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,990
I will meet him next
only on the battle field

211
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,090
Your Highness.

212
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
Duryodhan.

213
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,970
Wait.

214
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,090
Vasudev

215
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,930
by talking of punishment

216
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,160
you made the message of peace
unacceptable.

217
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,900
How can any warrior
accept punishment?

218
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,930
Which warrior tries to disrobe
a woman from his own family

219
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,060
at the royal court,
Your Highness?

220
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,030
What does fearing punishment

221
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,130
after committing a crime, mean?

222
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,060
But still

223
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,970
I promise you

224
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,090
that if the culprits
touch Draupadi's feet

225
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,000
and ask for forgiveness

226
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,970
then they Pandavas will treat it
as a punishment.
