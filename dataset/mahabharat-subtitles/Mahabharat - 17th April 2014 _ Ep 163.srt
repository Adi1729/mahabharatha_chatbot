1
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,150
Will you come
to aid us again, Govind?

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,190
Indeed

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
but

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,260
I will not be able
to aid all of you

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,020
where you are headed
at the moment.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,220
All of you must succeed in the
life of anonymity on your own.

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,210
The time for your life of
anonymity is drawing closer too.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,060
Which place would be appropriate
for our life of anonymity

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,090
Vasudev?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,210
Brother Yudhishthir
is the Emperor.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
The entire Aryan region
knows him.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,150
Brother

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,280
the most difficult task for man
is to remain hidden

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,020
because in order to remain so

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,020
one must first expunge
oneself of one's arrogance

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,990
and forget one's competence

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,020
one's respect

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,090
one's class

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,150
and one's existence.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,990
If family and friends

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,190
fuel your arrogance

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,990
then none of you
will forget who you are

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,020
and if the enemy
challenges your arrogance

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,150
then you are bound to get angry

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,190
and show yourselves
to the world.

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,990
You must choose a place

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,150
where no one recognizes you.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,990
A place where you will get love

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,210
but not get attached to anyone.

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,180
If someone does insult you

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,120
you ought to be able
to pardon that person.

32
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,120
Where can such
a place be, Vasudev?

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,150
In this vast Aryan region

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,990
there must be a King

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,920
who you are not acquainted with.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,540
In this vast Aryan region, there
is only one such King, Vasudev.

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,080
The person I am
alluding to is King Virat.

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,120
Yes.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,880
Only in the Matsya kingdom* of King Virat will all of you
*Matsya ("fish") is located south of the Kurus, and west of the Yamuna river which separated it from the kingdom of Panchalas.

40
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,950
be able to

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,150
safely lead a life of anonymity.

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
Certainly, Vasudev.

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,980
The day Arjun returns after
completing his meditation

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,890
we shall proceed
towards the Matsya kingdom.

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,020
He shall return soon after
succeeding in his endeavour.

46
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,090
Arjun has such
a strong determination

47
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,010
that he can achieve

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,080
even the most arduous
of meditations.

49
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,050
'The animal shown in this scene'

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,110
'was generated
using computer graphics.'

51
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,010
You seem to be the indigenous tribe of Kirat.*
*The Kirati or Kiranti people in the Himalayas (mid-hills) extending eastward from Nepal into India, Burma and beyond.

52
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Who are you?

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,910
I am meditating here.

54
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,980
Let me take my arrow out.

55
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,780
You can take this warthog then.

56
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,810
I shall indeed take it away.

57
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,750
I was hunting it after all.

58
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,780
So, I shall take it away.

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,820
Pardon me

60
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,860
but this animal was killed
by my arrow

61
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,010
and not yours.

62
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,810
You may certainly take it away.

63
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,920
He insulted you,
Your Highness!

64
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,750
He said that he
hunted that animal!

65
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,020
Then he must certainly be
stronger than you.

66
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,720
He is a better archer than you.

67
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,910
Since you are the King,
you must demonstrate

68
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,980
that you are the stronger one
and not him!

69
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,720
I am Arjun,
the son of Pandu.

70
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,880
I am more skilled
than a tribal person.

71
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,680
The son of Pandu!

72
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,780
Such arrogance!

73
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,850
Can you see that hollow
on that tree?

74
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,750
You must pierce it.

75
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,720
I had killed this warthog

76
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,850
with such lightning speed.

77
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,810
You must not have
even seen my arrow.

78
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,750
The focus required
to be a great archer

79
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,580
does not reside in you.

80
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,850
Can you fight using a sword?

81
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,850
A true warrior is one

82
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,720
who can use
all weapons proficiently.

83
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,750
Pick up the sword,
Prince.

84
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,590
Do you accept defeat?

85
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,510
Are you not tired yet?

86
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
No

87
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,510
I am not tired

88
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,650
but when Lord Shiva
himself is one's opponent

89
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,450
how can a person win?

90
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,520
Being a disciple of guru Drona

91
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,480
no tribal man
can ever withstand

92
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,420
my attacks for so long.

93
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,390
Lord Pinaka*
*Vishwakarma.

94
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,390
had made the first bow known as Pinak*
*Shiva's bow.

95
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,650
and had taught the entire world
the art of archery.

96
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,350
Punish me for
my mistakes, My Lord

97
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,550
and please do appear
in your true form.

98
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,370
Bless you!

99
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,240
Lord Indra requested me

100
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,240
to give his son the knowledge
of Pashupatastra.

101
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,400
However, without testing
your worthiness

102
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,270
I could not give you
the Pashupatastra.

103
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,440
A person who is worthy

104
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
knows divinity in a moment.

105
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,330
The truth is

106
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,300
the one who recognizes
the greatness of others

107
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,400
is truly worthy

108
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,430
but My Lord

109
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,140
I could not recognize you.

110
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,280
I must certainly not be worthy.

111
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,330
Lord Indra

112
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,280
your son has
acknowledged himself

113
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,380
that he is not worthy
of acquiring the Pashupatastra.

114
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,370
A person who
deems himself worthy

115
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,180
is not truly so,
My Lord.

116
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,300
Worthiness can be truly known

117
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,370
only by the person
taking the test.

118
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,230
You have the ability to become
truly worthy, son of Kunti.

119
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,200
I am pleased with you.

120
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,230
I shall teach you how to
use the Pashupatastra.

121
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,330
It is not a weapon

122
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,300
but knowledge.

123
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,310
Falling prey to unrighteousness,
when the enemy becomes weak

124
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,110
he can be killed using
ordinary weapons, son of Kunti.

125
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,270
However,
often times

126
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,130
one has to kill an enemy
who is also righteous.

127
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,210
It is impossible to kill such
enemies with ordinary weapons.

128
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,330
The ones who walk
on the righteous path

129
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,330
are blessed with
my refuge after death.

130
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,080
I have made such
a promise to the world.

131
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,070
That is why,
the Pashupatastra brings

132
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,140
the people who have always
walked on the righteous path

133
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,330
to my refuge after death.

134
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,230
You shall receive
the Pashupatastra now.

135
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,300
Bless you!

136
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,270
Twelve years are
almost over, uncle.

137
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,230
Today

138
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,200
before dusk

139
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,080
we must find those Pandavas

140
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,200
and stop them from
leading a life of anonymity.

141
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,010
When the last ray of the sun
fades into darkness

142
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,010
the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas will begin.

143
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,070
When will we abduct
Draupadi, uncle?

144
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,170
My darling, Arjun
has not returned yet.

145
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,230
But I have a feeling,
uncle

146
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,200
that Arjun will return
before dusk today.

147
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,100
I have firm faith
that he will return

148
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,940
but at the moment

149
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,110
the might of the Pandavas
is not that considerable.

150
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,200
Before Arjun returns

151
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,070
we must abduct Draupadi.

152
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
But how is that
possible, uncle?

153
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,110
We cannot attack the Pandavas.

154
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,970
We are bound by
our promise, uncle.

155
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,040
We cannot attack them

156
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,100
but

157
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,170
your sister

158
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,010
Dushala's husband

159
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,010
King of Sindhu, Jayadrath,
most certainly can, my darling.

160
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
I

161
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,010
have come here
to aid you, Duryodhan.

162
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,720
We cannot attack them

163
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,520
but

164
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,620
your sister

165
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,730
Dushala's husband

166
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,720
King of Sindhu, Jayadrath,
most certainly can, my darling.

167
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,550
I

168
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,690
have come here
to aid you, Duryodhan.

169
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,560
Now...

170
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Now

171
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,460
I have promised your sister

172
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,550
that I shall

173
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,490
indeed aid you.

174
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,550
Welcome,
King of Sindhu.

175
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Be seated.

176
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,650
I am grateful to you

177
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,590
for coming here to aid me

178
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,430
but these four Pandavas

179
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,460
never leave their wife Draupadi

180
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,410
by herself.

181
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,390
One of them

182
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,430
is always present
to protect Draupadi.

183
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,490
Four of them!

184
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,460
I can defeat 400 Pandavas
in one go

185
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,580
and abduct Draupadi.

186
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,480
King of Sindhu

187
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,620
you are Dushala's husband

188
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,530
and the son-in-law
of Hastinapur's royal family.

189
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,560
That is why, I do not
wish to insult you.

190
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,520
However, a frog cannot
inflate its throat

191
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,450
and become the size of a bull.

192
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,410
King of Sindhu

193
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,360
I think the competence
of the Pandavas

194
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,380
is something
you are not aware of.

195
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,580
Duryodhan

196
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,390
you are my brother-in-law.

197
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,490
That is why,
I have

198
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,330
not given you a demonstration
of my competence yet

199
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,460
otherwise...

200
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,450
And

201
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,520
may the Almighty never
give rise to such a situation

202
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,450
King of Sindhu.

203
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,550
You are correct.

204
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,490
You are not only
free to attack them

205
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,360
but also competent enough

206
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,480
but

207
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,520
I have a solution

208
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,480
using which you will not have to

209
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,550
engage in a battle.

210
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,290
Yudhishthir

211
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,380
performs

212
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,420
the 'Sandhyavandana'* every morning
*Salutation to twilight (dawn and dusk) or solar noon.

213
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,290
by going to a river bank.

214
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,310
Bheem

215
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,360
and Sahadev

216
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,450
go to the village
to distribute alms

217
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,290
to the poor.

218
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
That leaves Nakul.

219
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,450
Every day,
for 90 minutes

220
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,310
he is given the duty

221
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,260
of protecting Draupadi
all by himself.

222
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
If we can

223
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,380
somehow

224
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,350
keep Nakul

225
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,390
away from the hut

226
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,290
then without having to fight

227
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,450
you can abduct Draupadi.
