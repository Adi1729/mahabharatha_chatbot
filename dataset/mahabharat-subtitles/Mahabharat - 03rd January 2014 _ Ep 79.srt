1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,960
Along with lac,
this palace is made

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,960
with dried grass,
clarified butter and cotton.

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,930
If this palace catches fire

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,900
everything will get burnt
within six hours.

5
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,000
This is a scheme to burn
us alive in the palace.

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,800
Father

7
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,830
the remaining Pandavas
have figured out

8
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,870
that the entire palace
is made of lac.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,940
Purandiri, seek permission
from Her Highness

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,960
to go and get more food
from the kitchen.

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,800
You have my permission.
You may go and get it.

12
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,770
But we have already given them
all the food, My Lord.

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,960
Be quiet.
Our plan has been foiled.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,930
We must torch this place.

15
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,860
We must get out of here at once!

16
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,970
Let's go.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,960
We need to discuss
this with mother.

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,930
But I do not understand,
brother Yudhishthir.

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,830
What must have Duryodhan
thought about this place?

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,860
If this place is torched,
will we not be able to escape?

21
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,690
Is he a fool?

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,700
Brother Arjun can extinguish
an entire forest fire

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,930
using a single 'Varunastra'.*
*The water weapon (a storm) incepted by Varuna--the god of the water and of the celestial ocean, as well as a god of law of the underwater world.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,660
He might not have
thought about it.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,900
He did.

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,900
He has put quite a bit
of thought into it, brother.

27
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,660
The mouse died
upon eating the 'kheer'.

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,600
Mother, begin eating.

29
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,760
They must be on their way.

30
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,630
No, let them arrive.

31
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,670
At least, allow me to feed you
some 'kheer', mother.

32
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,700
No, Bheem.
You may have it.

33
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,830
Besides, a mother eats only when
her children are done eating.

34
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,290
No, mother. You must allow me
to feed you some 'kheer'.

35
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,190
Alright.
Go ahead.

36
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,290
But I have a fear, mother.

37
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,060
When you feed me,
I feel satiated.

38
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,140
What if I feel satiated
upon feeding you?

39
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,190
That is impossible,
my Vrikodar.

40
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,260
If that happens, I shall not be
able to eat when you feed me.

41
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,270
And I have committed no sin

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,140
that the Almighty will
punish me that harshly.

43
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,030
Now, feed me.

44
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,170
Open your mouth.

45
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,160
That 'kheer' has been
poisoned, mother!

46
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,970
Yes, mother.
The mouse died upon eating it.

47
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,970
Mother, get up. This palace
might get torched any moment.

48
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,930
I do not understand.

49
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,000
Brother, this palace
is made with lac.

50
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,960
Poisoning all of us first

51
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,160
and then torching this place
were all part of a scheme!

52
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,060
That way, everyone would think
that we died in an accident.

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,970
But... - This is not the time
to talk, brother Bheem.

54
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,160
We must first catch
that Purochan!

55
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,060
And then we will
take him to Hastinapur.

56
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,090
Let's go.
Let's go, mother.

57
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,170
Let's go.

58
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,930
Never did I imagine

59
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,130
that brother Duryodhan
would try to kill us!

60
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,870
Couldn't you imagine
such a thing, Sahadev?

61
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,030
Then your power of imagination
is very weak!

62
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,970
Did you forget?

63
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,090
He had poisoned me.

64
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
But we were children back then.

65
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,030
Children do many things
without thinking straight.

66
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,070
How could he do it now?
- I will crush Duryodhan's head

67
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,930
brother Yudhishthir!

68
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,930
I have heard that
when death approaches

69
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,830
a deer makes its way
to a lion's den on its own.

70
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,040
I think, Duryodhan's doom
is calling out to him.

71
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,960
'Taste this 'kheer',
brother Bheem.'

72
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,890
'You 5 brothers will touch
the feet of us 100 brothers.'

73
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,900
'Right now!'

74
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,800
'And forever after.'

75
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,990
'Mother, what kind
of a place is this?'

76
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,070
'No one seems happy
upon our arrival here.'

77
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,940
'It seems like
we are refugees here'

78
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,870
'and have no right
to this place.'

79
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,060
'Certainly.
This is a big kingdom.'

80
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,890
'You can ask for food
from anyone.'

81
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,900
'That is what your mendicant of
a father must have taught you.'

82
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,030
'Yudhishthir'

83
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
'the blood of which dynasty
runs through your veins?'

84
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,840
'From whom did your
characterless mother'

85
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,030
'conceive you?'

86
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,790
'Very soon'

87
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,930
'the reason of your worry'

88
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,800
'will come to an end,
brother Bheem.'

89
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,060
'You 5 brothers will touch
the feet of us 100 brothers.'

90
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,770
'Right now!
- It seems like...'

91
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,800
'And forever after.
-...we are refugees here...'

92
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,770
'Mother, what kind
of a place is this?'

93
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,840
'Certainly.
This is a big kingdom.'

94
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,990
'You can ask for food
from anyone.'

95
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,800
'That is what your mendicant of
a father must have taught you.'

96
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,960
'Very soon,
the reason of your worry'

97
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,800
'will come to an end,
brother Bheem.'

98
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,800
Brother Bheem is correct,
brother Yudhishthir.

99
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,770
If we do not draw
our weapons even now

100
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,770
we will be termed
as cowards and weaklings.

101
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,960
Just give me the order,
brother Yudhishthir!

102
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,900
I await it!

103
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,030
Do not give them any order,
Yudhishthir.

104
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,700
What are you saying, mother?

105
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,770
How can we calm down?

106
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,930
Duryodhan has schemed
to burn us alive.

107
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,960
He schemed to burn you,
our mother!

108
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,730
If that is the case, sons

109
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,670
then all of us

110
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,940
shall burn to ashes here.

111
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,760
They conspired to kill my sons!

112
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,630
Such hatred...

113
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,790
Such animosity harbours in them!

114
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
No, sons.

115
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,730
Going to Hastinapur now

116
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,840
is not an option any longer.

117
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,790
Going to Hastinapur now

118
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,730
is not an option any longer.

119
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,700
The gates of that kingdom

120
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,670
are closed for us now.

121
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,790
What are you saying, mother?

122
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,700
Why should we not go there?
It is our home.

123
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,570
A home is made up
of a family, son.

124
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,500
A place filled with enemies
is not a home

125
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,670
but a camp in a war.

126
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,590
Death looms in such a place.

127
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,590
Anger pervades such a place.

128
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,670
Doubt infests
such a place.

129
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,630
It feels like hell
in such a place, son.

130
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,540
We cannot live
in a place like that.

131
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,760
But, mother, brother Yudhishthir
is the Crown Prince

132
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,670
and he has the right
to the throne.

133
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,490
We have no greed for polity.

134
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
We do not want any throne!

135
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,590
Your father had
renounced polity himself

136
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,600
and resided in a forest.

137
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,470
Did you forget that?

138
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,730
You were even born
in a forest.

139
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,690
It was a forest

140
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,630
where sages would meditate.

141
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,590
There was no misery.

142
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,640
We did not go to Hastinapur
asking for our rights.

143
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,590
We had gone there

144
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,430
asking for a family.

145
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,460
We had gone there seeking the
love and respect of that family.

146
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,600
If we do not have
any right to their love

147
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,530
then what is the point
of the right to the throne?

148
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,670
Yudhishthir

149
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,640
if Duryodhan wants polity

150
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,640
then let go of it, son.

151
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,540
But, mother,
what about justice?

152
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,630
Duryodhan tried
to kill you, mother!

153
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,630
Right now, my blood is boiling
like an erupting volcano!

154
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,370
I would be a disgrace if I
do not punish Duryodhan!

155
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,600
What punishment will you
give Duryodhan?

156
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,500
When Bheem was poisoned

157
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,500
what punishment was
given to Duryodhan?

158
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,470
King Dhritarashtra has
forgotten at the moment

159
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,560
that a King is the father
of all his subjects.

160
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,400
Right now, he is just a father
of his 100 sons.

161
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,430
Duryodhan will receive
no punishment, Arjun.

162
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,370
He will receive no punishment.

163
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,300
The one to be punished

164
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,330
will be me.

165
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,430
I will be punished, son.

166
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,400
All of you are capable.

167
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,490
You can revolt
against Hastinapur.

168
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,530
But if that happens

169
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,560
then my husband's soul
will grieve in heaven.

170
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,560
And if you do not revolt
against Hastinapur

171
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,500
then we will have to live
with such conspiracies.

172
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,370
Day and night

173
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,290
I will be plagued with doubts.

174
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,390
The only property I have with me

175
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,530
are the five sons of mine.

176
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,580
Among the five of you

177
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,510
the mere possibility of

178
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,580
any of you dying will be like
going through hell to me.

179
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,380
Do you wish to see me

180
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,420
face the atrocities of hell

181
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,610
in every moment
of the rest of my life?

182
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,340
And son

183
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,510
Duryodhan...

184
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,480
Duryodhan needs to succeed
just once, son.

185
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,570
Just once.

186
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,350
We will never let him
succeed, mother!

187
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,380
Never!
- They will succeed!

188
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,540
They certainly will!

189
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,580
If you stay there, you will
lose your peace of mind!

190
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,350
Duryodhan will compel you
to conspire against him.

191
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,540
He will extinguish
your righteousness!

192
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,320
In other words, you will
either lose your life or morals.

193
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,540
But, I

194
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,540
will lose in both the cases.

195
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,280
Now, you decide, sons

196
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,320
if the news of all of you dying
will award me misery for life

197
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,410
or righteousness dying within
you will award me the same.

198
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,280
What kind of a punishment
have all of you chosen for me?

199
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,470
Answer me.

200
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,440
Answer me!

201
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,340
When your tears
are that of joy, mother

202
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,140
it is like a plunge
into the Holy Ganges to us.

203
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,250
But when they are
that of sorrow

204
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,180
it is like a plunge
into the fire to us, mother.

205
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,280
Mother, this is
such a big world.

206
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,310
Why would we choose a place

207
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
where our mother
would neither be in peace

208
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,340
nor be contented?

209
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,210
Why would we
do such a thing, mother?

210
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,340
Why would we?

211
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,310
If it is your order

212
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,170
then we shall certainly
not return to Hastinapur.

213
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,280
No one will even know
that we are alive.
