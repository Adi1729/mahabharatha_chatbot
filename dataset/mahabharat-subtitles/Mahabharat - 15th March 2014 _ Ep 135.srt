1
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,250
Greetings, Prince Balaram!

2
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,350
You are welcome.

3
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,220
Excuse me,
King Shakuni

4
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,360
my intent wasn't to insult my
dear disciple Duryodhana or you.

5
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,350
No, Prince Balaram

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,120
we have no spite against you.

7
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,280
If you have to apologise

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,220
please do so
to your dear sister Subhadra.

9
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,260
I didn't quite catch your drift.

10
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,220
Prince Balaram

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,090
if a flower, instead of
adorning a deity's feet

12
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,350
graces the locks of a dancer

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,190
the happing
doesn't insult the deity.

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,180
It's but
the flower's misfortune.

15
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,160
King Shakuni!

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,250
Don't be angry with me,
Prince Balaram.

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,090
I am innocent.

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,190
Do you know?

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,320
When Drupad's daughter

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,220
had to marry the five Pandavas

21
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,180
she had taken a vow

22
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,260
from these brothers

23
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,250
that they can surely marry
a second time

24
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,080
but can't get their second wife

25
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,160
to Indraprastha.

26
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,150
There's just one queen
in Indraprastha.

27
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,130
High Queen Draupadi.

28
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,280
No one else.

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,220
Now you can

30
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,990
decide for yourself.

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,250
Your dear sister Subhadra

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,160
will spend her entire life here.

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,090
But, yes, whenever Arjun wishes

34
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,160
he will surely come to meet
your dear sister.

35
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,960
What dignity
will she be left with?

36
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,060
The entire Aryan nation
will mock at you.

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,990
You are my friend

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,080
and the guru
of dear Duryodhana.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,060
That's why I say so.

40
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,990
If you doubt my words

41
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,190
ask him yourself.

42
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,150
So hang, Prince Balaram.

43
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,920
Vasudev.

44
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,090
King Shakuni.

45
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,920
Prince Arjun, if what
King Shakuni said is true

46
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,090
I can't put my sister in
such an unfortunate situation.

47
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,090
Neither will I tolerate
such insult to the Yadavs.

48
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,930
You have two options
in front of you.

49
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,130
Either stay in Dwarka forever

50
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,020
or else, my sister

51
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,920
shall start off for Indraprastha
right now, along with you.

52
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,120
Greetings, High Queen.

53
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,090
Prince Arjun is returning
after completing his penance.

54
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,020
His Highness has ordered
to be present at the town gates

55
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,990
to welcome him.

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,930
For the sake of the welcome
of the new bride

57
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,050
he has also asked to bring
along the veneration platter.

58
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,810
New bride?

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,020
Prince Arjun is arriving
with his wife

60
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,020
Princess Subhadra.

61
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,850
Prince!

62
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,990
You have broken the marital vow!

63
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,860
You have shattered my trust.

64
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,760
You and your wife

65
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,790
don't have the rights
to enter the town!

66
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,880
Panchali!

67
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,810
Panchali!

68
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,750
Panchali!

69
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,660
Greetings, brother Yudhisthir.

70
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,890
Be blessed, Arjun.

71
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,690
You have hurt Panchali.

72
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,920
I was helpless, brother.

73
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,720
Brother-in-law Balaram
ordered me

74
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,760
that post the wedding

75
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,880
either I take Subhadra
along with me

76
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,730
or reside in Dwarka forever.

77
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,690
And mother had ordered me
to return to Indraprastha

78
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,750
and help you in
the Rajsuya Yajna.

79
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,680
But what is the solution now,
brother Yudhisthir?

80
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,750
Draupadi's words are apt.

81
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,820
Arjun's quandary
is as legitimate.

82
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,630
Brother Yudhisthir, we must try
to convince Panchali.

83
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,680
Come, Arjun.

84
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,690
I believe Panchali will
surely heed to us.

85
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,620
'No matter where we live,
there will be just one queen.'

86
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,820
'And that
will be Princess Draupadi.'

87
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,790
'That's our vow.'

88
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,820
'We pledge that we shall
always bide by our vow.'

89
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,520
Panchali.

90
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Your orders, Your Highness.

91
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,650
Not an order,
rather it's a request, Panchali.

92
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,520
Please think on the situation
that has come up.

93
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,680
Stopping Arjun
from entering the town

94
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,710
will be unfair to the town.

95
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,690
The town will remain incomplete
without Arjun.

96
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,590
Without Arjun,
my very life is incomplete.

97
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,690
Just for the sake of a vow

98
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,650
I have made my very life,
a penance.

99
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,630
We all have.

100
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,560
That Indraprastha will have
no other wife of you brothers...

101
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,630
It was the vow
that you had taken.

102
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,460
Arjun can't break that vow

103
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,590
and nullify our penance.

104
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,490
If Arjun

105
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,450
wishes to live with
his second wife

106
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,520
he will have to

107
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,430
forsake Indraprastha forever.

108
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,330
If Arjun

109
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,320
wishes to live with
his second wife

110
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,430
he will have to

111
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,560
forsake Indraprastha forever.

112
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,490
But, Panchali

113
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,560
how can the Rajsuya Yajna
be done without Arjun?

114
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,390
How can we ever be independent?

115
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,430
The dream of a great kingdom
will remain unfulfilled.

116
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,560
Does our penance
cause the kingdom

117
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,520
or the desire to have a kingdom
cause our penance?

118
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,460
You have to decide

119
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,520
whether if sweetness
causes sugar to have a value

120
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,290
or if just because it carries
a value

121
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,490
does sugar taste sweet.

122
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,390
If a kingdom is that important

123
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,560
then you all are capable enough

124
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,520
just attack Hastinapur.

125
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,420
It will be unrighteous

126
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,300
but unrighteousness is the cause
of polity in the Aryan empire.

127
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,360
Why should we be any different?

128
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,430
Bear in mind though.

129
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,260
From underneath massive rocks

130
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,290
if a bit of soil is swept away

131
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,450
those rocks tumble down
from their mountains.

132
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,490
A violation of penance
is even easier.

133
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,450
Thus, if Arjun wishes to live

134
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,300
with his second wife

135
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,520
he shall have to forsake
Indraprastha forever!

136
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,320
Prince

137
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,230
won't sister-in-law come
to welcome me?

138
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,160
Subhadra

139
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,230
we might not be able
to even enter the town.

140
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,360
Subhadra, where are you going?

141
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,260
To get you forgiveness.

142
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,120
High Queen

143
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,250
this has been sent
to you

144
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,290
with a request
to keep them safe.

145
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,220
Who sent them?

146
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,130
She says she's a woman
from Dwarka.

147
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,230
This has also been sent by her.

148
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,320
She said
that you can keep it safe.

149
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,060
Tell the High Queen

150
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,220
that it's a request from me
to keep this keepsake safe.

151
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,100
You must be Subhadra.

152
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,250
You must be Subhadra.

153
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,390
Greetings, High Queen.

154
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,450
When I had started from Dwarka

155
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
brother Krishna had given me
these gifts.

156
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,220
All that he had got
from Mathura and Vrindavan.

157
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,450
All those souvenirs.

158
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,290
Brother Krishna had told me

159
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,380
to keep these very safe.

160
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,350
But, High Queen

161
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,310
I feel
I have made a terrible mistake.

162
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,220
I won't be able
to keep them safe.

163
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,250
How would they not be safe?

164
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,420
Your husband is the world's
best archer!

165
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,250
Anything that comes
under his protection

166
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,220
can never be harmed.

167
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,320
I beg your pardon, High Queen

168
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,190
but brother Krishna said
that these are no royal borders

169
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,210
that protection can be given
through weapons.

170
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,320
To keep souvenirs pure
and protected

171
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,210
love and dedication
are required.

172
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,190
Just look at my husband!

173
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,280
He forgot his very vow!

174
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,380
How can he protect
these invaluable souvenirs?

175
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,120
Subhadra!

176
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,160
Arjun is my husband too.

177
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,190
I can't bear to hear
a word in his insult.

178
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,190
The vow that he'd given me

179
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,350
is my concern.

180
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,160
You need not concern yourself
about it.

181
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,280
No, High Queen

182
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,320
I was mentioning about
the vow he had made to me.

183
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,310
He had said that

184
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,380
I'd hold the supreme position
at Indraprastha.

185
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,280
That I'd have power over all.

186
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,110
You wish to become
the High Queen of Indraprastha?

187
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,280
No, High Queen!

188
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,320
A High Queen
has many responsibilities!

189
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,090
She never finds a moment's rest.

190
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,160
I want to have power over
the High Queen of Indraprastha.

191
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,180
And Arjun had said
that it'd surely be so.

192
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Don't speak lies, Subhadra.

193
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,250
I know Arjun.

194
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,190
He can never teach anyone
such a grave ploy.

195
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,210
Surely Govind
has taught you this.

196
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,110
Yes, High Queen.

197
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Brother had said that if I was
to be the cause of your spite

198
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,280
I should have the words
to soothe you as well.

199
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,210
Brother had said

200
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,220
that wherever force
doesn't work

201
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,020
love always conquers.

202
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,180
He had said that if I remain
my simple self

203
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,180
I'd be able to queen over
the High Queen.

204
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,020
That's what brother had said,
High Queen.
