1
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
Who is that fool

2
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,440
who is blocking
the path this way?

3
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,470
Remove your cart!

4
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,240
What is the problem?!

5
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,440
Do you not have the strength
to remove the cart?

6
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,470
Eating a lot has given you
only a big exterior

7
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,470
but no intelligence.

8
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,370
'You 5 brothers will touch
the feet of us 100 brothers.'

9
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,310
'Right now!
And forever after.'

10
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,410
'You need not worry
one bit for Hastinapur.'

11
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,370
'Very soon, the reason
of your worry'

12
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,270
'will come to an end,
brother Bheem.'

13
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,210
'Poisoning all of us first'

14
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,410
'and then torching this place
were all part of a scheme!'

15
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,340
'This way, everyone will think
that we died in an accident.'

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,150
'Duryodhan has schemed
to burn you, our mother!'

17
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,300
Charioteer, remove that fool
and his cart from the path.

18
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,110
Crown Prince, the wheel
of the cart is probably stuck.

19
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,240
All of you are frail and infirm!

20
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,150
You cannot even remove a cart!

21
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
For such a base task

22
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,270
I will have to get down
from the chariot now!

23
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,070
Friend Duryodhan...

24
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,270
Stop, friend.

25
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,340
I shall go help him, friend.

26
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,170
The Crown Prince of Hastinapur

27
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,070
to push a cart in
the city of Kampilya

28
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,150
does not seem correct.

29
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,110
Stop, friend.

30
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,200
Revered 'Brahmin'

31
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,270
it is important for us
to reach the palace promptly.

32
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,240
Let me help you lift the cart.

33
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,110
Allow me, revered 'Brahmin.'

34
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,140
Stop!

35
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,940
You resemble...

36
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,780
You seem familiar.

37
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,670
Who are you?

38
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,740
What is your name?!

39
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,670
I...
- Brother Someshwar!*
*It means "Lord Krishna".

40
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,710
Brother Someshwar.

41
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,870
Friend, you should go back.

42
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,710
I shall remove this right away.

43
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,710
Allow me, revered 'Brahmins.'

44
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,740
Accept our heartfelt gratitude.

45
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,640
Be it a cart or life

46
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,670
when the wheel
gets stuck in the earth

47
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,640
it cannot be lifted
without the aid of someone.

48
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,610
Be it life or a cart

49
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,700
when the weight
exceeds the limits

50
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,740
only then does the wheel
get stuck in the earth.

51
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,570
'Brahmins'

52
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,470
here you go.

53
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,540
Here is some money as charity

54
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,670
from Hastinapur.

55
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,520
Pardon me, Prince.

56
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,460
We earn with labour

57
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,490
and renounce with love.

58
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,690
Neither do we accept charity

59
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
nor engage in it.

60
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,590
Charioteer, proceed!

61
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,460
Had you not come today

62
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,550
he would have certainly
died at my hands.

63
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
But brother Bheem

64
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,550
we have pardoned him.
- No!

65
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,580
I did not pardon him.

66
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,400
I have merely decided
not to punish him.

67
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,430
Then what is the point
in pardoning him, brother Bheem?

68
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,520
When the enemy
is right before you

69
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,420
forgetting the wounds
given by him

70
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
is not that easy.

71
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,460
Even when a mongoose
has been raised on milk

72
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,530
it will still attack a serpent
upon seeing it

73
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,420
because they are arch enemies.

74
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,390
You are correct, brother Bheem.

75
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,490
Let's go now.

76
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,430
But why has he come here?

77
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,320
To take part in the 'swayamvar'
of Princess Draupadi.

78
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,420
Will King Drupad have his
daughter married to him?

79
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,360
It is a 'swayamvar.'

80
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,430
A woman decides
her husband in this.

81
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,390
Who knows

82
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,330
who resides in her heart.

83
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,450
Handmaiden...

84
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,350
Handmaiden.

85
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,300
Where is that painting?
- What painting, Princess?

86
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,460
The one that Malini had brought.

87
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,360
The painting of Prince Arjun.

88
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Go and bring it at once.

89
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,490
Draupadi

90
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,530
why do you require
that painting?

91
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,430
When Prince Arjun will arrive
at the 'swayamvar' tomorrow

92
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,430
you will certainly know.

93
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,490
I too wish to determine, sister

94
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,360
whether I will be able to
recognize Prince Arjun or not.

95
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,220
The truth is,
I wish to determine

96
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,230
whether the person I came across

97
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,360
was Prince Arjun

98
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,450
or not.

99
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,260
What do you mean?

100
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,230
Upon going to
the Shiva temple today

101
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,420
I had a strange encounter,
sister.

102
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
Upon seeing a 'Brahmin'

103
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I felt as though

104
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,230
Lord Shiva was giving me

105
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,430
a sign.

106
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,330
The Almighty can never
give such a sign, Draupadi.

107
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,490
As to who you are to be married

108
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
will be decided at
the 'swayamvar' tomorrow.

109
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,260
And even if the Almighty
had given such a sign

110
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
He would have alluded

111
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,290
to some King or Prince

112
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,300
and not a 'Brahmin,' Draupadi.

113
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,260
Is the Almighty also bound
by the plans of man, sister?

114
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
No

115
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,260
but a Princess is bound
by her oath, Draupadi.

116
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,300
Whoever wins
the 'swayamvar' tomorrow

117
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,230
shall be married to you.

118
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,260
This is your oath.

119
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,390
What if

120
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,290
in the guise of a 'Brahmin'

121
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,390
it was Prince Arjun himself?

122
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,320
What if

123
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,160
upon seeing that painting,
I get the same sign

124
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,160
I had got in the Shiva temple?

125
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,350
Princess

126
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,190
where do we place this painting?

127
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,360
So, Draupadi...

128
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,130
Did you get any sign?

129
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,290
No.

130
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
I did not get any sign.

131
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,360
No one can recognize us
in this disguise, mother.

132
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,200
But had brother Bheem's
anger exceeded its limit today

133
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,190
the whole of Kampilya
would have found out.

134
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,290
This disguise can
camouflage our look

135
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,800
but not our temperament
and disposition.

136
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,190
If our cover is blown,
we will be in deep water, Bheem.

137
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,160
Grandsire will certainly
look for us

138
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,150
and take us back to Hastinapur.

139
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
The situation
we have been dreading

140
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,120
will come into being

141
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
right before our eyes.

142
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,260
We must leave Kampilya
soon, son.

143
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,130
Many Kings will be present
at the'swayamvar.'

144
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,320
Nakul and Sahadev's uncle

145
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,060
the King of Madra,
will recognize them.

146
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,220
And if Krishna and Balaram
are also present there

147
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,300
then they will certainly
recognize Arjun.

148
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,130
But mother

149
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,220
I have heard
people of the city say

150
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,090
that the King of Panchal is
hosting a difficult competition.

151
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,150
A competition that can be won

152
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
only by the best archer
of the world.

153
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,260
In other words

154
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,230
by brother Arjun.

155
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,250
The King of Panchal
must certainly

156
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,250
be awaiting brother Arjun,
mother.

157
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,250
The Arjun who had captured
the King of Panchal

158
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,030
was burnt to ashes
in Varnavrat, Nakul.

159
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,300
No one is awaiting this Arjun.

160
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,000
'As you are going
to the Shiva temple now'

161
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,150
'you should ask
Lord Shiva himself.'

162
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,130
'He is the Lord of Death
and Salvation.'

163
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,260
'That is why, He always
gives a definite answer.'

164
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,990
'If you are to get your answer'

165
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,060
'then you shall get it
