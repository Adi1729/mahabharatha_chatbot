1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,250
You do not have the right
to the Empress just yet.

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,320
For that,
the Empress

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,440
must be won by you in the game.

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,350
I bet my wife

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,470
daughter of the King of Kashi

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,480
Bhanumati in this
round of the game!

7
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,250
Sit down,
servant Yudhishthir.

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,320
You are yet to play
another round

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,270
of the game.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,270
Sit down.

11
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,140
Get up, Your Highness.
Get up.

12
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,250
Defend your honour
while there is still time.

13
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,240
No, Vrushali.

14
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,270
No one can snatch one's honour.

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,340
One can only give it up.

16
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,370
And I can give up my life

17
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,340
but never my honour.

18
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,250
You should go,
Vrushali

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,370
and pray for the protection
of your husband's honour.

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,150
How do I hold on to
the string of control, Govind?

21
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,270
Where are you?

22
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,310
Impossible!

23
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,250
Brother Yudhishthir, you cannot
bet Panchali in the game.

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,270
Brother Yudhishthir

25
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,270
do not let my
premonition come true.

26
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,210
Sit down to play the game,
servant Yudhishthir.

27
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,220
That is an order

28
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,280
of your master,
Emperor Duryodhan.

29
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Sit down.

30
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,210
I cannot bet Panchali
in the game.

31
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,150
Do not tell me now

32
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,240
that a husband does not have
the right to his wife.

33
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,140
If the right to the independence
of your brothers

34
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,140
is something that you have
acknowledged

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,250
then you must also acknowledge
the right you have

36
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,170
to the independence
of your wife.

37
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,120
It is a tradition
of the Aryan region

38
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,150
that a husband

39
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,120
has the right to his wife.

40
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,950
Go on and play,
servant Yudhishthir.

41
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
Bet your wife

42
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,980
in this round of the game!

43
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,950
Do not play,
brother Yudhishthir.

44
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,050
This is not righteous.

45
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,950
Righteousness does reside
in traditions

46
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,210
but not all traditions
are righteous.

47
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,940
Do not play

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,980
otherwise the seed
of a great war will be sown

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,980
in the court
of Hastinapur today.

50
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,020
Brother, if you lose Draupadi
and her honour today

51
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,110
then the hands that roll the dice
in the game will have to burn!

52
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,010
I take the oath

53
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,020
that I shall burn
your hands myself!

54
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,910
I give you the order

55
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,020
to play
servant Yudhishthir!

56
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,110
Play!

57
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,070
He will not be able to play

58
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,050
because he may have
the right to his wife

59
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,020
but it is also essential
to take pride in her.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,110
And how can someone

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
take pride in such a woman?

62
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,020
Duryodhan!

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,070
Duryodhan!

64
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,010
I curse you

65
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,140
that the day you die

66
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,880
you shall pray for death!

67
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,110
Neither will you be able to live

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,070
nor will Lord Yama
give you death!

69
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,840
This curse of yours

70
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,910
does not scare me,
His Excellency.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,070
But this curse shall indeed
yield results, Duryodhan.

72
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,850
Only after pleading for death
seven times will you die!

73
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,940
All that unrighteousness

74
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,070
will assume the form
of pain and suffering

75
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,050
and surround your soul
in your end moments, Duryodhan!

76
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,910
And the Crown Prince is correct.

77
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,850
She is like my sister

78
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,920
because she is the daughter
of my father's friend.

79
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,950
A woman married to five men

80
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,820
and having relationships
with them

81
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,040
is someone I would be
ashamed to call my sister!

82
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,910
Ashwatthama

83
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,910
had you not been my son

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,870
I would have cursed you.

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,750
As a punishment
for uttering such words

86
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,770
I would have cursed you.

87
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,970
May your entire body
get infested with insects.

88
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,910
It shall indeed be so!

89
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,710
The filth of your soul will
appear on your entire body!

90
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,820
The society will abandon you
but Ashwatthama

91
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,910
you will not be able
to abandon your life!

92
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,920
Why would you
give him such a curse?

93
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
If you have such great faith
in righteousness

94
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,950
then go and slay your son.

95
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,780
Before an entire gathering,
when a woman

96
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,880
could insult a warrior
based solely on his caste

97
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,810
and completely negate

98
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
the respect and feelings of
others for her selfishness

99
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,820
how can she be a woman of
exceptional character?

100
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,840
King Karna of Anga

101
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,980
if you take such great pride
in your competence

102
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,680
then how can you utter abuses
like a weak beggar?!

103
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,780
Do remember

104
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,870
that you shall lose all your
competence and knowledge

105
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,810
at the time of your death!

106
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,810
Your soul will be depleted
when you die!

107
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,750
It will be depleted!

108
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,820
The desire to have
a moment of righteousness

109
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,840
will surround you in your
final moments, Maharathi Karna

110
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,810
but despair will
weigh your heart down.

111
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,840
Your entire life

112
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,810
will seem worthless
in your final moments.

113
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,770
Splendid.

114
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,680
Marvellous.

115
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,750
So, it has been proved

116
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,650
that servant Yudhishthir
does have

117
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,680
the right to his wife

118
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,620
but pride

119
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,640
lacks in this case.

120
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,710
I indeed take pride

121
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,620
in Panchali's devotion

122
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,880
in Panchali's sacrifice

123
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
in Panchali's purity!

124
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,610
Apart from Panchali

125
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,580
there is no other devoted wife

126
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,780
who walks this earth
at the moment

127
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,710
King of Gandhar!

128
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
It is said that
at the time of death

129
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,820
every unit of the body

130
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,680
and every particle
fights to live.

131
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,580
Every unit of my body
will fight to win.

132
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,770
I cannot lose Panchali.

133
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,610
Bring new dice

134
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,810
and new pieces.

135
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,780
Only then will I play
the game, Your Highness!

136
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,620
You are a servant now!

137
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,670
An order

138
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
cannot be given by you.

139
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Either obey my order,
brother Duryodhan

140
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,540
or sentence me to death
this instant!

141
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,640
'These dice'

142
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,550
'are made from the bones
of my late father.'

143
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,570
'They obey every word of mine.'

144
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,640
Dusshasan

145
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,680
bring new pieces.

146
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,510
Uncle, your magical dice
have been broken!

147
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,570
Take these pieces away

148
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,580
and bring new dice.

149
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,540
The generosity to accept
the request of a servant

150
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,640
does reside in me.

151
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,380
Go on.

152
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,340
There you go,
servant Yudhishthir.

153
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,450
The new pieces
and new dice are here.

154
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,400
Play...

155
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,540
Against the wife
of Emperor Duryodhan

156
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,350
Lady Bhanumati

157
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,320
you need to bet your wife

158
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,580
Draupadi in the game.

159
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,440
Sit down and play,
servant!

160
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,220
Sit down and play,
servant!

161
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Go on and play,
servant!

162
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,080
Go on,
dice.

163
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,930
Twelve.

164
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,930
May servant Yudhishthir
have happiness!

165
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,830
Your wife Draupadi has been

166
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,830
