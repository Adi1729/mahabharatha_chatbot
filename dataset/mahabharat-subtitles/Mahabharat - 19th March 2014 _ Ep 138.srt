1
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,900
I can accept your proposal,
King Shakuni.

2
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,990
But there's only
one problem.

3
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,960
The great warrior

4
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,990
Karna.

5
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,730
Such a great warrior
cannot be left independent.

6
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,000
Me?
- Yes.

7
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,770
I don't belong to
the warrior class, Emperor.

8
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,730
I'm a charioteer.

9
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,990
I am no king.

10
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,730
Charioteer or warrior...
It makes no difference to me.

11
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,770
You are devoted to your friend

12
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,930
and not towards me.

13
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,990
The mightiest emperor
is the one

14
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,900
to whom even skilled warriors
surrender their arms.

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,870
I hand over a kingdom Malini* to you.
*Malinipuri.

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,900
You will be its king.

17
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,830
And will swear allegiance
to me.

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,870
Any plant that is going to
yield sweet fruits in future

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,730
is to be planted
in my orchard.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,700
And not in

21
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
anyone else's orchard.

22
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,700
I apologise, Emperor.

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,890
I do not wish
to take up

24
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,870
the responsibility
of a kingdom.

25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,760
I have returned
an acquired kingdom.

26
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,660
Maybe King Shakuni

27
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,760
compelled you to
renounce the kingdom.

28
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,790
So that a skilled warrior
remains independent

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,670
and carry out his orders

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,670
and not mine.

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,860
Great warrior Karna

32
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,600
I am a wrestler.
A wrestler!

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
Not a moron.

34
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,760
You will surrender
as a king

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,700
and only then can this plan
be successful.

36
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,690
Friend

37
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,620
there is a very complex
situation in front of us.

38
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,730
What do we do now?

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,800
I request to you,
friend.

40
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,740
Don't ask me
for anything

41
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,760
that becomes a burden
for me.

42
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,560
My child

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,730
It's important
to stop Karna.

44
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,590
I am afraid

45
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,600
Vasudev Krishna

46
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,660
is on his way

47
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,630
to Magadh

48
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,730
with the intention
to attack.

49
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,530
At that time

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,690
Karna protecting you,
will not be enough.

51
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,530
He has to be there to protect

52
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,540
Emperor Jarasandh.

53
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,730
Or else

54
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,500
the entire plan

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,500
will be down the drain.

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,660
But, uncle

57
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,530
how do I persuade him?

58
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,470
Go tell him

59
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,500
that the ones who go
to the ocean

60
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,540
in search of a pearl

61
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,630
keep themselves

62
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,540
tied to the boat.

63
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,660
Now that you are in a pact with
an unrighteous emperor

64
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,660
like Jarasandh

65
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,570
then it is necessary

66
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,660
that he keeps you

67
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,560
tied to righteousness.

68
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,630
Or else

69
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,670
you will drown

70
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,700
in the ocean of unrighteousness.

71
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,430
You have done me many a favour,
friend.

72
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,430
If I'm able to repay
them in this life

73
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,600
I will be satiated.

74
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,460
I will not be able to take
any more of this burden.

75
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,400
Don't say that, Karna.

76
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,470
I have not done you
any favour.

77
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,400
Whatever you got was
the result of

78
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,630
your capability
and knowledge.

79
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,600
You considering me
your friend

80
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,360
makes me feel honoured.

81
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,400
Friend...
- Let me complete, friend.

82
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,620
The other day,
out of anger

83
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,540
I had called you
a charioteer.

84
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,470
I am a charioteer, friend.

85
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm the son
of a charioteer.

86
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,440
And Vrushali explained
to me

87
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,560
that if I continue to see my
birth as an embarrassment

88
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,490
then I will never be
happy in life.

89
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
You addressed me
as a charioteer's son.

90
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,370
I hold no anger for that.
- You may not.

91
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,470
But I'm angry
with myself.

92
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,490
Do you know why, Karna?

93
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
Do you know why
I am angry with myself?

94
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,470
Because I know what
righteousness is.

95
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,430
But I'm unable to walk the
path of righteousness, friend.

96
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,490
I end up insulting
my friend.

97
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,370
I end up committing
a lot of unrighteous deeds.

98
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,400
You stop me,
yet I commit.

99
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,470
The sins I commit

100
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,300
are like a crack
in the wall

101
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,500
that keeps deepening
by the day.

102
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,330
Your path maybe
impure, friend

103
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,300
but your intentions
are not.

104
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,430
You are fighting
against injustice.

105
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,530
Do you know, friend?

106
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,430
You know, the day
I'm able to resolve injustice

107
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,390
I'll be able to walk the path
of righteousness.

108
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,390
Do you have faith,
my friend?

109
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,320
I have complete faith.

110
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,400
But if uncle's plan
fails to succeed today

111
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,430
then it will never succeed.

112
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,320
This crack of
unrighteousness

113
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
will tear my life apart,
friend.

114
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
I require your support,
friend.

115
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,430
Yes.

116
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,360
Yes, I'm being selfish.

117
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,330
But won't you stand
by me today?

118
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,270
Unrighteousness can
be eradicated, friend

119
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,340
but only with the help
of your faith.

120
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,290
Will you support me?

121
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,230
'Regardless of if a horse
is pulling a chariot or not'

122
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,170
'but till he dons a bridle'

123
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,330
'he cannot be considered free.'

124
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,200
'Get lost, charioteer!
Listen to your father'

125
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,360
'for he is aware that
a charioteer is incompetent.'

126
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,360
'Go away, charioteer!
Go away.'

127
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,300
'Go away, charioteer!'

128
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,130
'If this young archer
is a king'

129
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,230
'the he can challenge Arjun.'

130
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,330
'I'

131
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
'Emperor of the Kuru lineage,
Dhritarashtra'

132
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,340
'right away, declare
this young boy'

133
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,200
'the king of Anga.'

134
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,170
'The entire Hastinapur's army is
there to protect your friend.'

135
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,290
'But only you can protect
me and my harmony, lord.'

136
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,060
'Prince, I accept to
bear the king's orders'

137
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,360
'and at the king's feet
I vow'

138
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,290
'that hereafter'

139
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,220
'my property'

140
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,060
'and even my life'

141
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
'will forever be at your
feet, Prince.'

142
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,290
'If needed'

143
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,100
'you can wear the crown
once again.'

144
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,280
I accept

145
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,220
your orders, Prince.

146
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,190
What happened, Madhav?

147
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,310
Why did you stop?

148
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
King Shakuni.

149
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,090
There isn't another man as
intelligent as King Shakuni

150
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,250
in the entire Arya dynasty,
Parth.

151
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,160
But unfortunately, he uses
his intelligence

152
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,220
for his selfish purpose

153
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,150
and not for benevolence.

154
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,190
What do you mean?
I didn't get you.

155
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,280
Circumstances have
changed, Parth.

156
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,280
Now, we will not be able to
gain victory over Magadh.

157
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
What do you mean?

158
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,210
Won't we kill Jarasandh,
Vasudev?

159
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,150
Now that depends on you,
Bheem.

160
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,310
I have heard that
as a child

161
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,190
that you had learnt to wrestle
from Magadh's wrestlers.

162
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,020
Do you remember
any techniques?

163
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,120
Definitely.
A lot of them.

164
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,090
Then the death of Jarasandh
is definite, Bheem.

165
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,240
But now

166
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,280
the princes of Indraprastha
cannot enter Magadh.

167
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,250
A Brahmin wrestler

168
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,180
will now have to
enter Magadh.

169
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,180
Oh, Lord Bhairav!*
*"Terrible" or "Frightful", sometimes known as Kala Bhairava, is the fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.

170
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Oh, Lord Mahakaal!*
*The Destroyer of one who destroys.

171
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,050
Please accept the sacrifice
of 100 rulers.

172
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,180
May I be blessed with
the life and the power

173
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,950
of these kings.

174
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,990
Get those

175
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,080
disciples of Krishna!

176
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,150
In the place meant
for the Rajsuya Yajna

177
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,180
why is he planning to carry
out a sacrifice?

178
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,210
If he wants to
kill those kings

179
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,090
then why doesn't he
kill all of them at once?

180
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,180
My child

181
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,990
sacrificing men is considered
very pious at Magadh.

182
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,920
And that is why Jarasandh
is considered a sinner

183
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,150
by the entire Arya dynasty.

184
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,190
Uncle!

185
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,090
I have an extraordinary news.

186
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,120
The Pandavas were approaching
Magadh with their army.

187
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,050
Suddenly they changed
their path.

188
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,090
The army changed
its path!

189
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,050
Surprising!

190
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,020
They must have
gotten scared.

191
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,120
My child, if a leaf flying with
the winds changes its path

192
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,050
it can be considered abrupt.

193
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,980
But

194
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,960
if a bird

195
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,920
changes its path

196
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,150
it is considered
a strategy.

197
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,990
I'm unable
to understand

198
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,990
what Vasudev Krishna

199
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,110
has as a strategy.

200
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,630
Hail King Jarasandh!

201
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,340
Hail King Jarasandh!

202
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,370
Hail King Jarasandh!

203
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,370
Hail King Jarasandh!

204
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,370
Hail King Jarasandh!

205
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,430
Madhav

206
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,470
we've to stop the kings
from being sacrificed.

207
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,340
That's very simple, Parth.

208
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,330
Jarasandh

209
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,340
cannot ignore a challenge
to wrestle.

210
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,340
That forms the core
of his maxims.

211
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,400
Emperor Jarasandh

212
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,330
an animal sacrificed
during a yajna

213
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,340
is first fed well.

214
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,570
Only the sacrifice which
is completely satiated

215
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,300
adds to one's merit.

216
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,370
Won't you give
your sacrifices

217
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,270
an opportunity to
feel contentment

218
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,370
before their death?

219
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,330
Nothing can give contentment
to a person

220
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,530
who is about to die.
- That's untrue, Emperor.

221
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,270
For the worshippers
of bravery

222
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,390
to witness your art
of wrestling

223
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,430
is the biggest reason
of contentment

224
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,360
and that's what I have heard.

225
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,430
This friend of mine

226
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,270
Vrikodar

227
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,470
challenges you for
a wrestling match.

228
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,270
I don't have the time now.

229
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,240
The auspicious moment for the
sacrifice is at hand, Brahmins!

230
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,410
You denied the challenge
of wrestling?

231
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,230
Friend, it's a very happy
moment for us.

232
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,330
We won!

233
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,370
Now you can tell all the
wrestlers of the Arya dynasty

234
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,470
that Emperor Jarasandh

235
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,390
did not accept
your challenge.

236
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,430
This is a very happy moment.

237
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,240
Let's go.

238
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,440
Stop!

239
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,430
First try to displace my leg.

240
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,260
Then you can dare
to challenge me.

241
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,300
Which leg, Emperor?

242
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,340
Don't be too proud.

243
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,430
Any of them.

244
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,200
I have come to Magadha
to displace both your legs.

245
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,130
Who are you?

246
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,090
After having consumed
the food

247
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,200
you don't question about
the cook's caste

248
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,260
Emperor Jarasandh.

249
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,240
You have accepted
the challenge.

250
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,230
Now you'll have
to wrestle.

251
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,170
Vasudev Krishna!

252
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,270
Greetings.

253
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,210
Pandu's son Bheem

254
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,270
is very excited

255
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,100
to have a wrestling
match with you.
