1
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:51,699
Who?

2
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,868
Who dared to help me
when I did not ask for any?

3
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,741
It is me, brother.

4
00:04:58,813 --> 00:04:59,837
Pandu.

5
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,818
I do not require your help!

6
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:10,757
I do not fear anyone.

7
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,760
Do not keep reminding me

8
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,859
that I am blind.

9
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,986
In this world,
each person has some weakness

10
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,990
or the other.

11
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:52,962
For instance,
someone cannot run very fast

12
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,930
while another,
cannot lift heavy weights.

13
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,897
While one is afflicted
with a malignant disease

14
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,876
another is unable to recall
the things he has learnt.

15
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:04,938
There are many such examples.

16
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:09,842
Do you know a person

17
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:12,953
who has everything?

18
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,982
And that single weakness of ours

19
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:20,885
is considered the epicenter
of our lives.

20
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:25,994
This gives birth to sadness
and discontentment in the heart.

21
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,994
Weakness is either
a congenital defect

22
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:30,863
or is bestowed by fate

23
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,996
but the same weakness,
by the nous of a person

24
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:36,002
is assumed to be the bounds
not to be overstepped.

25
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,914
But there are some people

26
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,917
who, through their
righteousness and hard work

27
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:45,911
defeat their weakness.

28
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:49,888
What is the difference between
such people and others?

29
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:52,953
Have you ever thought about it?

30
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:56,889
There is a very simple answer
to it.

31
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,732
A person who does not
let his weakness defeat him

32
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,829
and houses righteousness
in his heart

33
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,764
is able to move
past his weakness.

34
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,810
In other words,
God may give one weakness

35
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,004
but bounds..

36
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:15,916
Bounds are determined
only by the nous of a person.

37
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:18,776
Think about it.

38
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:46,837
Pandu

39
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,739
you are here.

40
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:52,919
Are you here to help
your elder brother again

41
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,017
so that no one is able
to forget that I am blind?

42
00:07:58,926 --> 00:07:59,984
Am I right?

43
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,870
A king is offered services,
brother

44
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,832
and not aided.
- But I am

45
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:15,798
not yet a king.

46
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:19,902
But you are the heir to the
throne of Hastinapur, brother.

47
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:22,943
The throne has been awaiting
your presence all these years.

48
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,883
A throne is not meant for a king

49
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:28,879
but a king is meant for it.

50
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,967
Greetings,
brother Dhritarashtra.

51
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:49,932
Greetings.

52
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,974
And the heir to the throne

53
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:57,941
is decided by the capability
of a person, brother Pandu.

54
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,768
I am the eldest of this dynasty.

55
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:17,963
I have immense strength.

56
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,901
I can fire projectiles
guided by sound.

57
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:28,806
I am skilled with
every weapon.

58
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,809
I have complete knowledge
of all the 'Shastras' and lores.

59
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,789
Then who are you to judge
my competence?

60
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:39,951
I cannot that,
brother Dhritarashtra.

61
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:43,763
Only the Chief Minister
has the right to do so.

62
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,891
When the time is right,
he will take the decision.

63
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:49,759
All I was telling brother Pandu

64
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:53,838
that words spoken out of time

65
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,967
are worthless like the fruits
picked before they turn ripe.

66
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,845
Allow me to take your leave,
brother Dhritarashtra.

67
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:01,904
Goodbye.

68
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:04,978
Goodbye, brother Pandu.

69
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,062
This is the reason..

70
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,132
This is the reason why
he is envious of us, Pandu

71
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,945
because we are the sons
of King Vichitravirya

72
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,003
but he

73
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,050
is the son of a maid!

74
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,180
Son of a maid.

75
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,955
No, brother.

76
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,961
Do not be so hard-hearted.

77
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,030
The three of us
have the same father

78
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:13,004
and Vidur is also like family
to grandfather and Queen Mother.

79
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,102
Neither does anyone ever doubt
the depth of his knowledge

80
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:21,170
nor can his devotion towards
Hastinapur be questioned.

81
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,050
And grandfather adores
a particular virtue of his

82
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,112
that he does not sugar coat
the truth while saying it.

83
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,123
Do not call it a virtue
but vice, Pandu.

84
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,927
Anything said to insult a person

85
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,964
is not candidness but an abuse.

86
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,125
An abuse.

87
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,941
But, brother, the truth
insults only that person

88
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,100
who harbours any
false intentions.

89
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,078
You have nothing but
righteousness in your heart.

90
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,073
Then why would you get insulted?

91
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,110
You should always be gleeful,
brother

92
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,987
because a melancholic heart
can never dispense justice

93
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,013
and it is the duty of a king
to uphold justice.

94
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,123
Being gleeful?

95
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:21,003
I shall be gleeful only after
I am enthroned as king, Pandu.

96
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,175
I am always skeptical, right?

97
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,916
I have always been doubtful
of my next step.

98
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:39,123
With every sound I hear,
I am filled with disbelief.

99
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,892
I keep looking
for some hidden meaning

100
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,954
in every word I hear, Pandu.

101
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,931
All my life..

102
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:54,096
All my life, I have believed
in nothing but disbelief, Pandu.

103
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,037
This disbelief gives birth

104
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,975
to loneliness

105
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:07,185
and this loneliness will end

106
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,157
only when I am
enthroned as king.

107
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,959
No one will be able
to make a sound near me

108
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,053
without my permission

109
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:24,062
when I shall be declared
as King Dhritarashtra!

110
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,003
Only then..
- All hail the king!

111
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,940
All hail the king!

112
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,956
A kingdom is for the service
of its subjects, brother

113
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,927
and it cannot be run
for a selfish cause.

114
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,090
Besides, loneliness is cured
not by owning a kingdom

115
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,928
but by embracing love.

116
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,127
You need a wife now, brother

117
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,131
who will become your eyes

118
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,203
to rid you of your loneliness.

119
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:13,017
I do not have the time
to think about marriage, Pandu.

120
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,989
You need not think about it.

121
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,059
Grandfather and Queen Mother
have already thought about it.

122
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,124
By fixing your marriage
with the princess of Gandhar.

123
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,929
I know.

124
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,937
I have heard
that the princess of Gandhar

125
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,040
is unparalleled in beauty
and virtues, brother.

126
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,109
And she has also been
blessed by Lord Shiva

127
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,111
to beget a 100 sons.

128
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,174
You are extremely fortunate,
brother.

129
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,917
The princess of Gandhar
is the fortunate one, Pandu

130
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:52,989
who is destined to become
the queen of Hastinapur.

131
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,181
My King

132
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,187
after taking a decision

133
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:15,061
weakening the heart
by means of pain and worry

134
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,191
is but worthless.

135
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,935
I am not worried or sad,
Sudharma.

136
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,976
My heart is burdened
with the feeling of guilt.

137
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,172
I feel as though l have
a great load on my heart.

138
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:38,113
My King, when you accepted
the proposal of Bhishma

139
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,080
I was filled with anger

140
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,149
but after pondering over it

141
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,028
I feel

142
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,031
that your decision was correct.

143
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,161
With a person like Bhishma
and the army of Hastinapur

144
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,937
waging a war against them would
spell disaster for our subjects.

145
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,202
This decision was made
by a king, Sudharma

146
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:08,950
but a father still considers
this decision to be wrong.

147
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:13,143
My King

148
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,091
a father is bound by affection

149
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,028
and affection makes one weak.

150
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,897
Sudharma

151
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,062
look at our daughter
in the garden.

152
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,901
She is frolicking there.

153
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:39,113
Like a bird that knits its
dreams on the tree of happiness

154
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:45,052
she has no idea that the tree
is about to be chopped down.

155
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,986
She is a princess, my King.

156
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,996
If she has to make a sacrifice
for the sake of her subjects

157
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,963
then she will do so
with a smile on her face.

158
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:06,039
But how will I tell my daughter
about this, Sudharma?

159
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:10,111
That for the sake of happiness
of the subjects of Gandhar

160
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:14,148
I have given her sadness
for her entire life.

161
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,984
Not now, my King.

162
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,945
Right now, Gandhari is in

163
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:23,982
a state of bliss

164
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,095
and I cannot see

165
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,997
this bliss
transform into misery.

166
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:40,007
Let her fate reveal itself
before her.

167
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,156
But when Shakuni returns
from the hunt

168
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,954
what will happen then, Sudharma?

169
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,158
He is very fond of his sister.

170
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,160
He will never accept the fact
that his sister is being married

171
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,129
to a blind person.

172
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:35,121
Make haste, sire.

173
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,020
The rope is breaking.

174
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:50,102
Prince, this rope will break.

175
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,977
It cannot take the weight
of two people.

176
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:08,963
Then I shall let go
of the rope, soldier.

177
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,998
That will save your life.
- No, Prince. No.

178
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,969
Your life is more precious
than mine.

179
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,165
Then you should
let go of the rope.

180
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,009
Let go.
- No.. No..

181
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,111
Let go.

182
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,143
Let go!
