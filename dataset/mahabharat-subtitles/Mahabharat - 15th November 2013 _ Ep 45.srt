1
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,420
'I'll give you whatever
you desire.'

2
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,230
'Till I don't give
you the guru-donation'

3
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,330
'I will not use the skills
I derived from you.'

4
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,200
'As a guru-donation'

5
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,360
'you will give me
the thumb of your right hand.'

6
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,290
Here, I have brought
a gift for you.

7
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,260
Just check.
You will be very pleased.

8
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,300
Are you happy?
Is your soul at peace

9
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,230
having an innocent's
thumb chopped off?

10
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,290
What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

11
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,290
Go and ask the master

12
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,220
who to make you an expert archer

13
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,300
asked Ekalavya for his
thumb as an offering.

14
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,260
So that better archers than you
can't even fire arrows now.

15
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,100
What are you saying,
brother Duryodhan?

16
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,190
You should be ashamed of making
allegations at the master.

17
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,200
You should be the one
to be ashamed.

18
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,200
To prove your superiority

19
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
you make one suffer thus?

20
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,070
Has your recluse of a father
taught you such strategies?

21
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,220
Take a look at
the chopped thumb.

22
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,230
Someone's dreams
lie destroyed.

23
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,150
His future has been chopped off

24
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,060
just because of you!

25
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,100
Along with that your
righteousness

26
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
and your respect has been
laid to waste too.

27
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,260
Arjun, dew drops can't
fill up a reservoir.

28
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,260
Superiority attained in
charity has no value.

29
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,120
Had I been in your stead

30
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,170
I would have taken an oath
to never touch the bow.

31
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,020
Right now!

32
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,960
You can ask me anything.

33
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,190
Aren't you confident
about me, master?

34
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,060
Can't I become the best
archer through practice?

35
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,170
What concerns me is how much
you believe in your master.

36
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,090
Have you assumed that
to make you superior

37
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,100
I am being impartial to my
other students?

38
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,160
The clouds shower more
rains on the forests

39
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,220
and less on the deserts.

40
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,990
But a master's knowledge
is never biased.

41
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,130
So the master is termed
superior to the clouds.

42
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,030
Then why such an offering
from Ekalavya?

43
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,190
What offering should a master
ask from his students

44
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,930
can be rightfully decided
only by a master.

45
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,890
But, master, why ask for an
offering which is a disgrace?

46
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,900
I know

47
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,900
that the sons of Dhritarashtra
would accuse me of being biased.

48
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,130
Not only them

49
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,970
the future generations would
also accuse me of being biased.

50
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,960
Arjun, I was helpless
before my duty.

51
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,060
Ekalavya would have used my
knowledge for Magadha

52
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,160
which is an enemy of
the Kuru dynasty.

53
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,020
Can the boundaries of a kingdom
control knowledge, master?

54
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,930
No.

55
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,990
But the master delivering
the knowledge

56
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,070
is bounded by his oath
and his promises.

57
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,030
My mouth eats the grains
given by the Kuru kingdom.

58
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,870
So my loyalty is only towards
the throne of Hastinapur.

59
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,030
Had Ekalavya attained knowledge
from another master

60
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,930
and become a better
archer than you

61
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,990
I would have been pleased.

62
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,860
But...

63
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,920
But the allegations
made on you...

64
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,060
How would they
be cleared, master?

65
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,990
There is one solution, dear.

66
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,860
You should prove undisputedly
that you are the best.

67
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,990
Why just Ekalavya?

68
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,060
Even Bhishma can't be
a better archer than you.

69
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,760
Prove it, dear.
Prove it.

70
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,860
If you do that

71
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,900
I will get rid of
the allegations.

72
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,790
Ashwatthama, my friend.

73
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,730
We are here to seek
your permission.

74
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,760
Permission?

75
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,700
We, the sons of Dhritarashtra,
are leaving the seminary.

76
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,820
We were fortunate to find a
friend like you at the seminary.

77
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
But we are sure

78
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,860
we will not attain anything
more than this here.

79
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,890
Moreover

80
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,820
can you attain anything
when Arjun is here?

81
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,660
I have my doubts on that.

82
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,790
What is the matter son?
You look a bit ill.

83
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,750
Father, I want the weapon
created by Brahma.

84
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,660
Today.

85
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,690
Lord Brahma's weapon?

86
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,700
Son, to attain the weapon, you
have to prove your credentials.

87
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,690
Isn't being your son
enough?

88
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,850
Before you give Brahma's
weapon to Arjun

89
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,860
I want it, father.

90
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,890
Son, I haven't taught Arjun
about Brahma's weapon yet.

91
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,850
You are already teaching
him the mantras.

92
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,790
Why are you so partial to Arjun?

93
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,690
Thanks to the partiality

94
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,630
the sons of Dhritarashtra are
quitting the seminary today.

95
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,600
Due to the partiality,
the seminary will be shut soon.

96
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,860
Your son is displeased
with the partiality.

97
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,750
If water stored
in a pot smells foul

98
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,760
then surely someone has
dirtied it.

99
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
If you are displeased,
I am sure

100
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
you are being supported
by ineligible people.

101
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,790
But still

102
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,630
I have to clear the doubts in
the minds of your friends.

103
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,830
Because I can never see you
hurt and displeased ever.

104
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,560
Never.

105
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,730
Go tell the sons of
Dhritarashtra

106
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,520
Dronacharya will
take a bath in the river

107
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,550
and take an oath to
be unbiased.

108
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,720
Everyone should assemble
at the river bank.

109
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,490
Father! - Master!
- Master!

110
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,490
Master!

111
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,590
Master!

112
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Master!
- Dushashan!

113
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,420
Go bring my weapon Dushashan!

114
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,380
So?

115
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,250
Do all of you wish to
quit the seminary?

116
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,220
You can surely go.

117
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,250
You have my permissions.

118
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,480
But remember

119
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,220
to collect more water
from a stream

120
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,350
one needs a bigger vessel.

121
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,220
And to attain more knowledge
from a master

122
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,350
one needs to have
a broader mind.

123
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,250
A fertile mind is attained
only with dedication.

124
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,380
If you leave from here today

125
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,450
you will surely be very
less eligible.

126
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
And if you stay back

127
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,410
it is possible

128
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,290
that you may develop a
better mind to learn more.

129
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,190
The decision is up to you.

130
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,250
Arjun is the best student
of the seminary.

131
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,160
So he will become
the best archer of the world.

132
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,280
All the students attaining
knowledge from a master

133
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,250
do not attain the same
kind of knowledge.

134
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,250
All students are seen
listening to the master

135
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,260
they are seen worshipping him

136
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,160
but can't attain the same
kind of knowledge.

137
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,280
Have you ever thought as to why
does that happen?

138
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,280
The truth is

139
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,360
that the students who do
not attain knowledge

140
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,280
try to exhibit dedication

141
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,350
but they do not understand
the real meaning of dedication.

142
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,110
By offering flowers on
a master's feet

143
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,350
or by following the
master's orders

144
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,180
is dedication
actually proven?

145
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,320
No.

146
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,090
Dedication
is achieved indeed when

147
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,060
one has no doubts about
the master.

148
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,350
A student should finish the task
even before a master instructs.

149
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,090
A student and a
master should think alike.

150
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,120
Until a student doesn't

151
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,110
see the forms of Lord Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh*
*One of the many names of Shiva.

152
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,150
within their master

153
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,280
until then his dedication
isn't true.

154
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,210
In reality, dedication
isn't a task.

155
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,320
Dedication is the feeling
of our heart

156
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
and a state of mind.

157
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,150
In other words...

158
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,110
Isn't our ignorance

159
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,110
only because our mind
is at fault?

160
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,080
Think about it.
