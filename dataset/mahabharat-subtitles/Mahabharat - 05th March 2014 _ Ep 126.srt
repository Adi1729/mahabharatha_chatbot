1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,370
The architecture of the Gods,
Vishwakarma, himself

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,310
is helping the sons of Pandu

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,340
by building the city of
Indraprastha for them, brother.

4
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,400
In other words

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,240
to aid them in the
reverence of the city

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,280
it is time now to send them
one lakh cows.

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,270
Why do I hear a tone of doubt
in your voice, Minister?

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,300
Do you think I do not remember
my promises, Vidur?!

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,240
I do not doubt you,
brother Dhritarashtra.

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,210
It is easy to give charity
to the impoverished

11
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,400
but when being charitable
to the affluent

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,400
envy is born in the process.

13
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,340
I am alluding

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,310
to Prince Duryodhan,
Your Highness.

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,330
Minister!

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,300
The Crown Prince
is a gallant warrior

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,310
oh righteous one

18
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,440
Minister Vidur.

19
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,370
The Crown Prince will not break
his promise, Your Excellency.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,180
But

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,110
why give away
one lakh cows, Minister?

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,140
Why do we not send
all the cows of Hastinapur

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,140
to Indraprastha?

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,270
Why do we not send them
all the gold coins

25
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,370
with your permission?

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,270
Why are you are being sarcastic,
King of Gandhar?

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,370
I am not being sarcastic,
oh intelligent one.

28
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,350
I am not being sarcastic.

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,270
The true property of a kingdom

30
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,140
is not represented by
either cows or gold coins.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,140
The true property of a kingdom

32
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,270
is its subjects.

33
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,070
Beloved Duryodhan knows that.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,110
But the thing is...

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,240
Out of his property,
my nephew

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,180
will give away
one lakh gold coins

37
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,110
and even one lakh cows.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,110
If he exhausts his fortune

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,080
by helping the Pandavas
in becoming prosperous

40
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,110
then

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,300
how will he

42
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,140
gain all this wealth again?

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,140
Even today,
the subjects of Hastinapur

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,300
go to great pains

45
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,080
to make the kingdom prosperous,
King of Gandhar.

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,110
And they will continue to do so.

47
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,170
In other words

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,300
the subjects of Hastinapur

49
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,140
who wish to migrate
to the city of the Pandavas

50
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,110
should not be
permitted to do so?

51
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,210
This is

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,110
all I wanted to know, Vidur.

53
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,130
What do you mean?

54
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,230
Your Highness

55
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,200
a new city is being built there.

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,200
Many people
are leaving Hastinapur

57
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,150
and migrating to Indraprastha.

58
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,240
I fear, Your Highness

59
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,170
that if majority of the subjects

60
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,080
migrate to Indraprastha

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,210
then Hastinapur will never be

62
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,040
able to become prosperous again.

63
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,080
If that happens

64
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,180
then what will the Minister do?

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,050
A mahout* uses love to control an elephant, King of Gandhar.
*A mahout/mahamatra  is a person who rides an elephant.

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,230
And that is why

67
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,010
the elephant never
forsakes the mahout.

68
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,200
Duryodhan must also

69
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,950
employ love
to control the subjects.

70
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,940
Certainly,
Your Excellency.

71
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,130
Certainly.

72
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,240
But before one learns
to control it with love

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the elephant

74
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,080
is captured quite cruelly.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,050
You seem to be forgetting this,
Your Excellency.

76
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,100
The subjects of Hastinapur

77
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,970
cannot be allowed
to leave the city.

78
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,910
This is what I feel,
Your Highness.

79
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,040
You are correct,
Shakuni.

80
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,040
Minister!
- Your Highness.

81
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,910
You need to make
an announcement.

82
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,110
No subject of Hastinapur
can leave the city

83
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,170
and migrate to Indraprastha.

84
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,980
Any person who
disobeys this order

85
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,010
shall be imprisoned
and punished.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,030
But dear...

87
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,930
Uncle

88
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,880
this order shall be executed

89
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,080
personally by you,

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
I hope you have
no problem, uncle.

91
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,950
It is my duty,
Your Highness.

92
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,880
Your Highness, why use
a sword to kill an ant?

93
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,910
His Excellency Bhishma

94
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,950
need not be bothered for this.

95
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,840
If you allow me

96
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,000
then in order to stop
the subjects from leaving

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,910
I can send King Karna of Anga.

98
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,840
Then ask the King of Anga

99
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,050
to close the gates
of the city of Hastinapur.

100
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,780
And to allow no subject
of Hastinapur

101
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,900
to leave the city.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As you say,
Your Highness.

103
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,840
Your Excellency.

104
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,740
Close the gates of the city!

105
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,780
The gates are closing!
- Make haste!

106
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,750
We must leave post-haste!
- Open the gates!

107
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,710
The gates are closing!
- Make haste. - Open the gates!

108
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,840
Make haste!

109
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,810
Let's go.
- They are closing the gates!

110
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,840
The gates are closing!
- Let's go! - Open the gates!

111
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,880
Open the gates! - Make haste!
- King of Anga

112
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,900
order the soldiers

113
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,770
to arrest all the subjects.

114
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,710
Open the gates!
- My entire family...

115
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,710
My Lord, where are you?
My Lord...

116
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,680
My Lord,
I am still on this side.

117
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,930
My Lord...

118
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,800
The subjects are leaving
the city, King of Anga.

119
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,730
Have the gates of the city
closed, King of Anga!

120
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,810
You need to be stern with them!
What are you thinking?!

121
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,940
Father...
Father!

122
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,900
Father!

123
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,710
My son is still inside!

124
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,740
King of Anga... - Be quiet,
Prince Dusshasan!

125
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,770
While closing the gates
of the city

126
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,640
one cannot close
the gates of one's heart.

127
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,680
I have accepted this duty

128
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,810
and I shall decide
how to carry it out.

129
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,930
Let's go.

130
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,610
Father...

131
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Father!

132
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,610
Father!

133
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,810
Father...

134
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,710
Open the gates!

135
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,780
Open the gates!
- Open them!

136
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,670
Calm down!
- Open them!

137
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,800
Please calm down!
- Let us go!

138
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,550
Please calm down.
- Please do not do this!

139
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,810
No one is allowed
to leave the city.

140
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,680
King Dhritarashtra
has given the order

141
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,580
that if anyone tries
to leave the city by force

142
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,840
then he shall be imprisoned!

143
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,830
Open the gates...

144
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,670
I request all of you.
Please...

145
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,770
Please return to your homes.

146
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,770
Return to your homes, please!

147
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,810
Our entire family
is outside the city!

148
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,600
Let us go!
- Open the gates!

149
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,730
That is impossible.

150
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,770
The gates of the city
cannot be opened.

151
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,540
The people who are outside
will be imprisoned and punished.

152
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,770
Open them...
- Open the gates!

153
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,570
All of you need to
return to your homes.

154
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,570
Let us go!
- Open the gates!

155
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,670
Open the gates!
- Radheya!

156
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,580
We have to go outside!

157
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,300
Vrushali!

158
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Are you leaving
the city as well?

159
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,320
I had left with father
the first time

160
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,130
but fate brought me here again.

161
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,030
My father is outside the city

162
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,190
and he is alive.

163
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,160
Please let me go to him.

164
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,160
Just like me, the families
of these people

165
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,290
are also outside the city gates.

166
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,160
Why has His Highness given
an order to separate families?

167
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,330
No one can leave
one's kingdom, Vrushali.

168
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,190
But if we find happiness there

169
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,120
then why can we not?

170
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,990
Do not argue with me,
Vrushali.

171
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,290
Learn to accept
what you get here as joy.

172
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
There was a time

173
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,170
when, instead of accepting
the joy you had

174
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,100
searching for happiness
and seeking joy

175
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,220
was what you
believed in, Radheya.

176
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,120
Pardon me

177
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,220
King Karna.

178
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,990
But maybe

179
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,130
the head a crown adorns

180
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,020
seems to bring about a change
in its way of thinking.

181
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,070
My father was correct

182
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,960
that unrighteousness
resides not in a man

183
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,130
but in his crown.

184
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,030
Pardon me,
King of Anga

185
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,030
but I must open these gates
and go to the other side.

186
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,190
Vrushali, stop.

187
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,930
King of Anga

188
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,930
if you let this maiden go

189
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,000
then we will not be
able to stop anyone.

190
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,060
Vrushali, stop

191
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,100
otherwise you shall
be imprisoned.

192
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,900
Soldier!

193
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,900
Arrest this maiden!

194
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,890
King Karna of Anga!

195
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,020
King Karna of Anga

196
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,890
you had said that your mother
had renounced you

197
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,790
and that you did not
renounce her.

198
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,860
Then what happened today,
King Karna of Anga

199
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,890
that you had to renounce
the righteousness

200
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,060
and values taught
by your mother?

201
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,990
King Karna of Anga

202
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,020
this maiden said

203
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,960
that unrighteousness
resides not in a man

204
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,930
but in his crown.

205
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,930
My father,
my husband

206
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,960
and my son

207
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,960
have a crown on their heads.

208
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,730
That is why,
I request you

209
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,990
to not let the words
of this maiden come true.

210
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,730
Release this maiden.

211
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,370
Release this maiden.

212
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,200
Soldier.

213
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,200
King of Anga!

214
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,430
Do not argue with me,
Dusshasan.

215
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,290
It is the order of a mother.

216
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,460
Aunt Kunti

217
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,360
the order of His Highness
cannot be disobeyed.

218
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,290
I am still the Queen Mother,
dear Dusshasan.

219
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,330
And the order of His Highness
is meant for everyone.

220
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,220
I am

221
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,430
asking to make an exception
only for this maiden

222
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,330
who has a heart
that knows the truth

223
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,330
and also the dignity
to speak it out loud.

224
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,170
I have firm faith
in my brother-in-law.

225
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,200
He will not disregard
my request.

226
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,370
This maiden shall stay
in my protection.

227
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,360
When I leave for the
reverence of Indraprastha

228
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,260
I shall take her to her father.

229
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,100
King Karna of Anga

230
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,170
unrighteousness resides
not in the crown

231
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,270
but in the greed to have one.

232
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,300
Do you regard your greed

233
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,370
to be your duty?
