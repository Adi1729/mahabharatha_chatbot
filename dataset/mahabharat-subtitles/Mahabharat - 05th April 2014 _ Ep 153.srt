1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,170
Servant!

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,140
Bring that maid Draupadi

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,170
in this royal court.

4
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,040
Handmaid

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
what's the news?

6
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,010
It's a sad news, Your Highness.

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,080
For a lady divested
of the title of the empress

8
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,970
has no end to her
pain and insult.

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
What do you mean?

10
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,030
Your Highness

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,980
you've been ordered at once to
be present at the royal court.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,170
Who the heck are you?

13
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,080
How dare you enter my room
without permission!

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,970
Fool!
Get out of here!

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,010
I am the charioteer
of Emperor Duryodhan.

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,110
Please come along to abide by
Emperor Duryodhan's order.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,140
My husband has lost
merely the game of gambling

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,970
not his life!

19
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,940
I don't take anyone's orders
apart from my husbands.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,170
But the slaves don't have rights
to order, Your Highness.

21
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,010
King Yudhishthira had lost
himself in the gambling

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,910
along with you.

23
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,100
Now you are
Emperor Duryodhan's maid.

24
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,110
Please come.

25
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,910
Go and tell Duryodhan

26
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,970
that Empress Draupadi refuses

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,840
to be lost by Yudhishthira
in the game of gambling.

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,000
The already cut down tree

29
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,070
can neither grow
new leaves in the spring

30
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,840
nor can lose them in the autumn.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,980
If Yudhishthira

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,030
had already lost himself
in the gambling

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
he had no right to stake me!

34
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,940
Go

35
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,810
tell Duryodhan.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Go!

37
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,970
Draupadi is right,
Your Highness.

38
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,870
If Yudhishthira had already
lost himself in the gambling

39
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,770
he had no right
to stake his wife.

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,970
That means

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,910
when Yudhishthira lost himself
along with his property

42
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,880
he lost even his wife.

43
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,940
No.

44
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,900
It's the person
who has a right on the property

45
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,810
not vice versa.

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,770
The husband
as well as the wife

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,780
both have a right on each other.

48
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,000
A wife,
certified by the scriptures

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,970
and revered by the society

50
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,970
can never be taken
as her husband's property.

51
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,870
Therefore, the moment
Yudhishthira lost himself

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,880
he had not lost Draupadi.

53
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,800
That means, neither
Yudhishthira lost Draupadi

54
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,710
nor did he have a right
to lose her.

55
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,880
Is that what
all of you want to prove?

56
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,710
In that case, all of you let
an utmost inequity take place

57
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,830
in this royal court.

58
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,740
None of you has a right
to be in this royal court.

59
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,810
Karna... - Please calm down,
Master Drona.

60
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,780
You won't get answer to such a
difficult question like this.

61
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,830
We must ask

62
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,870
the most righteous person
for this answer.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,740
Tell me, slave Yudhishthira.

64
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,840
Your silence
will be taken as falsity.

65
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,810
Tell me.

66
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,710
Was losing Draupadi right

67
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,740
or wrong?

68
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,840
Please remain mum, brother.

69
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
Please don't mind committing
such a petty inequity, today.

70
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,740
But please remain mum.

71
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,640
Speak up, slave Yudhishthira.

72
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Was staking Draupadi right

73
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,730
or wrong?

74
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,840
If...

75
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,630
If losing my four brothers
was right

76
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,870
then losing Draupadi

77
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
wasn't wrong.

78
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,810
What have you done, brother!

79
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,680
Did you pay heed, Master Drona?

80
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Dushasan

81
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,700
bring that handmaid
in the royal court.

82
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,570
If that egoistic lady

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,740
refuses to accept my order

84
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,830
hold her by her hair

85
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,770
and bring over here, dragging.

86
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,670
Dushasan!

87
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,570
If you even touch her

88
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,630
I would kill you!

89
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Keep quiet!

90
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,800
Just keep quiet, slave!

91
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,530
You can't do anything.

92
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,670
You are bound by dharma.

93
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,730
I have attained
that slave Draupadi

94
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,530
as per the dharma.

95
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
To heck with your dharma!

96
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,540
Don't forget, Duryodhan

97
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,510
that God lies in 'Shivlinga'*
*Symbolic rock of Shiva.

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,610
but upon hitting with the stone

99
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,630
it yields the sparks!

100
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,510
I will burn you to ashes!

101
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,700
Stop yelling

102
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,540
slave Arjun.

103
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,740
If you want to commit
the wrong

104
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,630
go ahead.

105
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,610
Even we want to witness

106
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,470
how you insult

107
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,710
your elder brother Yudhishthira.

108
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,670
Tell Yudhishthira

109
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,570
that you don't accept
the limit set by him.

110
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,570
Tell him

111
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,630
that you have nothing
to do with his defeat.

112
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,580
Take your weapons

113
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,440
and leave this royal court!

114
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,630
We will set you free.

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,570
Go!

116
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,630
Dushasan, go.

117
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,480
Bring that handmaid
in this royal court.

118
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,370
Your Highness

119
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,380
Prince Dushasan
is entering your room.

120
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,340
Handmaid Draupadi

121
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,470
you were ordered to be present
in the royal court!

122
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,410
Don't cross your limit, Prince!

123
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,500
Even the entire farm
of dried straws

124
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,410
can't bind
even the smallest ember.

125
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,400
In the same way,
you hundred brothers

126
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
will burn to ashes!

127
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,480
Shut up, slave Draupadi!

128
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,370
Your five husbands

129
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,430
have already been shut up
by Emperor Duryodhan.

130
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Come!

131
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,430
I warn you, Prince.

132
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,530
You will have to face the
consequences of this insolence.

133
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
'Consequences'!

134
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,340
It is the desire of bearing
the consequences

135
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,500
for which you're being
called to the court.

136
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,310
Wicked man!

137
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,780
Wicked man!

138
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,910
How dare you insult me?

139
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,710
If you have the guts

140
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,840
then take the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru lineage

141
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,910
in the presence
of the empress.

142
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,770
You scoundrel!

143
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,810
My curse will destroy you.

144
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,740
No!

145
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Come!
- You scoundrel!

146
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,770
Leave me!

147
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,510
Your freedom!
Your honour!

148
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,810
Yudhisthira lost everything.

149
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,510
Come!

150
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,310
Leave me, you wicked man...

151
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,870
Dushasana! 

152
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,000
The hands that have dared
to touch Draupadi's pious hair...

153
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,040
I vow to rip those hands off!

154
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,870
Dushasana

155
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,940
when one's pride
is destroyed

156
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,900
it is the face that is
blackened first.

157
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,810
Let me see this
proud woman's face.
