1
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,380
Sister!

2
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,220
What are you doing?

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,190
I am bidding my sword goodbye.

4
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,260
Now, this sword will assume
the form of the Almighty

5
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,320
and help me reform my life.

6
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,290
I have failed the purpose
of my birth today.

7
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,180
No, sister.

8
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,350
Do not say that.

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,420
You do not know, Draupadi

10
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,230
but I was born
to deal with weapons.

11
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,290
Flowers not only emit fragrance

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,320
but also look beautiful
and provide seeds.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,350
But a thorn...

14
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,320
A thorn is born
only to prick others.

15
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,360
What...

16
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,300
What do I now, Draupadi?

17
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,290
The people who do not
succeed in the battlefield

18
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,320
do they also not
succeed in life, sister?

19
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,260
I cannot be.

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,200
If ember loses its fire
it is nothing but coal.

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,260
Dark and ugly.

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,230
The person who touches it
becomes dirty.

23
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,260
If the fire within me dies out

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,230
I too shall become so!

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,090
The way

26
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,360
a serpent is born with
a poison pouch in its mouth

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,320
similarly, I was born
with anger and vengeance.

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,290
It is a tie of my
previous life, Draupadi.

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,350
If I do not hold a weapon

30
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,250
my entire being gets
filled with dejection.

31
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,160
To be the General of Panchal
is the basis of my life.

32
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,220
But

33
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,160
father snatched this basis
from me today.

34
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,060
He rendered all my efforts
fruitless today.

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
That can never happen, sister.

36
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,050
Father shall certainly
reappoint you as the General.

37
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,220
I shall talk to him.

38
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,160
You... You need
to come with me, sister.

39
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,060
You need to come with me.

40
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,030
Father will never listen
to you, Draupadi.

41
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,030
He shall indeed listen to me.

42
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,030
I was born from
a sacrificial fire.

43
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,960
I am a blessing of the Gods.

44
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,030
Did father not say so himself?

45
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,090
He shall certainly listen to me.

46
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,200
You need to come
with me, sister.

47
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,150
Come with me, sister.

48
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,120
Let's go, sister.

49
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,930
Come with me, sister.

50
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,890
Greetings, father.

51
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,150
May you be invincible.

52
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,020
Father.

53
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,880
Father

54
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,000
sister deserves this respect.

55
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,990
Without any apparent reason
how can you take this right

56
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,890
away from sister?

57
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,950
How dare you question
your own father?

58
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,890
Only a father can answer
the questions of his children.

59
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,830
In order to question
one's father

60
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,950
a child only requires
a question.

61
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,860
One does not require
courage for it.

62
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,890
Quit with your rambling,
Draupadi!

63
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,750
Shikhandini has
murdered my trust.

64
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,830
She was supposed
to slay Bhishma

65
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,760
but was defeated
by the Kuru Princes!

66
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,950
How will she
defeat Bhishma then?!

67
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,760
She has proven the prediction
of the Gods to be false!

68
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,800
Even Dhrishtadyumna was given
to you by the Gods, father.

69
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,890
If you have faith
in Dhrishtadyumna

70
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,860
then why not in sister?

71
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,920
Because she is a woman!

72
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,690
Women can bear jewellery

73
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,920
but not swords!

74
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,860
Goddess Durga* is also a woman, father.
*Goddess of Victory of Good over Evil, "the invincible", the most popular incarnation of Devi/Goddess Shakti--the female aspect of the divine.

75
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,830
She bears not one
but ten weapons.

76
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,890
The way I am a blessing
of the Gods to you

77
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,880
similarly

78
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,730
sister is also
a gift of the Gods.

79
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,890
I do not require
any such gift or blessing.

80
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,660
You do not require it?

81
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,690
Father

82
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,730
why did you ask for me from Agni Dev* then?
*The god of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices.

83
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,630
I did not ask for you!

84
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,730
The Gods have sent you
because of their intransigence!

85
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,890
They have sent you
by defeating me!

86
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,820
The truth is that you are
a symbol of my weakness!

87
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,590
You and that Shikhandini!

88
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,820
The two of you remind me
of my defeat!

89
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,990
The two of you remind me
of my defeat!

90
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,000
You cannot insult your children
in this manner, father.

91
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,160
One who does not get
respect from one's father

92
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,070
to that person, no respect

93
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,260
can ever make him happy.

94
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,200
I, your daughter, father

95
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,200
beg of you

96
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
to not commit injustice
by destroying

97
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,000
sister's self-confidence.

98
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,070
This is not injustice.

99
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,190
This is a punishment!

100
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,230
Punishment for being defeated!

101
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,230
Because I never accept defeat!

102
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,930
But in that battle

103
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,940
were you also
not defeated, father?

104
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,970
Then why punish only sister?

105
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,160
If you wish to stay alive

106
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,130
then go from here.

107
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,030
Otherwise, for committing the
crime of insulting your father

108
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,130
you shall be sent
to the gallows!

109
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,060
There is no place for you
in Kampilya any longer!

110
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,060
Go!

111
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,900
Go!

112
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,830
No, father!

113
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,870
Please pardon her.

114
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,060
Guard

115
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,030
this maiden has been banished
from the city of Kampilya!

116
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,930
Take her to the gates
of the city!

117
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,970
Right away!

118
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,320
Take her to the gates
of the city!

119
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,320
Right away!

120
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,320
If this is your order, father

121
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,350
then I shall certainly go away.

122
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,320
I am your daughter.

123
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,480
If I stay here after this insult

124
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,510
it will tarnish your reputation.

125
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,370
Draupadi, no.

126
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,470
Draupadi..

127
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,370
No, Draupadi.

128
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,540
Stop, Draupadi.

129
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Stop!

130
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,380
Father, stop Draupadi.

131
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,540
Father, she has no
knowledge of the world.

132
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,340
Who will protect her?

133
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,280
Please do not banish
my sister, father.

134
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,500
Stop her.

135
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,310
Stop, Draupadi!

136
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,270
Father

137
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,400
I apologize on her behalf.

138
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,340
Please pardon us.

139
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,340
Draupadi, stop!

140
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,330
'I did not ask for you!'

141
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,310
'The Gods have sent you
because of their intransigence!'

142
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,410
'The truth is that you are
a symbol of my weakness!'

143
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,340
'They have sent you by defeating
me! You and that Shikhandini!'

144
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,280
'There is no place for you
in Kampilya any longer!'

145
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,400
'Go!'

146
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,440
'If you wish to stay alive'

147
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,410
'then go from here.'

148
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,270
'Otherwise, for committing the
crime of insulting your father'

149
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,140
'you shall be sent
to the gallows!'

150
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,250
'This maiden has been banished
from the city of Kampilya!'

151
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,210
'Take her to the gates
of the city!'

152
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,180
'Go!'
