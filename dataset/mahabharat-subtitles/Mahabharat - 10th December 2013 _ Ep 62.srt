1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,060
Who is the real
King of Panchal, Drupad?

2
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,010
You have been defeated,
Kuru Prince!

3
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,120
The 104 brothers of yours
have also been captured!

4
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,950
Today, your grandfather
will be very proud

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,920
upon knowing of your capability!

6
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,090
Did your teacher

7
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,990
not teach you how to navigate
through this discus formation?

8
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,010
This is the discus formation
of King Drupad!

9
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,890
King Drupad's discus formation!

10
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,850
I will not kill you!

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
I will have your head shaved

12
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,820
and a donkey will be your ride
back to Hastinapur!

13
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,050
But before that

14
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,790
your grandfather
will have to come here!

15
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,080
Bhishma will have to come here!
Bhishma!

16
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,860
My daughter Shikhandini
will avenge my father's defeat.

17
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,790
On one hand, there are
the lives of the 105 Princes!

18
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,780
And on the other

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,990
the life of Bhishma!

20
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,950
Your Majesty,
they are just 100 Princes.

21
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,750
How is that possible?

22
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,950
The messenger had said that

23
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
105 Princes were coming
to fight in the battle!

24
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,820
Where are the other five?

25
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,720
Arjun, only you can navigate
through this discus formation.

26
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,820
You shall lead.
- As you say.

27
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,850
Not from there,
brother Yudhishthir.

28
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,680
From the West.

29
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,760
Brother Bheem, Nakul, Sahadev

30
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,650
do not enter from the gates.

31
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
The soldiers have
formed a fortress.

32
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,750
There is no
visible entrance, Arjun.

33
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,610
More soldiers?

34
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
Does no one know
anything about fighting?

35
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,250
Come here...
Come here.

36
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,120
Friend, those soldiers
are my enemies.

37
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,280
But their horses are my friends.

38
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,190
Tell them to let me through.

39
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,050
This is my discus formation!

40
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,090
Enter it, if you can!

41
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,950
Arjun, you need to
find a way out of this.

42
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,050
We must get back
to our brothers.

43
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,920
Do you remember
what mother said?

44
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,010
Together, we are indestructible.

45
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,110
If I knew, there would be
so many soldiers

46
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,050
I would have had a bigger meal.

47
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,080
Now, I need to have
a big meal after the battle.

48
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,040
Brother Bheem

49
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,990
did you defeat
just these many soldiers?

50
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
But I did not fall.

51
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,050
Then here you go.

52
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,920
Let's go, Nakul.

53
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,050
Drupad and the Kauravas
must be in there

54
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,820
surrounded by the soldiers.

55
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,940
We need to go there.

56
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,920
Sahadev, free all our brothers.

57
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,880
Must I do this?

58
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,010
Do not say that, Sahadev.

59
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,050
They are our brothers.

60
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,990
Them being captured
is our defeat.

61
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,850
Duryodhan, start freeing
the rest of our brothers.

62
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,990
We do not require your help.

63
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,010
Our father can free us.

64
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Duryodhan, 105 of us
Kuru Princes have come here.

65
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,790
We need to be victorious
as a team.

66
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,750
We are the Kauravas

67
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,950
and you five are the Pandavas.

68
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,020
Never forget this.
Besides

69
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,910
if we could not
find a way out of this

70
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,790
then how will the five of you
figure it out?

71
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,560
Besides

72
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,490
if we could not
find a way out of this

73
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,560
then how will the five of you
figure it out?

74
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,550
Nakul!

75
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,230
Accept your defeat, King Drupad.

76
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,220
King Drupad who?

77
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,330
Are you certain Kuru Prince
that I am the King of Panchal

78
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,390
Drupad?

79
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Or maybe I am
the King of Panchal, Drupad!

80
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,310
King Drupad who?
Are you certain Kuru Prince

81
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,470
that I am
the King of Panchal, Drupad?

82
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,340
Or maybe I am
the King of Panchal, Drupad!

83
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,340
Or maybe I am.

84
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,310
Even I can be him.

85
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,320
You have been defeated, Prince!

86
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,180
'What is this?'

87
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,270
'Brother Krishna said,
if you keep this with you'

88
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,350
'it will be of use to you
in the battle.'

89
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,150
'Did Krishna send these stones
to me for this very moment?'

90
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,270
'Do the five stones
symbolize the five Drupads?'

91
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,080
'Only one of the stones has
the eye right at the center'

92
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,310
'indicating that only one
of the Drupads is real.'

93
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,250
'In other words,
he is the real King Drupad.'

94
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Not one but five Drupads.

95
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,980
Your illusion of the Five Gems
was fantastic, Your Majesty.

96
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,050
However, had you
advised your look-alikes

97
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,240
not to steal glances at you
for their next order

98
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,070
then maybe you would
have been successful.
