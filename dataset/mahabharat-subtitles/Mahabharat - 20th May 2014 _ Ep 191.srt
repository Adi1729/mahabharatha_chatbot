1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,450
On behalf of Hastinapur

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,560
I have arrived with a message
from King Dhritarashtra

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,420
O sons of Pandu!

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,520
Before plunging the entire Arya
clan down the path of battle

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,660
it is necessary that both sides
ruminate over their thoughts.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,360
This is a request
by his Majesty.

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,360
The battle had begun
that very day, Sanjay...

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,560
When Draupadi was dragged

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,460
into the royal court
unnecessarily...

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,580
When that brute laid hands

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,550
upon Draupadis drapes...

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,420
The royal court where
Draupadis drapes were yanked

13
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,360
represented the Arya clan.

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,450
It represented humanity.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,460
It symbolised the faith
of all women in the world.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,430
So, justice shall be done
for that.

17
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,420
The time to ruminate

18
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,420
was before the royal courts
incident, Sire Sanjay.

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,360
Go tell your King

20
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,390
to rather ruminate
over his battle strategies.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,420
There are two perspectives to
every incident, sons of Pandu.

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,320
If you put forth one perspective
the sons of Dhritarashtra

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,390
will put forth the other.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,290
It is futile to debate over an
incident of the past, Pandavas.

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,380
Demise and insult
can never be the past!

26
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,490
A persons demise,
that is, his death

27
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,560
can affect all the lives
affiliated to his own.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,420
A persons insult

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,530
affect his present life!

30
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,290
You speak the truth
revered Sanjay.

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,330
There are two perspectives
to an incident.

32
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,450
And when a battle is fought
when the perspectives conflict

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,430
only then can it be decided
as to whose perspective is true.

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,490
I approve of your anger,
King Dhrupad.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,350
But this battle shall have
dire consequences.

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,450
You know, My Lord

37
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,290
that youths are sacrificed
in a battle

38
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,220
and what is left behind
are children and aged ones.

39
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,480
The old ones,
who have no direction

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,460
and children,
who have no one to guide them.

41
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,380
By the screams of widows

42
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,450
this world will be rendered
poisonous, My Lord.

43
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,360
If the atrocious ones
come into power

44
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,350
the potential of the youth
is destroyed.

45
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,450
The future of the children
is destroyed.

46
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,320
The aged ones perish.

47
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,250
The honour of women is violated.

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,420
Penance, justice, customs
and practices are destroyed.

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,390
Whatever losses are
caused by this battle

50
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,420
seem greater than that
in peace to me.

51
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,390
Justice can be established
even without a war, O Pandavas!

52
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,390
Put forth a proposal
before King Dhritarashtra

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,390
that establishes justice and
causes no destruction either.

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,220
Even King Dhritarasthra's mind

55
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,220
is worried by the possibility
of battle, O Princes.

56
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,320
He shall agree to any choice

57
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,260
to gain your approval
and restore your honour.

58
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,330
Now, if this clan
faces destruction

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,390
his wisened heart
will suffer immense pain.

60
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,160
If you do not approve
of this proposal

61
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,090
then...

62
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,290
Then you may continue
with the battle.

63
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,160
But peace should be
given a chance, O Princes.

64
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,120
Before the declaration of a war

65
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,360
attempting to call for a truce
once

66
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,220
is a royal obligation.

67
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,320
Lord Krishna,

68
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,330
what is your
opinion about this topic?

69
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,090
I have no opinion whatsoever,
revered minister.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,060
A person may have his eyes
open or closed

71
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,220
when the sun rises
even with his eyes closed

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,230
he perceives light.

73
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,250
Similarly, one may
follow his duties or not

74
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,030
he surely is aware
of his duties.

75
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,190
I am confident
that brother Yudishtir

76
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,190
is aware of his duties.

77
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,250
What have you all decided?

78
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,130
Draupadi, attempting for a truce
before a battle

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,060
is a royal obligation.

80
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,990
And we cannot overlook
our obligations.

81
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,080
What does Krishna have to say?

82
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Eldest brother has
requested Krishna

83
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,050
to visit Hastinapur
with a peace proposal.

84
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,050
And Krishna is of the belief

85
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,090
that one may follow
his duties or not

86
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,020
he is always aware
of his duties.

87
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,220
We must fight this battle
to vanquish the tyrants

88
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,050
and establish justice.

89
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,230
Apart from your five husbands

90
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,990
all the descendants
of King Shantanu may perish! [WOMAN SING]

91
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,160
The entire family of King Pandu
must make sacrifices

92
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,190
or accept the tyranny of
the sons of King Dhritarashtra!

93
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,160
[MUSIC STOPS]

94
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,990
A Peace proposal?

95
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,020
We cannot send
a peace proposal, My Lord!

96
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,960
How can we forget
our honour and our duty?

97
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,960
The one who ill-treats a woman

98
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,150
must be punished by death!

99
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,990
This isn't a war,
but an attempt to reformation.

100
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,150
This is a revolution!

101
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,890
And a revolution has no peace,
O Arya Princes!

102
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,050
Krishna cannot go ahead
with this peace proposal!

103
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,050
Where is Krishna?

104
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,950
[HORSE NEIGHING]

105
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,780
Krishna!

106
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
I ruminated upon your words!

107
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,890
I strengthened my heart.

108
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,850
I accepted all pains.

109
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,790
In spite of so many difficulties

110
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,920
when I swore to make a sacrifice

111
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,790
you have decided
against all of it?

112
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,920
Attempting at peace before a war

113
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,750
is inevitable, Draupadi.

114
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,010
And what if the proposal
is accepted

115
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,790
won't there be a war, Krishna?

116
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,830
This is the decision
of the sons of Pandu.

117
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,930
They have no rights to make
such a decision, Krishna.

118
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,720
I was the one who was
humiliated in the courtroom.

119
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,850
I was the one who was
dishonored, Krishna.

120
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,920
If the entire Arya clan
mocks someone

121
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,950
it is me.

122
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,950
My sons have to suffer the pain
of my mockery, Krishna.

123
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,920
Therefore only I shall decide

124
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,750
whether to fight a war
or not to.

125
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,850
No, Draupadi!

126
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
The decision for war

127
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,880
cannot be made
either for revenge

128
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,860
or to prove ones sanctity
to others.

129
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,890
The decision for war
can be made only for justice.

130
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,930
Only I have the rights
to demand justice, Krishna.

131
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,720
Indeed!

132
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,790
If you demand for justice
you will indeed get it.

133
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,860
This is my word.
- But how, Krishna?

134
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,780
You are going there
to have talks of peace.

135
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,920
How will you make it
culminate into battle?

136
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,780
Have faith, Draupadi.

137
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,780
Not just in me

138
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,750
but also in Duryodhan.

139
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,890
There shall indeed be a war!

140
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,730
Will we be able to
capture Krishna, uncle?

141
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,600
Why this doubt, my lad?

142
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,570
I have heard many tales
about him, uncle.

143
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,600
He is a sorcerer,
an illusionist.

144
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,630
Some even behold him
as an incarnation of God.

145
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,740
All those are futile talks.

146
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,640
Accepting fear as God
is human nature.

147
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,530
And the nature of fear is

148
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,600
one fear gives

149
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,790
rise
to another fear.

150
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,760
In reality

151
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Krishna is
a mere human.

152
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,660
He is far more powerful

153
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,640
and his wisdom

154
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,630
sometimes even baffles me.

155
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,570
But a God...

156
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
is something he is not.

157
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,570
Fear giving rise to fears

158
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,500
is happening in your mind,
uncle.

159
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,500
I do not fear Krishna at all!

160
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,730
He had the army of Narayana

161
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,560
which is now with me!

162
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,630
He is unarmed.

163
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,640
So what harm could he cause?

164
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,660
The scriptures say

165
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,660
one wrestler is mightier
than two scholars.

166
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,700
Because he can land a blow

167
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,690
on each scholars head

168
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,600
and teach them of
the path to heaven. [LAUGHING]

169
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,500
My lad!

170
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,490
Do not be so haughtily proud

171
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,530
of your might.

172
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,570
It is difficult even

173
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,690
to breach close to a clever man

174
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,630
If Krishna has sided

175
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,460
with the Pandavas

176
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,670
even my deceit cannot help you
attain victory.

177
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,690
Remember!

178
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,660
Even the most skilled warriors
on your side

179
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,440
are all influenced by Krishna.

180
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,470
Your friend, the armored Karna

181
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,600
respects Krishna.

182
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,440
That old Bhairav

183
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,490
considers Krishna to be great.

184
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,630
Kripacharya, Dronacharya,
Vidur, all of them

185
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,570
fear Krishna.

186
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,500
If Krishna
enters the battlefield

187
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,470
representing the Pandavas

188
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,570
the might of all of
your skilled warriors

189
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,530
will be cleaved in halves.

190
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,630
Therefore

191
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,370
capturing Krishna

192
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,440
and imprisoning him
is a good move.

193
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,330
[LAUGHING]

194
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,430
I shall capture him.

195
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,400
In front of the entire
royal court

196
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,330
I shall capture him.

197
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
Everyone shall know

198
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,300
whether the greatness of Krishna
is true

199
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,430
or a mere legend.
[LAUGHING]

200
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,580
By the end of the meeting

201
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,650
all of them shall be laughing
at Krishna, uncle.

202
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,590
His respect will be reduced
to mockery

203
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,620
when he is in prison.

204
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,390
Be quiet, my lad!

205
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,480
He might overhear us.

206
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,420
Will he hear us
from so far, uncle?

207
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,350
I suspect that this person

208
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,390
overhears everything.

209
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,550
Greetings, Your Highness!

210
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,320
Bless you, Krishna!

211
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,320
I am here with a message
from the sons of Pandu.

212
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,320
O the supreme Yadava!

213
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,290
A flute just transforms
gusts of air into tunes.

214
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,520
But the ability to transform
Pandavas message into knowledge

215
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,450
can be possessed only by you.

216
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,350
My Lord, listening to
the tunes of my flute

217
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,250
the cows of Brindavan
yielded more milk.

218
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,320
But donkeys used to bray
tunes of their own.

219
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,450
The importance of tunes
lies with the listener, My Lord!

220
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,390
Greetings to the Queen!

221
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Welcome to Hastinapur, Krishna!

222
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,480
The conflicting turn
that the Kuru clan stands at

223
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,280
only you can guide it
towards the path of peace.

224
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,290
There is only one path
to life, O Queen!

225
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
The travelers mind makes it

226
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,290
either a path of peace

227
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,260
or that of conflict.

228
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,420
But I assure you

229
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,210
that I shall sincerely try

230
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,410
to avoid any conflict.
