1
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,452
'A person who is
blind since birth'

2
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:17,356
'is unworthy
of becoming the king.'

3
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,200
'When all the sons
are equally worthy'

4
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,240
'only then does the eldest son
have this right, Queen Mother.'

5
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,254
My lord..

6
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,324
Avoid!

7
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,401
I said, avoid!

8
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,407
Right now, I am not in a state
to converse with anyone.

9
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,227
Today my decision
to blindfold my eyes

10
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,255
seems worth it.

11
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,236
The world that does such
injustice to my husband

12
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:32,339
is unworthy to be looked at.

13
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:41,212
Pardon me, Prince.

14
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,443
The ministers of the court
have decided

15
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:48,254
that they will..
- Coronate Pandu as the king.

16
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,423
I knew it.

17
00:01:57,332 --> 00:02:00,392
I am sure, he must have
been ecstatic. Am I right?

18
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:04,166
Who could be happy
at this decision, Queen Mother?

19
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,175
This will fill
my entire life with grief.

20
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:16,246
Grandsire

21
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:22,246
I am but a servant
to my elder brother

22
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:27,384
and for a servant,
his duties are his ornaments.

23
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:33,393
I have taken an oath to serve
my brother since birth.

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,295
I can take his side

25
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,364
not his place.

26
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:43,243
Something that inflicts a wound

27
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:46,245
and then applies an ointment
of words on it is politics.

28
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,282
I had no idea
when he learnt all this.

29
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:52,445
Pandu..

30
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,193
Then grandsire must have said

31
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,389
that keeping the pain
and dejection of oneself

32
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:07,367
locked up in one's heart
and carrying out one's duties

33
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:10,199
is the duty of every prince.

34
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:14,301
And you must bear this duty
on your shoulders.

35
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,343
A person can never be
greater than the throne

36
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,180
and love

37
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,189
can never be
greater than duties.

38
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:34,294
If through meditation,
rituals or medication

39
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,397
we could coronate
Dhritarashtra as the king

40
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,190
then we would have
gladly waited for it

41
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,236
but the situation is not so.

42
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,164
Dhritarashtra will

43
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,303
never be able to see.

44
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,274
That is why

45
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,276
in the best interest
of the entire Kingdom of Kuru

46
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,253
the responsibility
of this kingdom

47
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:03,323
falls to you.

48
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,330
Only after
everyone requested him

49
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:13,366
did Prince Pandu
say in the royal court

50
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,397
that during
the exile of Lord Ram

51
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:19,265
Bharat had carried out
the duties of the throne

52
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:23,334
similarly, he too would
carry out the royal duties.

53
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:38,383
So, have you come here
to take my slippers, soldier?

54
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:43,254
Will Pandu place them on
the throne and sit at its base?

55
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,324
What is the point of this act?

56
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,430
Even Lord Ram had been
exiled for 14 years

57
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,300
but in my case

58
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,268
everyone has sentenced me

59
00:04:57,412 --> 00:05:00,176
to a lifelong exile.

60
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,212
A lifelong exile.

61
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,191
He is not Bharat.

62
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:14,262
He will not give up
the throne for anyone.

63
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,230
Neither will he
give it up for me

64
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,190
nor for my children.

65
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:28,265
Now, the Kuru dynasty
will be furthered by Pandu.

66
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:33,372
Now, the future
of blind Dhritarashtra

67
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,179
will be in darkness.

68
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:39,353
In darkness.

69
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,292
I have been tied
to this darkness forever

70
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:48,388
by that Pandu.

71
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:51,427
That Pandu has
tied me to it forever.

72
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,436
Son Shakuni.

73
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:30,410
Son, is time for us to leave.

74
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,553
I too was thinking
of this, mother.

75
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:52,462
Get up, Chandal!

76
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,498
Get up, dear Pishaach!

77
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:56,469
It is the order of my father.

78
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,404
We must leave.
Let's go.

79
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,636
Now, Gandhari's..

80
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:06,605
Now, Gandhari's
silent sacrifice..

81
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,507
Come on.

82
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,611
Pardon me, mother.

83
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:16,413
My dice refuse to budge.

84
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:20,426
Why are you joking, Shakuni?
- It's no joke, Your Highness.

85
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,459
Leave.

86
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,565
I am not joking, Your Highness.

87
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,398
I explained it
to the two of them

88
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:30,365
that we must return to Gandhar

89
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:31,496
but these two..

90
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,475
Shame is keeping them
from getting up, sire.

91
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,503
Isn't the name
of our ancestral kingdom

92
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,583
Purushpura, father?

93
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,452
But if you and l,
a king and a prince

94
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,614
return to Gandhar with
such an insult to our chivalry

95
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,586
then what will we
tell our subjects?

96
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:56,596
Shall we call
the 'land of men'

97
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:59,399
the 'land of eunuchs'?

98
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:04,469
This is what these impudent
fellows here say, father.

99
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,562
This is what they say.

100
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,474
Our insult?
Who insulted us, Shakuni?

101
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,579
This was Gandhari's fate.
- Fate!

102
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,639
Fate!

103
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,452
If fate cannot be trusted like
a gamble, father

104
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,386
then I will not side with fate

105
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:24,356
but with a gamble!

106
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,550
With a gamble!

107
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:29,620
At least before they
fall to the ground

108
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,625
these dice are in my hand.

109
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,566
I throw them in the air.

110
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:37,460
No one throws them
on my behalf, father.

111
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,468
But you have given
the dice of our lives

112
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:45,603
in the hands of that Bhishma,
father.

113
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,444
In the hands of that Bhishma.

114
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,553
That is why we have been
treated so poorly.

115
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:58,614
Gandhari has met with
great injustice, father.

116
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,461
She has met with injustice

117
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,591
and this truth is

118
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,459
piercing my heart
like a dagger, father.

119
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:12,563
Piercing my heart

120
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,404
like a dagger!

121
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,602
Shakuni!
Son..

122
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,607
Son, what have you done?

123
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,424
How can anyone stab oneself
with a dagger, son?

124
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,361
What have you done?

125
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,590
Father

126
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,433
this wound will remind me

127
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:46,634
of the great injustice
done to Gandhari.

128
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:52,512
You may proceed towards Gandhar.

129
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,440
I shall stay right here
in Hastinapur.

130
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,454
And until

131
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:04,516
I make dear Gandhari

132
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,657
the Queen of the Kuru dynasty

133
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,661
the Kuru dynasty will not

134
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:15,501
experience an iota of happiness
because

135
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,529
I won't allow it.

136
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,498
They won't experience

137
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:24,444
an iota of happiness

138
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,438
because I won't allow it!

139
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:49,492
When one deems
an incident to be unjust

140
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:53,505
then that incident
shakes up his psyche.

141
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:57,567
The entire world seems
like an enemy to him.

142
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:03,378
The greater the intensity of
the incident that seems unjust

143
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:07,478
the greater is the protest done
by the heart of man.

144
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:14,492
In reply to that incident,
he asks for justice.

145
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,394
And this is apt.

146
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:20,592
In reality, any form
of injustice in the society

147
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:25,405
destroys the belief and faith

148
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,599
of a person.

149
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:29,534
But

150
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:32,407
what is justice?

151
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,638
What does justice mean?

152
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:41,385
The one who was unjust
ought to repent

153
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,614
and the one
who experienced injustice

154
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:47,584
ought to renew faith
in his heart about society.

155
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,462
Does this not sum up
the meaning of justice?

156
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,559
But an unrighteous person

157
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:58,469
renounces justice and
embraces enmity and revenge.

158
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,605
He chooses to defeat violence
with violence.

159
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,376
The one who experienced agony

160
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,418
tries to inflict
greater agony to others.

161
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:16,422
And while walking down
this path, the oppressed

162
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:19,382
becomes the oppressor.

163
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:22,621
Very soon
he turns into a criminal.

164
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,393
In other words

165
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:27,592
there is very little difference
between justice and revenge

166
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:30,562
and this difference is called

167
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,530
righteousness.

168
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,532
Is it not true?

169
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:38,411
Think about it.

170
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,593
Your Highness!

171
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,409
Give me this sword.

172
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:13,451
That is

173
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,419
the difference

174
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:21,620
between you
and Prince Pandu.

175
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,497
You may raise your sword
but you never wound anyone.

176
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,660
But Prince Pandu's sword

177
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:34,462
wounds people
even without being raised.

178
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:36,362
Prince Shakuni

179
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,604
I could not recognise
your footfalls today.

180
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,446
That is because, Your Highness

181
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,446
henceforth I have

182
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:49,444
changed my way of walking.

183
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,616
Change your path along with your
way of walking too, Shakuni.

184
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,650
Gandhar awaits you.

185
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:04,629
I have left Gandhar behind me,
Your Highness.

186
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:09,635
Now my path will follow you.

187
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:14,604
I have changed my path.

188
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:17,447
That is why I have changed
my way of walking too.

189
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:19,517
My path does not
lead anywhere anymore.

190
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,517
My path has been obstructed

191
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,378
forever.

192
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,489
If one ties your feet

193
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:32,519
then one can dampen
only your speed

194
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:36,557
but cannot divert you from
your path, King Dhritarashtra.

195
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:40,399
Stop mocking me by referring
to me as the king, Shakuni.

196
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:42,598
The king of Hastinapur

197
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:46,405
is that Pandu now.

198
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:51,410
King..

199
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:00,550
The sun does not rise during
the night, Your Highness.

200
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:03,484
Then shall we stop
calling it the sun?

201
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,456
When it is day,
the sun rises for sure.

202
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:12,467
You are the sun of Hastinapur.

203
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:19,434
The throne of Hastinapur
had always been yours

204
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:22,607
is yours and will always be so.

205
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,506
When the time is ripe

206
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:29,547
you shall have your right.

207
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:33,491
And how is that?

208
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,358
I do not know right now

209
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:43,561
but I have faith in time.

210
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:49,405
Time always bestows us
with opportunities

211
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:53,509
and the one who makes
the most of an opportunity

212
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:56,514
is the victorious one.

213
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:59,378
Will you teach me deception now?

214
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:02,444
That too against my own family?

215
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:06,420
What family are you talking
about, King Dhritarashtra?

216
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,450
The family

217
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:13,463
that snatched your right
from you?

218
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:18,500
I have to agree,
Your Highness.

219
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,504
You are very generous

220
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:26,372
but in politics,
the other name of generosity

221
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:29,380
is foolishness.
- Shakuni!

222
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:32,643
I shall behead you
for this impudence of yours.

223
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,579
Then do so, Your Highness.
Then do so.

224
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,558
My beloved sister's heart

225
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,621
has already been
broken into bits by you.

226
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:48,430
Now you may chop my body
into many pieces as well.

227
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:54,561
Just for once think about it.
Just once.

228
00:19:56,474 --> 00:20:01,377
When you had returned dejected
from Hastinapur's royal court

229
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,339
then to bear your
dejection and rage

230
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:10,445
my beloved Gandhari
was standing right before you

231
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:13,481
and not your family,
Your Highness.

232
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:19,427
We are folks of the mountain,
Your Highness.

233
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:24,501
The way a mountain
gives away all its water

234
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:26,529
and keeps nothing for itself.

235
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:30,441
Similarly we too give away
all our love.

236
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:35,505
But my beloved sister's
love and dedication

237
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,349
could not be recognised
by you, Your Highness.

238
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,418
Only with her

239
00:20:41,586 --> 00:20:45,386
will you find both happiness
and strength.

240
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,457
Strength?

241
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,651
How can a woman
bestow me with strength?

242
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,393
Woman?

243
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:58,626
Woman!

244
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:05,507
Ravan had only 20 arms

245
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:10,444
and with them he had
picked up Mount Kailash.

246
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:16,450
My beloved sister
can give you 200 arms.

247
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:18,547
200 arms.

248
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:23,357
With them you can lift
not only Hastinapur

249
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,626
but also
the entire region of Arya.

250
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:32,402
The entire region of Arya,
King Dhritarashtra.

251
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:37,567
Goodbye.
