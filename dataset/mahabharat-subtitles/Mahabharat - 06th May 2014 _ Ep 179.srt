1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,560
'Duryodhan will indeed
be punished for his sins.'

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,120
'This is the curse
of Yajnaseni Draupadi!'

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,280
'If your sons have
renounced the Almighty'

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,840
'and embraced opulence'

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,960
'then they are bound
to be slain, Your Highness.'

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,640
'Emperor Dhritarashtra of Kuru,
all your sons will die'

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,120
'at my hands!'

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
'I will rip open Dusshasan's
chest and drink his blood!'

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,000
'The day my sons
gain independence'

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,640
'it will be the end
of all your happiness!'

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,480
'This is the beginning of a war,
King Dhritarashtra.'

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,120
'There will be a blood bath!'

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,640
'There will be a blood bath!'

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,240
'This is the beginning
of Mahabharat!'

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,560
'The day my sons
gain independence'

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,320
'it will be the end
of all your happiness!'

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,720
No...
- 'There will be a blood bath!'

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,560
'Father!
Father, save me!'

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,400
Duryodhan!

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
My Lord!

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,120
My Lord

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
are you alright?

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,800
My Lord...

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,600
'Bheem, please do not drink
the blood from my chest!'

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
'Bheem, please do not drink
the blood from my chest!'

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,160
'Duryodhan, I have killed
99 of your brothers!'

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,000
'Now, I will kill
you as well!'

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
'Brother Bheem,
please do not kill me.'

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,840
'Father,
please save me!'

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,680
'How will that blind man
save you, Vikarna?!'

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,760
'All your brothers
will die at my hands!'

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,520
'I will kill all you brothers!
- Bheem, do not kill me!'

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,480
'I have killed ninety nine...
- Father, save me!'

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
'I will kill you as well!
- Father!'

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,520
'Do not drink my blood...'

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,120
No!

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
'I will kill all you brothers!'

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
Brother.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
Vidur! Vidur,
stop these cries!

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,080
Vidur, stop these cries!
- Brother Dhritarashtra.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Stop these cries, Vidur!
- Brother Dhritarashtra!

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,320
Calm down.

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,920
Calm down.

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,960
Those cries are merely
a figment of your imagination.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,240
However, very soon
those screams

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,880
will be heard
from the battlefield.

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,040
Vidur...

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Vidur,
save my sons!

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Save my sons,
Vidur!

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,920
I can hear their screams
when I am asleep

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,720
and I am tormented
by the thought of their death

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
in my waking hours,
Vidur!

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,480
It seems as though...

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,360
It seems as though
someone is chopping off

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
the parts of my body
one by one, Vidur!

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,240
Someone is chopping off
the parts of my body!

57
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,120
I am in great agony,
Vidur!

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
I am in great agony!

59
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
You will indeed
be in agony, brother.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,960
You had derived joy
from someone's agony, remember?

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,960
The possibility of their joy
will indeed be agonizing now.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Do remember.

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,880
The one to build an embankment
on a river does derive joy

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,680
but along with it,
one also gets surrounded by fear

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
because when
that embankment breaks

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
the river that gave life
to various cities

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,880
drowns them in its waters,
brother.

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,640
The embankment of treachery
made on the Pandavas' competence

69
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,640
has finally broken,
brother.

70
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,160
It will drown all your sons.

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,520
It will drown your sons.

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,680
Be quiet,
Vidur!

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Be quiet,
Vidur!

74
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,600
Be quiet!

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,040
Be quiet.

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,200
If you utter another word
about the death of my sons

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,080
then I will crush you
to death this instant, Vidur!

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,440
I will kill you!

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,720
I am bound to die,
brother.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,320
Merely breathing the air

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,520
does not denote life.

82
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,520
When the heart is robbed of joy

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,160
and the soul is robbed of hope

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
it is called death,
brother.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
With this war

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,080
the prosperity of the Kuru
kingdom will be destroyed.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,400
Millions of young men will die.

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,280
I have dedicated my entire life
to this kingdom.

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,280
When it will be
left impoverished

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,720
I will be as good as dead,
brother.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
You too shall experience
this terrible ordeal.

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
No, Vidur...

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,320
My younger brother.

94
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,360
My beloved brother.

95
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,960
Please show me a way

96
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
out of this dreadful situation,
Vidur.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,480
Please show me a way!

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,040
Even if we seek the refuge
of the Pandavas

99
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,080
they will punish my sons
by sentencing

100
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
them to death,
Vidur!

101
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,920
The Pandavas will punish
my sons by sentencing

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
them to death.

103
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,600
No, they will not.

104
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,960
I have faith that they will not.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,040
Return the Pandavas
their property

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,400
and apologize to them.

107
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Even during the horrific
moments of the game of dice

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,160
when the Pandavas did not
forsake righteousness

109
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,760
they will not do so
now either, brother.

110
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,640
No matter in what form
the Holy Basil is consumed

111
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,000
it does not forsake
its medicinal properties.

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,840
The Pandavas will not forsake
righteousness now either.

113
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,120
Your sons must touch
Draupadi's feet

114
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,960
and apologize
brother.

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
They must atone for their sins

116
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,480
and accept
the punishment as well.

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,920
One thing is clear,
brother.

118
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
Your sons can be saved

119
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,920
only by Draupadi now.

120
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,120
Sister-in-law!

121
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,840
Come and sit,
Subhadra.

122
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,520
Do you know?

123
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,800
It is a tradition
of the Kuru Royal Family

124
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,080
where the mother

125
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,960
ties a protection amulet
on her son before marriage.

126
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,360
Look at this.

127
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,920
I have made this
protection amulet for Abhimanyu.

128
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,920
These five stones

129
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,760
were given to me by Govind.

130
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,520
These five stones represent
the five sons of Pandu.

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,040
I know,
sister-in-law.

132
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
Brother had asked me once
to take these to My Lord.

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
The protection of

134
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,560
all five of his fathers will be
with Abhimanyu with its help.

135
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,640
Where is Abhimanyu?

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
He is in his chamber
with My Lord.

137
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,520
He is getting dressed
for the marriage.

138
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,160
Sister-in-law

139
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,920
you should tie this
on Abhimanyu's arm.

140
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,520
Me?

141
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,600
But why me, Subhadra?
This is...

142
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Because the mantra of his life
is to avenge your insult.

143
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,920
The right to offer him
protection is yours

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
and even the strength
to do so resides in you.

145
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,360
Instead of wearing an armour

146
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
why am I adorning
these ornaments, father?

147
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,480
Madhav was correct.

148
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,720
When a warrior goes to battle

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,120
with the hope of a better life

150
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
he meets with success.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
King Virat has protected us.

152
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
By forging familial ties
with him

153
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,720
we are honouring him.

154
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,560
But if uncle
and Mother Draupadi say

155
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,160
that I cannot go to battle
right after the marriage

156
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,800
then I will have to
disobey them.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,520
When all of you
will be going for the battle

158
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,240
and my brothers will be showing
valour in the battlefield

159
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,840
with weapons in their hands

160
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,080
I will not be able to stay
away from the battlefield.

161
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,160
I promise you

162
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,640
that I will not stop you
from going for the battle.

163
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
However,
if either

164
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,680
you or your brothers
are harmed in the battle

165
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,680
then even after the death
of the hundred Kauravas

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,240
we will be the ones
to be defeated.

167
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,640
That is why, in the battlefield
you will do no such thing

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,120
which is not required.

169
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,480
I will make
no such promise, mother.

170
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,520
I can make only one promise

171
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,440
that I will follow every order
of father Yudhishthir.

172
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,400
That would be adequate.

173
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,160
All five of your fathers
will protect you.

174
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,640
With this protection amulet

175
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,080
I shall bind all the sons
of Pandu to a cause.

176
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,320
The responsibility
of your safety

177
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
will now be theirs.

178
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,240
May you live long!

179
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,480
Do not place the weight

180
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,640
of my safety on the shoulders
of my fathers, Mother Draupadi.

181
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,680
Their shoulders have the weight
of protecting righteousness.

182
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,360
You need not worry,
mother.

183
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,840
I will string these stones
together and wear it on my arm.

184
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,520
As long as a son has
the protection of his mother

185
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,280
he cannot be defeated.

186
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,760
Besides,
I have...

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
I have two mothers.

188
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
Did you call for me,
mother?

189
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
Son Duryodhan

190
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,560
do you see these lamps?

191
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,080
These hundred lamps

192
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,520
represent the lives
of the hundred sons of mine.

193
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,600
Kunti has lit them

194
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,040
and

195
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,080
fate will extinguish them.

196
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,160
Mother

197
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,120
all our lives get extinguished
by nothing but fate.

198
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,760
No, son.

199
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,520
The lives of my sons

200
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,160
will be extinguished
in the battlefield.

201
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,160
This is the curse of Kunti

202
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,000
and the curse of a heart
tormented by injustice

203
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,480
can never be futile.

204
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,440
These things mean nothing,
mother.

205
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
In order to scare you

206
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,160
those Pandavas have come up
with this contraption.

207
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,320
If I extinguish

208
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,520
any one of the lamps
this instant

209
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,760
then, will
one of my brothers die?

210
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
Then here you go,
mother.

211
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,120
If the first lamp

212
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,480
represents my life

213
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,800
then I shall extinguish it
this instant.

214
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,360
It did not get extinguished,
did it?

215
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,480
These lamps will be extinguished
only in the battlefield, son.

216
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,080
Son, I called you here
only to let you know about it.

217
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,200
Quit the thought of a battle

218
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,920
and apologize to Draupadi.

219
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,440
Return them
their property, son.

220
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,440
Please save yourselves.
- Impossible, mother.

221
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,400
Impossible.

222
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,120
Man's life does not hold
more value than his pride.

223
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,000
The Pandavas had insulted me
in the court of Indraprastha.

224
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
My revenge

225
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,360
will be complete only with
the death of those Pandavas!

226
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,640
Son...

227
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
Son Duryodhan

228
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,960
just think once about
the situation your father is in.

229
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,360
His heart
is exceedingly agitated.

230
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,800
The uncertainties of the future

231
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,480
keep him awake all night.

232
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,440
Duryodhan

233
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,080
just look at the sadness
of your mother.

234
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,800
A mother who loses her sons

235
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,040
experiences the agony
of the bite

236
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
of a hundred serpents.

237
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,440
Her life becomes hell.

238
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
Even death does not embrace her.

239
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,120
Then tell Queen Mother Kunti

240
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,240
to be prepared
to experience such agony

241
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,800
because the ones to die
in the battlefield

242
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,040
will be the Pandavas!

243
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,360
They will die at my hands.

244
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,960
Mother

245
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,720
do not let such illusory lamps

246
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,320
scare you.

247
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,800
I do not believe
in these things.

248
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,280
If lighting and
extinguishing such lamps

249
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,520
could affect the life

250
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,000
and death of man

251
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,160
then all the people

252
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,920
who make lamps in this world

253
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,840
would be made to sit
in a temple.

254
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,120
In this war

255
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I will emerge victorious.

256
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,680
I shall become the Emperor
of this land!
