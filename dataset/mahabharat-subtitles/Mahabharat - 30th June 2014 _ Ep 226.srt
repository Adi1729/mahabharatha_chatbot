1
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,580
'Sons of Pandu, my blessings 
are with you!'

2
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,570
'Establish justice.'

3
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,450
'Slay me!'

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,680
'May you be victorious!'

5
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,680
Liberate your Grandsire, Arjun!

6
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,630
Put an end to his troubles!

7
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,690
"It is your duty that you all
engage in the battle with honesty!"

8
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,400
"If you have to make
any sacrifice"

9
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,690
"do so, with a smile on your faces."

10
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,600
"Therefore, slaying me
is your duty."

11
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,540
"If any of you step back
from this duty of yours"

12
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,670
"it shall break my heart!"

13
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,650
"You must abide this order 
of your Grandsire!"

14
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,450
"Even though your hearts quiver"

15
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,520
"while slaying me"

16
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,690
"your hands should not,
my lads!"

17
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,630
Grant me redemption, Arjun!

18
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,580
Redemption!

19
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,400
"Your family shall punish you!"

20
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,430
"All the sins committed by you"

21
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,440
"shall pierce your body like arrows,
Bheeshma!"

22
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,670
"You shall writhe in agony
lying in an array of arrows!"

23
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,670
"And at that moment I shall
be present there!"

24
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,170
What have we done, Grandsire Bheeshma?

25
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,300
What sin have I committed?

26
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,210
What twist of fate is this?

27
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,220
What twist of fate is this?
That I...

28
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,320
...That I was compelled to raise 
my arms against you?

29
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,200
Grandsire!

30
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,110
Today... Today I have opened
the gates of hell for myself!

31
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,190
I have betrayed my ancestors!

32
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,160
I have tainted my race!

33
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,360
And...

34
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,260
And I have strangled 
my morals, Grandsire!

35
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,210
Why... Why didn't my arms break
before doing this?

36
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,290
Why didn't my arms break?

37
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,190
Why didn't my eyes lose 
their sight, Grandsire?

38
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,290
Arjun, my lad!
I am alright!

39
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,140
You have only abided

40
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,180
by my orders!

41
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,350
The lamp that burns
after sunrise...

42
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,290
does not generate illumination.

43
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,290
That lamp...

44
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,320
only creates soot.

45
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,170
The burning of such a lamp
is futile!

46
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,210
No, Grandsire!

47
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,240
It is better to extinguish
that lamp!

48
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,370
No, Grandsire!

49
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,160
Arjun, my lad!
That lamp...

50
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,290
cannot extinguish itself.

51
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,230
And this favour which seems harsh,

52
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,260
has to be committed by someone else.

53
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,110
Even my life...

54
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,310
is futile now, my lad!

55
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,290
It is futile.

56
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,360
No, grandsire.

57
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,320
Your life is not futile.

58
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,330
I am in need of your guidance,
grandsire!

59
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,300
We all are in need of your guidance!

60
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,300
Justice is the path for everyone.

61
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,080
And one's mind is his guide.

62
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,090
Anyone can give you advice...
my lad. But...

63
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,320
No one can offer you guidance.

64
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,180
You all are capable of knowing
the path of truth.

65
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,210
Now do not mourn, my lads!

66
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,350
Do not mourn!

67
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
But, Grandsire.

68
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,130
As long as you are alive...
Our childhood shall be alive in our hearts!

69
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,270
After your demise
our laughter shall fade.

70
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,310
Worldly worries shall torment
our hearts, grandsire!

71
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,220
It is our selfishness

72
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:32,170
That we cannot let you die!
That we cannot let you die, Grandsire!

73
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,200
Our divine medicines,

74
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,110
can heal all of grandsire's
wound before dawn, borther!

75
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,210
Let's take grandsire
to our encampment!

76
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,180
Nakul, my lad!
Do not bind me now!

77
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,250
But, Grandsire. All your oaths
are fulfilled now!

78
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,380
You even laid down your weapons yourself!

79
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,160
Now there are no restraints upon you!

80
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,290
Then why are you adamant,
upon giving up your life?

81
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,260
Because you are adamant upon saving me, Arjun.

82
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,330
Your adamancy shall become
my restraint.

83
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,330
Lord Shri Krishna.

84
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,240
Opened my eyes in a moment!

85
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,310
Seek his guidance, Arjun!

86
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,150
All your restraints shall be undone.

87
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,150
This isn't desire,
Grandsire!

88
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,290
This is love.

89
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,230
Desire tries to restrain others!

90
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,140
And love...

91
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,270
Love binds itself to others.

92
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,150
Even saints have the
right to love, Grandsire!

93
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,190
All your life you have suffered.

94
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,320
The agony of restraints!

95
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,260
Now you have the chance.

96
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,230
To stay alive and enjoy liberty!

97
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,310
No, Krishna!

98
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,250
As long as I was alive I
never let injustice happen.

99
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,120
And justice as well.

100
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,380
I had hindered justice.

101
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,220
And injustice too!

102
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,200
In reality,

103
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,330
I had stubbornly,

104
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,130
halted the progress of time.

105
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,340
Therefore,

106
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,370
I never let time performs its function.

107
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,760
So you killed him!

108
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,890
You killed my Grandsire,
woeful Arjun!

109
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,930
Is this your justice?

110
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,950
Even the one who cuts a
tree is called a criminal!

111
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,920
But you severed the very roots 
of my family.

112
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,900
Yudhishtir, you are brute!

113
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,770
Are you so greedy to 
acquire the throne?

114
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,770
Brother Duryodhan!

115
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,010
This is time to bid
Grandsire a final farewell.

116
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,920
I can bid my Grandsire

117
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,980
a final farewell in just one way!

118
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,000
I shall lay your severed
head at my Grandsire's feet!

119
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,730
Duryodhan!

120
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,900
The sun has set! 
You cannot attack now!

121
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,880
Yes!
The sun has set!

122
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,750
The sun has set upon the 
Kuru clan, Bheem!

123
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,920
And this has happened due
to this vile Arjun!

124
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,890
I shall end your life right now, Arjun!

125
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,040
If there is even an inkling
of justice left in your heart.

126
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,870
Then accept the punishment for this crime!

127
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,750
Arjun!
