1
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,190
That sounded like the scream
of your eldest brother, My Lord.

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,950
That is impossible.

3
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,090
What danger can befall him while
performing the 'Sandhyavandana?'

4
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,130
Maybe a crocodile bit him

5
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,990
or maybe a Yaksha or an ogre
has captured him.

6
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,090
Please go and have
a look, My Lord.

7
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,120
I cannot leave you here
and go, Panchali.

8
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,930
That is the second time he has
screamed for help, My Lord.

9
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,980
Please go and have a look!

10
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,930
You will return soon anyhow.

11
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,150
What can happen in the meantime?

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,990
Please go,
My Lord!

13
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,050
But Panchali

14
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,860
today is the last day
of our exile.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,090
Duryodhan must certainly
be up to no good.

16
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,120
That is what we fear.

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,060
He must have attacked

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,020
My Lord Yudhishthir
finding him by himself.

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,990
Please go and have
a look, My Lord!

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Until My Lords Bheem
and Sahadev return

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,090
I shall protect myself
with this sword, My Lord.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,920
Please go and have a look.

23
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,860
Daughter of Drupad...

24
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,790
Who are you

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,960
and why have you come
to my residence?

26
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,030
Me?

27
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,920
I am King Jayadrath of Sindhu

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,020
and Dushala's husband.

29
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,020
King of Sindhu!

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,890
Greetings!

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Welcome!

32
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,790
Pardon me...
- What?

33
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,860
My Lord Yudhishthir has gone
to perform the 'Sandhyavandana.'

34
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,920
I know that.

35
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,780
I

36
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,890
saw everything
while hiding there

37
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,830
and the moment he left

38
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,730
I came here.

39
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,720
Brother Yudhishthir!

40
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,660
Brother Yudhishthir!

41
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,690
Brother Yudhishthir!

42
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,950
Brother Yudhishthir!

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,690
Nakul! What are you
doing here?

44
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,850
I heard your scream.

45
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,950
You were screaming for help.

46
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,860
I was performing 'pranayam'* under the water.
*Extension of the praṇa or breath.

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,860
This is certainly a part
of a wicked plan, brother.

48
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
Panchali...

49
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,690
Panchali is by herself
in the hut, brother Yudhishthir!

50
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,820
Let's go there immediately!

51
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,690
What is this villainy,
King of Sindhu?!

52
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,660
I have come to take you away.

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,900
You have already
served five husbands.

54
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,660
Now,
how about

55
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,830
you serve me for a while?

56
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,790
Let me go,
wicked man!

57
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Let's go!
- Let go!

58
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,820
Brother Bheem

59
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,630
I have a feeling that something
bad will happen with Panchali.

60
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,790
We must return
immediately, brother.

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,790
Let go!

62
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,620
My Lord!

63
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,820
My Lord!

64
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,660
My Lord!

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,730
Let go...

66
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,790
My Lord!
- Panchali!

67
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,620
My Lord!
- Panchali!

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,660
Let go.

69
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
My Lord!
- Stop, King of Sindhu!

70
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,590
My Lord!

71
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,650
Panchali!
- My Lord!

72
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,760
Bheem!

73
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,550
It was Dushala's husband,
brother Yudhishthir!

74
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,790
He has abducted Panchali.

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,790
He must certainly be trying
to go to the kingdom of Sindhu.

76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,790
We must stop him
before he crosses the border!

77
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,790
It is not dusk yet,
uncle.

78
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,560
Even the Pandavas have
not yet reached, my darling.

79
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,650
Look over there.

80
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,580
King of Sindhu is on his way.

81
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,490
Do not worry,
my darling.

82
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,690
No one can stop the sun.

83
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,550
Let go!

84
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,490
Let go!

85
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,460
Arjun!
- My darling

86
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,650
none of us can attack him.

87
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,620
If we break our promise

88
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,630
then that old geyser
will not get off our case.

89
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,530
Wait until it is sundown.

90
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,490
No one shall attack
until sundown.

91
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,650
How dare you lay even
a finger on Draupadi

92
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,490
King Jayadrath of Sindhu?!

93
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
How could you even dream

94
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,620
of defeating
the sons of Pandu?!

95
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,590
How could you even think

96
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,660
that your act of trying
to abduct Panchali

97
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,450
would go unpunished by me?!

98
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,430
Here you go!

99
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,390
Here I am!

100
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,430
And when I stand tall
like a wall

101
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,550
Pavan Dev himself
is unable to go through me!

102
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,600
You are a mere mortal!

103
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,430
We cannot attack him,
uncle

104
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,400
but we can certainly
protect our brother-in-law.

105
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,460
Attack!

106
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,290
Stop!

107
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,420
Where is the King of Sindhu?!

108
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,330
Where did Arjun and Draupadi

109
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,450
disappear?!

110
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,520
We must find them before dusk!

111
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,490
Where did the three
of them disappear?

112
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,490
Where did the three
of them disappear?!

113
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,450
King of Sindhu!

114
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,320
You must be aware of
the punishment awarded

115
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,400
to a person who tries to
abduct a married woman!

116
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,260
Pardon me

117
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,420
but we must slay you!

118
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,970
Then you must
also slay Duryodhan.

119
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,000
I did this because
he asked me to.

120
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,070
Does a piece of wood
thrown into the fire

121
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,070
by someone else not burn,
King of Sindhu?!

122
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,090
Bheem!

123
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,000
Kill King of Sindhu!

124
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,030
All of them must certainly
be present in these woods!

125
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,860
Soldiers!

126
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,030
Jayadrath,
I shall crush your head!

127
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,030
Punish him,
My Lord!

128
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,960
Punish him in a way

129
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,030
that whenever any evil man
looks at a woman with depravity

130
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,860
fear should take him over!

131
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,830
No, brother Bheem!

132
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,990
He is Dushala's husband.

133
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,060
We cannot leave
our sister widowed.

134
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,890
Do not take pity on him,
brother Arjun!

135
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,060
Whoever tries to save a scorpion
from drowning in the water

136
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
gets stung by
the scorpion itself.

137
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,920
I hope you know that.

138
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,830
This man will hurt you someday!

139
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,900
We will deal
with it later, Nakul

140
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,960
but

141
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,030
we cannot leave
our sister widowed.

142
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,790
Brother!

143
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,900
I have found the crown
of the King of Sindhu.

144
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
They must certainly have
gone in that direction.

145
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,960
It is almost sundown.

146
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,830
Do what you have to
but with haste.

147
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,830
We must punish him

148
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,800
so that even Duryodhan
learns a lesson!

149
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
Arjun!

150
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,730
Bring your arrow!

151
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,890
I shall shave his head!

152
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,830
These are five tufts of hair,
King of Sindhu!

153
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,900
Show them to Duryodhan and tell
him that even the five Pandavas

154
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,870
will always be present
on his head

155
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
like five lines of tension!

156
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,930
Brothers.

157
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
How could they escape

158
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,320
in just a moment?

159
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,390
How could they just vanish?!

160
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,430
The question is not

161
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,130
how they left.

162
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,200
The question is

163
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,260
where they went.

164
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,290
My darling

165
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,360
before a year is over

166
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,360
we must find the Pandavas.

167
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,290
Please be quiet,
uncle.

168
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,330
Your plan

169
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,360
has failed once again.

170
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,370
My plan has not failed,
my darling.

171
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,290
Good fortune was on
the side of the Pandavas

172
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,150
Yet again.

173
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,360
Fortune!

174
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,130
What is fortune,
uncle?!

175
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,160
Good fortune of the enemies

176
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,290
is merely another term
for our weakness.

177
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,320
Karna was correct.

178
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,100
Treachery can be useful

179
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,150
only in winning a game of dice

180
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,200
and not an empire!

181
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,200
Do not forget,
my darling

182
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,160
that for the past twelve years

183
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,290
the glory of being the Emperor

184
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,260
was not acquired by you
in a battlefield.

185
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,190
Treachery

186
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
and cheating have
gifted you that.

187
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,100
The competence
to fight the Pandavas

188
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,100
does not reside

189
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,320
within you.

190
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,290
I do not have the competence!

191
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,220
Is Bheem more powerful than me?

192
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,060
When compared to
my friend Karna, is Arjun

193
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,290
a better archer,
uncle?

194
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,030
The individual competence

195
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,130
of each one of you

196
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,070
is something I am not aware of.

197
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,220
However,
in a battle

198
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,220
the basis of victory
is not individual might

199
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,120
but the might of the army.

200
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,060
The number of Kings

201
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,020
on your side in a battle

202
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,260
is more important.

203
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,120
The love the subjects
have for you

204
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,190
is more important.

205
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,220
The blossoming
of a single flower

206
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,160
does not denote
the arrival of spring.

207
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,000
When the entire forest
is filled with flowers

208
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,230
it is spring time then.

209
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,130
Similarly

210
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,100
an empire

211
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,960
is formed with the affection

212
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,930
and trust of all the Kings.

213
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,150
Uncle

214
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,190
your words can

215
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,060
no longer be trusted by me.

216
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,170
My heart desires blood now.

217
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,990
I want a war now!

218
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,130
I want a war now.
- You want a war!

219
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,190
You want a war?!

220
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,160
There will be a war!

221
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,990
Before a year is over

222
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,030
if we do not find the Pandavas

223
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,050
if you

224
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,990
do not see any one of them

225
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,990
and call him by his name

226
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,900
and if their life of anonymity

227
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,970
cannot be rendered
worthless by us

228
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,190
then there will be war.
