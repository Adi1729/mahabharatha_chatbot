1
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,310
Mother.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,340
I'm still hungry.

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
Uh!

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,500
But, hadn't I given you
'laddoos'?

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,280
Arjun, Nakul and Sahadev
ate all those 'laddoos'.

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,240
Did they eat all the 'laddoos'?

7
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,430
Not all, but most of them.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,370
They ate four of those
'laddoos'.

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,410
Wait.

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,260
I had kept this 'laddoo'
for Madhavi.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,410
Here. You may have this 'laddoo'
as well.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,240
I don't know why, mother.

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,430
But when you feed me
with your hands

14
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,440
I am satiated instantly.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,240
Because I'm content at heart and
it passes over to your stomach.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,340
And my biggest contentment lies

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,340
in feeding all five of my sons
with my own hands.

18
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,210
Come on. You all better come in
and have your lunch too.

19
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,330
Else, his contentment lasts
only for a few moments. Come.

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,330
Mother!

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,180
'If I marry your father,
I shall only bear misfortune.'

22
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,110
'Your son shall be
your successor as the king.'

23
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,260
'But what shall be the fate
of my sons?'

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,410
'King Shantanu may have just
one of these two pleasures.'

25
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,240
'The pleasure of living in
the royal palace with his son.'

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,170
'Or the pleasure of living with
his wife in this humble home.'

27
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,110
'No, mother.'

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,110
'My father shall have
both these pleasures'

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,140
'at once.'

30
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,180
'I, the son of Ganga,

31
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,340
swear upon
the sanctity of my mother.'

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,170
'I shall spend my life
not as a king'

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,370
'but as a servant
of Hastinapur.'

34
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,200
'I will not have a family
of my won.'

35
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,300
'I swear to a life of celibacy.'

36
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,270
On these banks of yours,
your son had taken an oath.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,270
If only you had
stopped him then.

38
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,140
If you had stopped him then

39
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,330
so many lives wouldn't
have been lost.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,270
Why didn't you stop him?
Why?

41
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Every day, hundreds of humans
come to my banks, Satyavati.

42
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,130
They take various oaths
and make many promises.

43
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,040
If I keep stopping everyone
how will nature work, Satyavati?

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,080
It isn't my duty
to hinder one's oaths.

45
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,200
But Bheeshma is your son,
0' Bhagirathi.*
*One of the two headstreams of the Ganges.

46
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,040
For twenty five years you have
imparted him with morals.

47
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,170
You made him capable
of being a king.

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,080
But when he renounced royalty,
did it not pierce your heart?

49
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,200
Who isn't my son.

50
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,080
Every human who visits my banks
is my son.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,080
And I always impart sanctity
and morals to everyone.

52
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,040
Therefore, isn't Bheeshma
significant to you?

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
He is...

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,040
Bheeshma is significant.

55
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,200
But that significance
lies in his heart.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,100
Not in how I perceive him.

57
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,060
Satyavati.

58
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,170
The bad state that Hastinapur
and the Kuru clan is in today

59
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,200
you are the one solely
responsible for it.

60
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,130
Because your vision has the gift
of foresight, nof mine.

61
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,130
I am a mere moral.

62
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,200
I am not immortal as yourself.

63
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,980
Every moment, the fear of death
torments the human heart.

64
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,070
That is why he seeks protection.

65
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,940
I, too, was just seeking
protection.

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,200
So, did you find protection?

67
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,940
What did you get?
A lifetime of struggle?

68
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,970
And humiliation at this old age?

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
Curses and distrust
of millions of subjects?

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,170
To add sugar or salt to an urn
of water, is your decision.

71
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,940
But once you take a decision it
cannot be reverted, Satyavati.

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,110
I know, 0' Bhagirathi.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,940
It was my fault indeed.

74
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,070
But, I didn't possess the power
of foresight then.

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,040
And a human's life is a
consequence of his deference.

76
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,940
I know.
It was my fault.

77
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,000
But now...

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,030
Now I must strengthen the future
of the Kuru dynasty

79
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,910
and the Kuru empire.

80
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,970
Please suggest a way
to do it, Ganga.

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,070
Please, show me the path.

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,130
You had made the first decision
on your own.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,940
You hadn't sought anyone's
advice.

84
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Now it's time to take
the second decision.

85
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,070
You have to decide by yourself,
Satyavati.

86
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,880
Everyone wants to make decisions
about today, for a bright future

87
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,810
To have a happy and safe future.

88
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,880
To take such decisions today is
what everyone attempts to do.

89
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,040
Consider your life for example.

90
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Aren't most of your decisions
backed by thoughts for future?

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,070
And why shouldn't they be?

92
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,880
Everyone has the right to make

93
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,860
their life simple and happy.

94
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,980
But no one knows the future.

95
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,040
It can only be imagined.

96
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,910
So we make all crucial
decisions of life

97
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,980
based on imagination.

98
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,030
Could there be a third possible

99
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
way to reach a decision?

100
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,870
Think about it.

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,840
The basis of all pleasures
is a sense of duty.

102
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,900
And the sense of duty resides
within the human heart.

103
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,740
So before coming to any decision

104
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,840
do ask your heart the question

105
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,830
whether this decision
is result of selfishness

106
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,000
or out of your sense of duty?

107
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,940
Isn't it reasonable?

108
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,000
So, won't thinking about your
duty instead of the future

109
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,000
make the future
far more joyous?

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,830
Think for yourself.

111
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,030
Salutations, Queen Mother!

112
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,190
Salutations, Queen Mother!

113
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,150
Bless you, son!

114
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,150
Vidur.
Arrange for travel.

115
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,960
I need to leave at dawn's break.

116
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,220
Are you leaving for somewhere?

117
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,090
To fulfill my duties, Bheeshma.

118
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,220
I should have done it years ago.

119
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,060
But then, my selfishness

120
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,960
hindered me from
being aware of my duties.

121
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,090
Fortunately, it didn't hinder me
my entire life.

122
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,900
But now, I must bring about
a change of circumstances.

123
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,190
What do you mean, Queen Mother?

124
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
Vidur.

125
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,160
It was my duty to pay
a wise son as yourself

126
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,190
the respect you truly deserve.

127
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,890
But I never did so.

128
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,130
I always perceived your advice
as inappropriate.

129
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,890
But today...

130
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,930
Today I have realized
my mistake, Vidur.

131
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,130
Hence I...

132
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,890
I am here to take you along,
on my journey.

133
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,900
The two of us shall go to Pandu.

134
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,990
I shall reason with him...
Convince him.

135
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,860
I shall remind him
of his duties.

136
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,090
And at any cost,
I shall bring Pandu back

137
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,120
to manage the throne
of Hastinapur.

138
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,930
Welcome, Your Highness.

139
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
What ritual have you organized,
elder brother?

140
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,860
It is to take a pledge,
dear Gandhari.

141
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,960
Have a seat.
- No, brother.

142
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,060
Until I don't know the outcome
of this ritual

143
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,100
I shall not participate
in the ritual.

144
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,800
Dear Gandhari.
Your elder brother's heart

145
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,800
wishes for nothing but joy
for you and your family.

146
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Don't you trust your brother?

147
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,830
My family doesn't end at just
my husband and my children.

148
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,020
The descendants of
king Shantanu are my family.

149
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
Uh!

150
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,920
Then it is a dispute between you
and your spouse.

151
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,990
If instead of Duryodhan,
one of Pandu's sons gets

152
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,000
the throne of Hastinapur
and that's acceptable to you

153
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,990
then you may discuss the matter
with your husband.

154
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,960
Why would that happen, Shakuni?

155
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,000
My successor can be none other
than my son, Duryodhan.

156
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,860
What do you have to say,
Gandhari?

157
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,860
I have faith in Grandsire.

158
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,890
I have faith in Queen Mother
and Vidur as well.

159
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,830
They will see to it that
no injustice is done.

160
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,990
Once, a pond was drying up.

161
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,760
The frogs there had to go
to another pond.

162
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,950
A stork said...

163
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,760
'Trust me. I shall take
you to the other pond'.

164
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,890
'Sit within my beak'.

165
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,760
Did you understand anything,
dear Gandhari?

166
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,760
Those frogs who trusted the
stork didn't reach the pond.

167
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,850
They reached the stork's
intestines instead.

168
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,820
Today, after fifteen years

169
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,890
why did Queen Mother
remember Pandu all of a sudden?

170
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,790
Did you ever give it a thought,
Your Highness?

171
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,660
Indeed!

172
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,890
I have been thinking of the same
since many days now, Shakuni.

173
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,850
If out of affection,
Queen Mother indeed embarked

174
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,930
upon this journey, why did
she take Vidur along?

175
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,790
She has definitely gone there
to help King Pandu

176
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,790
complete his penance,
Your Highness.

177
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,830
Come, Your Highness.
Have a seat.

178
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,620
Let us take a pledge.

179
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,730
What oath do you want us
to take, elder brother?

180
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,690
To break the Kuru dynasty
into pieces?

181
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,690
No, sister.

182
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,660
Why would I want your clan
to be divided?

183
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,860
Why would I violate
His Highness's trust?

184
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,890
All I want is that
His Highness's offspring

185
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,850
be called 'Kaurav'.

186
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,860
The 'Pandavas' should
not be included.

187
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,720
Before the return of
Queen Mother and the minister

188
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,790
Prince Duryodhan should
be declared

189
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,660
the crown prince of Hastinapur.

190
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,590
If my words seem appropriate
then have a seat.

191
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,620
How far can this arrow be shot,
father?

192
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,590
It can be shot all the way
out of this forest.

193
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,600
I can throw it that far
with my hands.

194
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,660
What is the need of a bow
for that?

195
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,700
It's not about throwing it,
brother Bheem.

196
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,690
It's a matter of piercing
the target.

197
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,690
At how far can a target be shot,
father?

198
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,760
The strength of a bow
depends on a man.

199
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,590
It is not the other way around,
son.

200
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,720
A weapon is only as handy
as the wielder's inner strength.

201
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,590
Just as a skill is only as
beneficial as one's will power.

202
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,790
I do not understand, father.
What is will power?

203
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,550
When the wind blows at a high
speed, it can uproot trees.

204
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,730
The tree that get uprooted,
becomes firewood.

205
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,530
But the tree that stands firm,
blooms new leaves and flowers

206
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,780
after a certain time.

207
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,530
And that is termed as
the will power of the tree.

208
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,790
Even when the odds are
against him

209
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,790
a human should not abandon
his duties, son.

210
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,650
And what is inner strength?

211
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,690
When pests and termites
from beneath the ground

212
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,530
start biting and devouring
a tree, some trees die.

213
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,690
But there are some trees,
that the pests cannot devour.

214
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,760
That is the tree's
inner strength.

215
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,630
When evil afflicts
the human heart

216
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,590
and tries to consume it
from within

217
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,660
then he should not give in
to the affliction within.

218
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,630
That means, will power protects
against unfavourable

219
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,680
circumstances outside.

220
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,560
And against the inner conflicts,
inner strength protects us.

221
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,750
Brilliant, my son.
I am proud of you.

222
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,760
Some day you shall be the most
deserving king of Hastinapur.

223
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,930
Queen Mother.

224
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,980
Arrangements for your meals
and rest have been made here.

225
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,880
And your seat has been arranged
upon that river bank.

226
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,810
I have no need for rest, Vidur.

227
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,940
But the soldiers and
the horsemen need to rest.

228
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,030
For many years

229
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,910
I have lived
in the comfort of the palace.

230
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,880
But not even for a single moment
did I feel rested at all.

231
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,040
Maybe, as my mind keeps working,
my body gets tired too.

232
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,800
But today...

233
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,870
Today, it is as if
this single right decision

234
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,940
erased all traces of tiredness
and pain within my body.

235
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,740
You had enthroned King Pandu
even before this, Queen Mother.

236
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,870
But it was a twist of fate...
- No, Vidur!

237
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,740
It isn't the fault of fate.

238
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,000
If my decisions were
inappropriate

239
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,840
I could have forgiven myself.

240
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,000
But the reasons behind
my decisions

241
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,910
were always inappropriate.

242
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,910
There was affection
within my mind.

243
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,740
But I had restrained that
affection out of selfishness.

244
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,810
Do you see that river, Vidur?

245
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,810
It flows between the banks...

246
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,770
But its water...

247
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,710
But its water goes underground

248
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,970
and reaches far, to those
trees within that forest.

249
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,780
A Queen Mother's life is
somewhat similar, Vidur.

250
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,770
She lives with her family.

251
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,910
But if her affection and respect
does not reach across the nation

252
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,710
then her life is futile.

253
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,870
Her reign is incompetent.

254
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,710
So, will brother Pandu heed
your words, Queen Mother?

255
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,830
Will he abandon his penance?

256
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,930
He will heed.

257
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,780
Pandu will surely heed my words.

258
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,930
I shall convince him.

259
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,650
This nature,
the flowers bloomed in spring

260
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,900
these leaves, the bark of trees,
the excitement of the birds...

261
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,900
I shall show him all of it.

262
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,670
I shall tell him

263
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,830
that if we wish such a spring to
bloom within our subjects' lives

264
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,810
he must give up his oath.

265
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,760
And Vidur...

266
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,840
In the spring, even Lord Shiva's
penance was broken for a moment.

267
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,840
Pandu's penance shall be
surely broken too.

268
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,630
Mother!
Mother!

269
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,570
Sahadev!
What happened, son?

270
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,700
I don't know why, mother.
But my heart is quivering.

271
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,540
Surely some mishap has occurred
with father.
