1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,480
Make an announcement
in the entire Kuru kingdom

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,510
that King Pandu has won
Kunti's hand in the 'swayamvar'.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,580
All hail!
- King Pandu!

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,550
All hail!
- King Pandu!

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,720
All hail!
- King Pandu!

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,650
All hail!
- King Pandu!

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,500
Prince, I have
brought you your meal.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,540
Okay.
Set it down.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,640
The taste...

10
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,610
It's a bit different today.

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,590
It has been prepared in the
Gandhar's culinary style, sire.

12
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,590
Gandhari wished

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,710
you to be introduced to
the taste of Gandhar's cuisine.

14
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,530
She herself...
- If you didn't like it

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,540
I will get another meal
ready in no time.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,530
No!

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,460
The taste of
Gandhar's cuisine is good.

18
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,480
It's different but it's good.

19
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,620
Won't you take a seat?

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,610
So finally the dishes of
Gandhar did make

21
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,590
their way into Hastinapur's
royal kitchen.

22
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,690
It's my first try, Prince.

23
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,650
I must say,
it's quite a good one.

24
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,500
But it won't be famous
in Hastinapur.

25
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,440
Henceforth

26
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,630
the procedures of
Kunti province will be followed.

27
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,590
If the platter has a variety
of tastes

28
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,680
the joy of having food
increases, Prince.

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,640
If the tastes of here, Gandhar
and Kunti province join

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,490
what harm can it pose?

31
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,590
Don't try to preach to me!

32
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,600
You don't have the right
to offer me counsel.

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,690
I'm just trying to ease your
agitated heart, Prince.

34
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,610
I understand that you
are still disturbed.

35
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,660
But, Prince, the pillar
of a temple is as pious

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
as the stoup it holds.

37
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,560
As a matter of fact, the stoup
can't be without a pillar.

38
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,560
The one who was born
to be considered the'stoup'

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,620
could never be
the supporting 'pillar'.

40
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,560
And the 'pillar' meant
for support

41
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,600
wouldn't suit if it were
glorified to be the'stoup'.

42
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,560
Which stone has been
made for either of them

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,590
is something only the architect
knows best about.

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,480
We should accept the decision
of the Almighty, Prince.

45
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,650
This is the time to forego
of all bitterness

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,750
and welcome Pandu and Kunti.
- Don't touch me!

47
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,620
I haven't yet given you
the right to do so!

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,710
Every time...

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,450
Every time I try to
consider you as my wife

50
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,540
this very behaviour of yours
makes me feel

51
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,530
as to how much
my insult...

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,730
Gladdens you.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,670
How very much are
you at peace by the same!

54
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,570
Remember, Gandhari

55
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,470
Pandu's welcome
will neither be done by me

56
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,480
nor by you.

57
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,650
I am your husband.

58
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,480
My orders define your
rules of conduct.

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Now whether you abide by
the same or not

60
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,500
is a choice I leave to you.

61
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,710
Two persons

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,540
on coming closer

63
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,530
try to form boundaries and rules
for the other for sure.

64
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,640
If we ponder over every
relationship, we'd notice

65
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,520
that the source of all of them

66
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,530
are the very boundaries
that we draw for others.

67
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,560
And even if unknowingly,
a stranger oversteps the bounds

68
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,620
the very instant

69
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,510
our heart palpitates with anger.

70
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,580
What's the actual form of
these boundaries?

71
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,550
Have we ever given
it a thought?

72
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,540
By imposing boundaries

73
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,670
we don't allow the other
to decide for himself.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,640
We impose our decision
on the other.

75
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,720
In other words, we reject
the independence of another.

76
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,590
And when independence
is rejected, his heart

77
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,560
is filled with sorrow.

78
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,610
And when he breaks
all the boundaries

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,730
our heart is filled with wrath.

80
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,570
Isn't that how it always
happens?

81
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,520
But if everyone respects
the independence of another

82
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,510
boundaries and rules
become extinct.

83
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,570
In other words

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,650
just like agreement is
the body of a relationship

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,600
isn't independence the soul
of a relationship?

86
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,700
Think over it.

87
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,600
No, dear.

88
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,610
Son-in-law

89
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,670
the first to be offered respect

90
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,720
is the King of the Yadavas
Shoorsen.

91
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,610
He is the one who
sired Kunti.

92
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,500
No!

93
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,750
Greater than the father

94
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,720
is the one who
brings up the child.

95
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,720
You are so right, sire.

96
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,670
The one who forsook one's
child after its birth

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
can never be the first
to be offered respect.

98
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,680
Your right will always
come second.

99
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,650
You may please proceed.

100
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,480
Please come.

101
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,560
Did you hear that, Priyamvada?

102
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,490
So generous and broad
is the outlook of my husband!

103
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,730
By selecting such a husband

104
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,740
I have made myself fortunate!
- Yes, Princess.

105
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,700
But now you must do
no such thing

106
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,710
that robs you of your fortune.

107
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,690
But I can't deceive my husband.

108
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,490
If in order to gain something
one has to lie

109
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,720
that's deception

110
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,430
but in order to shield oneself
from harm, if truth is concealed

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,570
it's not termed
a deception, Princess.

112
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,710
Don't try to weave
a web of words, Priyamvada.

113
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,510
The truths of the world

114
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,550
are but hazy at best
to palace dwellers

115
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,560
but do remember

116
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
that if the same truths
pass into the hands of a foe

117
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,610
they become but
trebuchets.

118
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,460
What...
What are you doing?

119
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,700
This is a shield, Princess.

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,450
To safeguard your
and King Pandu's happy life

121
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,540
from the attacks
of any vile person.

122
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,560
Till the time this thread
is tied around your wrist

123
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,490
you won't say a thing

124
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,610
about your past to your husband.

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,950
What are you doing?
- This is a shield, Princess.

126
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,790
To safeguard your
and King Pandu's happy life

127
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,920
from the attacks
of any vile person.

128
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,860
Till the time this thread
is tied around your wrist

129
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,830
you won't say a thing

130
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,950
about your past to your husband.

131
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,870
But... - There's no time
for options, Princess.

132
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,730
A king has many wives.

133
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,780
If King Pandu marries
a second time

134
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,900
this very secret of yours
will become a risk to your life.

135
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,950
And anyway

136
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,860
a secret portends
a danger to a woman.

137
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,810
Why...

138
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,860
Why do I get the feeling

139
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,930
that by tying this thread

140
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,760
you have but curtailed
my breaths.

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,840
If I keep this matter
a secret from my husband

142
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,870
then it would be
my second crime.

143
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,810
Moreover

144
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,890
after having forsaken my son

145
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,900
I have committed a crime.

146
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,810
God knows

147
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,910
who would have raised my son.

148
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,050
Whose family would have
served as his refuge.

149
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,020
Would he...

150
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,930
Would he have ever received
maternal love?

151
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,960
Or just as an orphan

152
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,880
is he destined to
suffer pangs of sorrow.

153
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,850
Where could my son be?

154
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,910
Where could be...
My Karna!

155
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,890
Help!

156
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,820
Someone, help me!

157
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,960
Hey! Look! Move away!
- Help!

158
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,030
What's going on?
- Help!

159
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,010
Run for your lives!
- Someone save him!

160
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,980
Someone save him!

161
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,810
Save him!

162
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,750
Move back!

163
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,760
Move back!
- Step back! - Save him!

164
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,950
What's going on!
Someone save him!

165
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,760
Move!

166
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,950
Son!

167
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,020
Karna!

168
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes?

169
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,920
Radha, your son
is indeed divine.

170
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,910
Mother, I just...

171
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,820
Mother?
Mother!

172
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,840
Mother!
- Shut up, idiot!

173
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,800
First you infuriate me
and then chant my name!

174
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,000
Come home and I'll
take you to task!

175
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,830
But why, mother?
What did I do?

176
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,990
I was just saving the kid.

177
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,910
And what about you?
Would the Lord save you?

178
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,780
Why don't you think before
doing anything?

179
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,820
But I don't require
any protection, mother.

180
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,970
You know that already.
- Shut up and come home!

181
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,980
Come on!

182
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,830
Come home and I'll
take you to task!

183
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,990
Come on home!

184
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,860
Mother!

185
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,030
Are you angry, mother?

186
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,830
Son, you first infuriate me

187
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,810
and then very coyly ask
if I am angry.

188
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,810
Why do you do any such deed
that makes me angry?

189
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,010
I'm Adhirath's son.

190
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,950
I will have to save
the child, right?

191
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,810
I know that.

192
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,940
But I have to save you from
your father's temper, right?

193
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,960
And after the deed you've
done today

194
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,890
deems your punishment necessary.

195
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,000
Father had gone to the Kunti
province with the King, right?

196
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,930
But now he's
on his way back.

197
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,950
Son, the King is coming
back with his Queen

198
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,770
and we have to pay them a visit.

199
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,740
Does that mean they will
actually see us?

200
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,940
But why would they see us, son?

201
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,830
Neither are we any criminal
nor any valorous warrior.

202
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,800
Mother, haven't you
always said that

203
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,840
being graced with the King's
attention is good fortune?

204
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,030
Or even great misfortune.

205
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,830
Son, attention from
great people

206
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,770
always has a profound effect.

207
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,880
Then we should be graced
with Their Highness' attention.

208
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,760
But how?

209
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,890
All hail!
- King Pandu!

210
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,790
All hail!
- King Pandu!

211
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,720
All hail!
- King Pandu!

212
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,930
'This is a shield, Princess.'

213
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,740
'To safeguard your
and King Pandu's happy life'

214
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,900
'from the attacks
of any vile person.'

215
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,780
'Till the time this thread
is tied around your wrist'

216
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,930
'you won't say a thing about
your past to your husband.'

217
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,670
All hail!
- King Pandu!

218
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,920
All hail!
- King Pandu!

219
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,840
All hail!
- King Pandu!

220
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,660
Why did you stop, Adhirath?

221
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,820
The Chief Minister is coming
to welcome you, Your Highness.

222
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,810
Greetings!
- Greetings, younger brother!

223
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,860
Greetings!
- Greetings!

224
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,840
His and Her Highness
are welcome.

225
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,700
Your Highness, Mother Queen
has ordered

226
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,950
that you should first pay
a visit to the district deity.

227
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,910
Won't you welcome your brother
and sister-in-law, Vidur?

228
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,710
I would welcome
sister-in-law

229
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,780
by being her charioteer.

230
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Adhirath, if you may,
please proceed to your home.

231
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,870
Please take some rest.

232
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,720
My lord!
My lord!

233
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,970
Radha, how are you?
Where is Karna?

234
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,900
He is busy preparing for
the King and Queen's welcome

235
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,780
so that Their Highness
be pleased.

236
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,880
What are you saying?
Why didn't you stop him?

237
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,850
My lord, how could I stop
him from welcoming the King?

238
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,880
God knows what kind
of welcome he would arrange!

239
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,870
He won't use a bow
and arrows, right?

240
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,930
You just don't understand
the gravity of any situation!

241
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,940
Now I have to stop him!

242
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,810
Where is he?

243
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,780
Lord Surya

244
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,680
I don't know of any mantra

245
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,960
but please bless my arrows
with the speed of light.

246
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,950
May no one be harmed by these.

247
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,840
'These are
the very same flowers'

248
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,680
'in whose golden colour reside
the light of Lord Surya and'

249
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,860
'countless memories of mine.'

250
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Vidur, who showered
these flowers?

251
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,750
Such an amazing display
of archery!

252
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,800
Who did this?

253
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,810
This archer has
really pleased me!

254
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,710
Who is this archer?

255
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,860
Come forth!

256
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,860
You deserve the thanks
of mine and the Queen!

257
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,680
Come forth!
