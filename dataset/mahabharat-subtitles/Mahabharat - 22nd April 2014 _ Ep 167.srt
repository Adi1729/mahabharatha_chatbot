1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,090
Despite being the Empress
of the vast Aryan region

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,110
Panchali is working as a maid.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,150
This breaks my heart,
brother Yudhishthir.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,350
Nakul, working as a maid
would have left one sorrowful

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,150
had one deemed oneself a slave

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,090
and Panchali can
never deem herself one.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,190
Our life of anonymity
is almost over.

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,280
Just fifteen more days

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,250
and all of us will be free.

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,190
I can almost feel our freedom.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,050
A person facing East

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,280
can see the sunlight

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,280
even before sunrise.

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,290
Panchali

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,150
why are your apparels torn?

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,180
I have left a piece
of my apparel

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,190
with another wicked man

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,990
so that I do not forget him

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,090
when it is time to punish him.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,020
Kichak!

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,090
Did he misbehave
with you again today?!

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,220
I shall crush
his head this instant!

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,220
Not now,
My Lord.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,250
Just like Jarasandha

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,180
very few people can slay Kichak.

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,020
Everyone knows about this.

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,090
If the news
of Kichak's death spreads

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,060
then Duryodhan will know that
we are in the city of Virat.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,950
Panchali is correct.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,110
We need to stay anonymous
only for fifteen more days.

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,960
Hear all!
The Prince of Kuru

32
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,990
the son of Emperor Dhritarashtra

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,180
Crown Prince Duryodhan
is making his entrance!

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,020
Welcome,
King of Gandhar.

35
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,950
Welcome,
Crown Prince.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,990
I welcome all of you
to the city of Virat.

37
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,980
King Virat, may there be
appreciation in your prosperity

38
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
and might.

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,020
Do accept my
sincerest greetings.

40
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,920
Do be seated.

41
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,160
What brings you here,
King of Gandhar?

42
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,080
In the last 500 years,
the royalty of Gandhar

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,090
and Hastinapur visiting
the kingdom of Matsya

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,080
is something
I have not heard of.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,110
That is completely untrue,
King Virat.

46
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,020
That is a false accusation.

47
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,880
The royalty of Hastinapur

48
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,960
has certainly been
to the Matsya kingdom

49
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,890
and the city of Virat
has also been

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,110
a home to it.

51
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,120
When?

52
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,050
A year ago.

53
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,140
For the past one year

54
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,080
the five sons of King Pandu

55
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,880
and their wife

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,080
have been in your refuge.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,850
I have given refuge to no one,
King of Gandhar.

58
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,850
King Virat

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,880
the sons of Pandu are
offenders of Hastinapur.

60
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,980
If you try to keep them hidden

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,080
then you must face
the army of Hastinapur

62
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,090
in a battle.

63
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,020
I fear no one,
Crown Prince.

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,110
You are welcome to command
your army to my kingdom.

65
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,780
Your Highness

66
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,850
there is no need for a battle.

67
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,980
Crown Prince

68
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,980
had we known
where the Pandavas are

69
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,790
we would have
brought them to you.

70
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,920
The wife of the Pandavas

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,020
has beauty that can

72
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,850
be surpassed by no other.

73
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,980
If an exceedingly
beautiful woman

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,050
has been living in your city
for the past one year

75
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,880
then bring her to the court

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,820
General Kichak!

77
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,920
'My husband has taken
the vow to put an end'

78
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,020
'to all the evil-doers
of this world.'

79
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,910
'I am protected by
five mighty Gandharvas.'

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,910
This is not the court
of Hastinapur, Prince Dusshasan

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,910
where women are dragged into!

82
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
This is the court of King Virat

83
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,960
where such lowly behaviour
is not permitted.

84
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,910
King Virat!

85
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,720
Stay within your limits!

86
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,750
Do not cross them!

87
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,810
Your Highness

88
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,790
I think

89
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,920
we have no reason to be an enemy
to the kingdom of Kuru.

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Crown Prince

91
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,880
in the past one year, whoever
migrated to the city of Virat

92
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,890
shall have to walk in this
very court and show himself.

93
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,680
Until then,
do accept

94
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,810
our hospitality tonight.

95
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,720
But King Virat seems to have

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,720
a different opinion

97
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,750
General.

98
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,650
In the kingdom of Matsya

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,880
the General and the King do not
have different opinions, Prince.

100
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,790
My decision

101
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,690
is that of His Highness.

102
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,690
Do not worry,
Prince.

103
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,880
Tomorrow at dawn

104
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,850
all the guests and immigrants

105
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,650
shall be present in this court.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Soldiers

107
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,710
order all the immigrants to be
here in the court tomorrow.

108
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,720
What kind of an order is this,
brother Yudhishthir?

109
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,620
We need to be present in the
court at dawn to show ourselves.

110
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,810
King Shakuni

111
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,660
was given a promise
by General Kichak

112
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
that he would help him
look for us.

113
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,650
Can Duryodhan
and the King of Gandhar

114
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,740
recognize us
despite our disguise?

115
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,720
An onlooker merely sees
an unfamiliar shape, Nakul.

116
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,550
However, a keen eye always finds
what it is looking for.

117
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,650
Had they casually met us

118
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,710
they would never
have recognized us

119
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,710
but they will indeed recognize
us in this display of people.

120
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,720
If Kichak has made a promise
with such great faith

121
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,590
then he must have discovered
Panchali's true identity.

122
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,590
If that is the case

123
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,680
then why did he not disclose
her identity in the court?

124
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,660
I know of his
nefarious intentions.

125
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,650
If he has discovered
Panchali's true identity

126
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,750
then that wicked man will
try to take advantage of it!

127
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,660
Empress Draupadi,
do accept

128
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,650
my greetings.

129
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,550
I know

130
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,510
who you truly are, Sairandhri.*
*"Female attendant employed in royal female apartments."

131
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,490
You are leading
a life of anonymity

132
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,590
and the five Gandharvas
who protect you

133
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,650
are truly the five Pandavas.

134
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,550
I also know about this.

135
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,520
However,
you do not know

136
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,680
that the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur

137
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,510
has reached this kingdom

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,680
in search of all of you.

139
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,590
If he discovers
your true identity

140
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,460
then you will have to go
on an exile for twelve years

141
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,550
Yet again.

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,620
Now, only I
can protect you

143
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,550
Draupadi.

144
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,870
Come to my chamber tonight.

145
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,840
I shall think of the ways

146
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,780
to protect you.

147
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,680
Do you understand,
Draupadi?

148
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,870
You are married to five men.

149
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,840
Another husband

150
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,870
should not bother you.

151
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,680
Tomorrow at dawn

152
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,700
if you

153
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680
and your five husbands

154
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,710
are not compelled
to be at the court by me

155
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,750
then Duryodhan will indeed not
discover your true identities.

156
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,780
I hope you understand

157
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,640
Draupadi.

158
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,800
One more thing.

159
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,580
Do bring some wine with you when
you come to my chamber tonight

160
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,570
Draupadi.

161
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,670
This is an impossible
situation, My Lords.

162
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,780
If I accept
Kichak's indecent proposal

163
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,670
then I shall have to
embrace death.

164
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,700
If I do not accept it

165
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,600
then all of us will have to

166
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,770
go on an exile
for another twelve years

167
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,740
and an additional year
leading a life of anonymity.

168
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,570
Then we shall kill Kichak
and flee from the city.

169
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,510
Yes!

170
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,570
It is merely a matter
of fifteen days.

171
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,510
Our life of anonymity
is almost over.

172
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,540
Can we not hide in the woods
for the remaining days, brother?

173
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,550
We cannot run,
Sahadev.

174
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,440
If we are not present
in the court tomorrow

175
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,580
then everyone will indeed
discover our identities.

176
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,670
Duryodhan will attack King Virat

177
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,640
and King Virat has
given us refuge, Sahadev.

178
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,710
This city has been our home
for the past one year.

179
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,540
Protecting it
is our responsibility.

180
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,540
We cannot let our life of
anonymity go in vain, brother.

181
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,500
It is almost time for the war.

182
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,650
I am eager to crush the heads
of Duryodhan and his brothers!

183
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,600
A delay of another
thirteen years

184
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,570
is intolerable to me.

185
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,670
We must look for another way.

186
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,510
We can find a way out,
brother Bheem

187
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,610
if we ask ourselves
the correct questions.

188
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,610
Does Kichak wish
to have only Panchali

189
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
or by helping Duryodhan

190
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,510
is there an additional
motive in his mind?

191
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,440
So,
do you

192
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,450
wish to acquire the throne
of the Matsya kingdom

193
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,380
Kichak?

194
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,570
Indeed.

195
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,640
Virat is weak.

196
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,580
I am the true King.

197
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,540
However, I can
ascend the throne

198
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,480
only when King Virat

199
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,380
and his son Uttar

200
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,600
get killed in a battle.

201
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,570
If I kill him myself

202
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,510
then the subjects
of the Matsya kingdom

203
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,380
will never accept me.

204
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,600
In other words

205
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,570
you must attack
the Matsya kingdom

206
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,410
slay Virat and his son

207
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,440
in the battle

208
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,570
and make me the new King.

209
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,470
If you promise me this

210
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,340
then I shall bring

211
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,470
your offenders to you.

212
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,300
We accept it,
Kichak.

213
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,240
We give our word to make you

214
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
the new King.

215
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,040
You can now have a peaceful rest

216
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,270
and await dawn.

217
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,130
There is another ambition

218
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,230
I must fulfill

219
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,010
before dawn.

220
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,040
Kichak must certainly

221
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,140
be plotting
to dethrone King Virat

222
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,200
and I am certain

223
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,240
that his nefarious schemes

224
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,010
are not hidden from the King.

225
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,060
Even if that is true

226
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,970
it still does not help
our case, brother Arjun.

227
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,010
Our life of anonymity
will certainly go in vain.

228
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,100
You are correct,
Sahadev.

229
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,080
However, for eyeing
Panchali lewdly

230
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,210
Kichak needs to be punished.

231
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,040
I have a plan with me.

232
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,030
Uncle

233
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,940
are we truly going to

234
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,110
attack the city of Virat?

235
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,130
No, my darling.

236
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,010
That old geyser
will never attack.

237
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,010
Then why was Kichak

238
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,200
promised so by you,
uncle?

239
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,910
In the path to one's ambitions

240
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,930
do you know

241
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,080
what the biggest obstacle is?

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

243
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,170
One's greed.

244
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,940
Greed for women and wine.

245
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,040
Kichak has

246
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,130
greed for Draupadi

247
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,880
otherwise he would never have
asked for time till dawn.

248
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,130
He is foolish.

249
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,940
He does not know

250
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,910
that righteousness dwells

251
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,040
within the Pandavas.

252
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,110
Out of the fear of going on
an exile again, the Pandavas

253
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,970
will not forsake their duties
towards Draupadi

254
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,100
and neither will they
ever do so.

255
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,840
In other words

256
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,900
tonight,
the Pandavas

257
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,840
will slay Kichak.

258
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,810
I am awaiting
the sound

259
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,970
of the duel
between Bheem and Kichak

260
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,070
to reach my ears.

261
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,030
Then we shall leave immediately

262
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,940
and make the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas

263
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,100
go in vain.
