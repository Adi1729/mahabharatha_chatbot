1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,420
Son Karna,
your mother is here.

2
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,290
Hoping to get something
in charity from you.

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,420
Will you be able
to make her an offering?

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,490
Queen Mother.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,260
No, son.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,390
Just mother.

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,260
Your mother.

8
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,490
It took tremendous courage
to come to you.

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,230
Tremendous courage...

10
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,200
It took so long
for a Warrior's mother

11
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,290
to gather courage?

12
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,360
At the time
of your birth

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,320
I didn't have
the courage.

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
I had to face
the entire society.

15
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,350
I could have accepted

16
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,230
my character being questioned

17
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,280
but

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
what about my father's honour?

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,200
How could've
I tarnished that, son?

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,260
Definitely your father's dignity
must have been more valuable

21
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,190
than your son's life.

22
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,120
No, son.

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,130
I have committed
a big mistake.

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,190
I lacked the sense
to understand

25
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,360
the result that
my mistake would yield.

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,390
I am the result of your mistake.

27
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,090
My entire life is the result
of your mistake.

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,060
I...

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,260
I'm here to rectify
that mistake, son.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,290
I'm here to be
your mother.

31
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,060
Now you come
to be my mother?

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,090
Now you come?

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,260
What do I do
about that mother of mine

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,260
who has stayed up

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,060
for many nights, weeping

36
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,130
whenever I slept hungry?

37
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,290
Whenever someone ridiculed me
upon seeing a bow in my hand

38
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,290
she held my hand

39
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,060
and taught me tolerance.

40
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,300
What do I do
about that mother

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,150
who is weeping
right now

42
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,190
because now people will
no more address me as her son

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,190
but as someone
else's son?

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,100
What do I do
about that mother

45
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,060
who embraced me

46
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,090
when you abandoned me?

47
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,160
What do I do
about that mother?

48
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,220
Abandoning you

49
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,130
was my mistake.

50
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,160
Please forgive me, son.
Forgive me.

51
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
But

52
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,000
I am here now

53
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,190
as your mother.

54
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,160
We can change
the circumstances, son.

55
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,120
We can change everything.

56
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,000
How can one change
the past, Queen Mother?

57
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
You had abandoned me.

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,930
Can you change that?

59
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,060
I was always in front of you

60
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
but you never accepted me.

61
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,090
Can you change
this situation?

62
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,920
My younger brothers
are my enemies, today.

63
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,990
Can you change
this situation?

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,900
A fruit fallen
off a tree

65
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,090
cannot be put back
on the tree, Queen Mother.

66
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,000
No one can change
the past.

67
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,930
Neither you, nor me...
No one.

68
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,830
Your son has drowned
in the tide of misfortune

69
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,950
in which you had
abandoned him.

70
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Queen Mother.

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Please

72
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,930
help me find
my son, Karna.

73
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,050
Where will you
look for him?

74
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,860
Even after the inferno
has calmed down

75
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,930
you can feel the heat
in the ashes.

76
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,990
In the same manner

77
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,860
even your son
is burning

78
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,890
in the flames
of pain and humiliation.

79
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,900
Don't try to find him now,
Queen Mother.

80
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,030
We can end this complexity,
this bitterness, son.

81
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,900
Now, you will no more
receive pain

82
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,000
insult or tears.

83
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,990
You will now be called
a Pandava.

84
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,830
You'll be referred to
as the eldest of my sons.

85
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,930
Abandon Duryodhana's side, son.

86
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,890
Come to the side of your
brothers and guide them.

87
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,920
Abandon my friend?

88
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,850
The hand that helped me gain
foot during troubled times...

89
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,890
You want me
to leave that hand?

90
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,890
If this is how I repay for all
the favours bestowed on me

91
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,900
will that make you
proud of me?

92
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,960
Duryodhana has always been
unrighteous.

93
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,820
Why are you taking his side,
son? - Because he had once

94
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,950
committed a righteous deed.

95
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,730
In the arena, that day

96
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,890
he kept aside
caste, creed

97
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,900
social classes, position
and everything

98
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,950
and offered his friendship
to me.

99
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,830
The righteous grandsire Bhishma
never did any such thing.

100
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,830
The knowledgeable mentor Drona
never did this.

101
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,900
Even the person who gave
birth to me

102
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,900
did not lend her support.

103
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,860
During those dark times

104
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,730
only one hand
offered support.

105
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,630
And for that one
righteous deed

106
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,660
I can sacrifice a hundred lives
for Prince Duryodhana.

107
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,760
My weapons will forever

108
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,660
be indebted to
Prince Duryodhana, Queen Mother.

109
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,820
Will you wield arms

110
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,730
against your own brothers, son?

111
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,890
And that will be the most
disastrous result

112
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,660
of the mistake
you've committed.

113
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,340
Even after I surrendered
to Duryodhana

114
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,080
why did you not accept me?

115
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,070
Had you done so, mother

116
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,210
then today, I would have
been known as your son.

117
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,240
I would have stood
in your favour.

118
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,270
But now...

119
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,080
Now, the time has changed.

120
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,180
I am...

121
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,150
I am bound today.

122
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,120
I witness immorality
and atrocity at every step.

123
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,120
My soul dies
at every step, but I...

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,210
I am bound by a promise.

125
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,020
Buried under favours bestowed.

126
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,980
I cannot sacrifice the prince.

127
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,210
I cannot give up on my promise.

128
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,140
I would lose
my self-respect, then.

129
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,070
Whenever my arrows

130
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,210
would injure my brothers

131
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,070
my heart would bleed too.

132
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,050
I would have to live
through this anguish.

133
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,010
But, I...

134
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,910
I cannot break my vows
and go against my duties.

135
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,010
Then do not participate
in the war, son.

136
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,180
Even that encompasses creed.

137
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,010
Vrushali has a question
for you, Queen Mother.

138
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,910
Is it reasonable for one's
pride to be their creed?

139
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,910
Or is one being proud
of their creed

140
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,910
appropriate?

141
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,070
One's creed turning
into their pride

142
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,110
is legitimate.

143
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am aware of my creed.

144
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,040
I cannot renounce it.

145
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,040
Neither my creed

146
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,110
nor Prince Duryodhana.

147
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,880
Farewell, Queen Mother.

148
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,010
You chose to remain silent
throughout your life.

149
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,940
But the pain

150
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,880
was borne by me alone.

151
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,970
I am accustomed
to living in anguish.

152
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,070
But by breaking your silence

153
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,010
please do not hurt everyone.

154
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,980
Do not tell my five brothers
about this truth.

155
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,980
I am well aware

156
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,950
that they are firm
in their creed.

157
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,850
They would surrender
immediately.

158
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
And I...

159
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,820
I would slay their competence
and dedicate it

160
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,040
to Prince Duryodhana.

161
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,020
Let the war materialise, mother.

162
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Do not inform them
of my torment.

163
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,840
Their joy lies
in their ignorance.

164
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,010
I have...

165
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,940
I have always lived
as the son of Radha

166
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,910
and that will be my identity
till death.

167
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,950
How can I help it, son?

168
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
My own sons

169
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,780
slaying each other...

170
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,970
How can I be an audience to it?

171
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,750
How can the consequences
of one error of mine

172
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
be so dreadful?

173
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,970
How is it fair, son?

174
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,750
How can it be so?

175
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,970
How?

176
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,750
How could it be so?

177
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,750
Weren't you here to ask
for a grant, mother?

178
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,880
Let me accord you with one.

179
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,750
You would need to mourn
the death of only one son.

180
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,880
I wouldn't slay the remaining
four sons of yours.

181
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,840
Only Arjuna and I

182
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,680
would combat to vanquish
the other.

183
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,910
If I die
at the hands of Arjuna

184
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,840
all five sons of yours
would remain alive.

185
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,880
But if Arjuna dies
at my hands

186
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,650
even then five sons of yours
would remain alive.

187
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,680
Because then...

188
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,840
I would address you as 'mother'.

189
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,820
This is my promise,
Queen Mother.

190
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,750
And this is my grant to you.

191
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,030
Karna...

192
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,870
Madhav has sent a message.

193
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hastinapur has rejected
our peace treaty.

194
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,930
I will direct all of our troops

195
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,910
to leave for the river route.
- They don't want peace

196
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,910
but don't mind facing
total obliteration.

197
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,910
Don't say that, Your Highness.

198
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,070
You can term this as the first
step of a new beginning.

199
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,040
You are right.

200
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,910
Arjuna... Bhima... Send a message
across to all our allies.

201
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,970
Request all of their armies
to assemble with ours.

202
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,940
My dear sons, take note
of your weapons and courage.

203
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,070
Get ready for war!
