1
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,830
Mahadev, help us.

2
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,820
Parashuram's celestial axe and
Bheesma's 'Brahmastra'

3
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,710
if the weapons
collide then it will be

4
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,730
catastrophic for
the entire universe, my Lord.

5
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,660
Mahadev.

6
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,620
Stop, Parashuram.

7
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,580
Bheeshma has passed your test.

8
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,810
If the two of you
keep fighting each other

9
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,760
the entire universe
will be annihilated.

10
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,630
But I have not yet
got justice, Mahadev.

11
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,790
Then how can you
stop this battle?

12
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,710
Lord Parashuram is bound
by his promise, Mahadev.

13
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,850
Until my mind is not at rest

14
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,580
Lord Parashuram
must continue this battle.

15
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,630
My Lord,
fulfill this wish of mine.

16
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,610
I wish to see him dead, Mahadev.

17
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,760
I wish to be
the cause of his death.

18
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,860
As it is a plea to
Lord Parashuram

19
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I must fulfill your wish.

20
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,810
But I cannot foster

21
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,620
the negative feeling
of vengeance.

22
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,620
Aiming at a higher goal

23
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,830
or noble deed

24
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,780
when you wish
the death of Bheeshma

25
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,870
you will surely become
the cause of his death.

26
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,830
Then I do not wish to live.

27
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,750
But I shall be reborn

28
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,670
to have my vengeance.

29
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,820
Expunge your heart of this
bitterness, Princess Amba.

30
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,720
I promise you...

31
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,790
When the day ordained
by Lord Shiva arrives

32
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,670
I shall lay down my weapons
when I confront you.

33
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,710
I do not require
your generosity, Bheeshma.

34
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,600
I shall not forgive you.

35
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,670
Even after 25 years

36
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,770
I shall be born with the resolve
to kill you.

37
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,700
The throne of Hastinapur for
which you have ruined my life

38
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,690
you will strive day and night
for that very throne.

39
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,660
The throne will never allow you

40
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,730
to sleep peacefully at night.

41
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,730
You will run

42
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,770
and the throne will
make you run your whole life

43
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,810
and when your soul
will be aged and fatigued

44
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,880
I shall come then

45
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,750
as your doom.

46
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,530
'Panchal
Town of Kampawa.'

47
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,430
'25 Years Later.'

48
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,270
Shakti is finally born
in the kingdom of Panchal.

49
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,330
Royal Astrologer,
I am quite certain

50
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,400
that Drupada's queen must have

51
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,520
given birth to a daughter.

52
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,440
I have been awaiting
the birth of this girl

53
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,410
for the past 25 years.

54
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,300
Ever since I have known

55
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,410
that a woman will be the cause
Bheeshma's death.

56
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,320
I have been praying to the Lord

57
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,430
for that girl to be born

58
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,490
in our family.

59
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,450
A daughter is born, father.

60
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,360
All hail Goddess Mahakali!

61
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,450
My wish has been fulfilled,
Drupada.

62
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,350
Bheeshma had insulted me

63
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,470
and our entire kingdom.

64
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,560
'Do not make the mistake
of instigating me'

65
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,450
'otherwise the whole of Panchal
will burn the way Lanka did!'

66
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,540
This girl will avenge the insult.

67
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,470
There is nothing more beautiful

68
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,500
than revenge
in this entire world.

69
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,300
The birth of this girl child

70
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,480
has brought all the beauty
of the world to me.

71
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,480
And that is why,
this girl shall be

72
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,480
called Shikhandini

73
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,560
Royal Astrologer

74
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,300
what do the stars say
about my granddaughter?

75
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,330
It was 12:07 PM today

76
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,570
when this girl child was born.

77
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,370
Rahu has a great influence
on her fate.

78
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,350
This girl will surely be
successful in carrying out

79
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,390
all the duties of her life.

80
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,380
But only after a great struggle

81
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,420
Struggle is the best teacher.

82
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,420
I will poison

83
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,350
this girl against Bheeshma!

84
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,540
I firmly believe

85
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,460
that this girl will be the
cause of Bheeshma's death.

86
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,480
To ruminate over
the death of Bheeshma

87
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,420
will be the sole purpose
of Shikhandini.

88
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,540
The wishes and ambitions
of ancestors

89
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,370
and also their anger,
enmity and revenge

90
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,290
become the legacy
of the future generations.

91
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,530
Parents try their best
to give their children

92
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,510
all the happiness of the world

93
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,310
but end up giving them
their agony as wealth.

94
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,380
They intend to give them love

95
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,550
but end up filling them
with hate.

96
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,340
Think about it.

97
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,510
What have you
taught your children?

98
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,330
You must have given them
love, knowledge and wealth

99
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,360
but did you not fill their
hearts with hate as well.

100
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,530
Did you not impart to them

101
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,400
the preconceived notions of
good and bad?

102
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,380
Does the struggle of one man
with another

103
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,540
that of one society with another

104
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,370
and that of a nation
with another

105
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,440
not get decided by these
preconceived notions?

106
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,430
Do murder, death and bloodshed

107
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,520
not arise from these
preconceived notions?

108
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,330
In other words

109
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,260
parents give their children
life as well as death.

110
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,540
They give them the light of love
as well as the darkness of hate

111
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,420
and darkness may reside
in the mind of one

112
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,410
or may even be a real one

113
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,280
but the only result of it
is fear.

114
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,560
Only fear.

115
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,400
Think about it.

116
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,360
'Hastinapur.'

117
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,460
'Sindh.'

118
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,330
'Adra.'

119
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,510
'Gandhar.'

120
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,310
Kshubbha!

121
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,370
Kshubbha!

122
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,750
Princess Gandhari,
I am right here.

123
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,770
Aghuna, Kaarya,
quit staring at me

124
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,670
and go and bring
an earthen lamp.

125
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,670
Princess, please calm down.

126
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,740
All the lamps will be lit soon.

127
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,780
The breeze extinguished them.
Please calm down.

128
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
Aghuna, the two of you
were ordered

129
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,860
to be in this chamber with lamps
in your hands the whole night!

130
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,850
Then how could the lamps
get extinguished?

131
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,860
Do you not know how scared

132
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,690
Princess Gandhari
is of the dark?

133
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,700
Why am I so afraid of the dark?

134
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,840
Not just you, Princess Gandhari

135
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,740
everyone is afraid of the dark

136
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,750
because our eyes are
our windows to the world.

137
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,670
If one has vision,
one has everything.

138
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,900
But one feels completely
lost in the dark.

139
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,950
The whole world vanishes.

140
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,850
That is why we are
afraid of the dark.

141
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,770
But now, you need not fear it.

142
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,710
You should go back to sleep now.

143
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,690
Such a big army!

144
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,680
I must inform King Subal
about this right away.

145
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,710
A huge army

146
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,880
great strength

147
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,890
and a kingdom which is
wealthier than Lord Kuber

148
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,770
is where my daughter
will be married, sir.

149
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,700
And her husband
will be so good looking

150
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,830
that he will give tough
competition to even Gods.

151
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,790
He will be stronger than
the God of wind

152
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,810
and will have more qualities
than Lord Indra himself.

153
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,810
Any disability

154
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,660
or the slightest flaw

155
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,700
then my Gandhari will not
be married to such a man.

156
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,780
Our daughter is remarkable, sir.

157
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,710
After all, Lord Shiva has given
her the boon to have 100 sons.

158
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,910
'Princess Gandhari.'

159
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,780
What is the matter, sir?

160
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,760
While reading Gandhari's horoscope

161
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,660
why have you become so grave?

162
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,850
Pardon me, your Majesty.

163
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,710
The stars in her...
- Your Highness

164
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,750
General Shatashwa requests
permission to meet the king.

165
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,930
As this hour?

166
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,710
But the king
is occupied right now.

167
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,800
Your Highness,
pardon my intrusion

168
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,860
but the news is such

169
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,690
that I must converse
with the king right away.

170
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,930
What news do you have,
Shatashwa?

171
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,710
Whom does the army belong to?

172
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,680
We have sent our messengers
to find out, my lord.

173
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,670
The soldier
who delivered this news

174
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,850
had not seen
the flag of the army.

175
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,670
How much time will it
take them to reach here?

176
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,910
About six to nine hours,
your Majesty.

177
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,940
Where is Prince Shakuni?
- He is on a journey

178
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,820
for some special purpose.

179
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,860
Someone has dared to attack
the kingdom of Gandhar!

180
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,870
And to attack without
prior notice

181
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,760
is against the Indian rules
of warfare, your Majesty.

182
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,850
Then I shall punish them

183
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,760
for disregarding the rules
of our nation, Lohit!

184
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,760
I will annihilate that army!

185
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,760
This is Gandhar!

186
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,930
Each soldier here has the
strength of a hundred elephants.

187
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,640
Each one of them is like
a brave lion.

188
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,760
But your Majesty,
we have a very small army.

189
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,930
It's courage that brings victory
not weapons, Lohit.

190
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,920
My soldiers will tear apart
the armour of the enemies

191
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,820
and rip their hearts out!

192
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,720
Shatashwa.
- Yes, your Majesty.

193
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,700
Prepare the army.

194
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,710
Tell all the soldiers
to bid goodbye to their families.

195
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,700
Order every citizen
to pick up a weapon.

196
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,810
This will be a terrible battle!
