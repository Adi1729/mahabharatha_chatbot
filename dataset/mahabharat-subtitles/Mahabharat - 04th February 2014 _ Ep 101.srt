1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,370
If marrying Karna

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,400
is not what Draupadi wants

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,350
then she can
certainly say no to it.

4
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,470
The Crown Prince
of Hastinapur, Duryodhan

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,270
is making his entrance
for the competition!

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,280
Greetings, King Drupad.

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,270
To take part in this competition

8
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,240
instead of me,
I call upon my friend

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,300
the King of Anga, Karna

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,170
who has dedicated his competence
to our friendship.

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,400
This way, King Karna of Anga.

12
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,370
Where are you, Prince Arjun?

13
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,250
Where are you headed,
'Brahmins'?

14
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,180
Greetings, revered one.

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,280
Greetings.

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,340
All of us are on our way
to seek alms.

17
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,180
To seek alms here?

18
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,340
Kampilya is like Lord Kuber's* treasury at the moment
*The Lord of Wealth.

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,370
and you have come here
to seek alms?

20
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,180
It is just like,
despite having a river nearby

21
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,180
a rodent is licking
the dry earth.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,240
We do not wish to go
to Kampilya, revered one.

23
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,200
We need to proceed towards
Naimisharanya shortly.

24
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,310
If you can offer us some alms

25
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,300
we would be grateful
to you, revered one.

26
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,340
What can I give you?

27
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,140
I am sitting here with the hope
of reaching Kampilya myself.

28
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,100
But I am a cripple.

29
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,080
If I could walk then I would
have certainly gone there.

30
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,340
One would get to have
novel dishes there

31
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,200
and would get gold coins.

32
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,210
And I suggest that you
should go there as well

33
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,080
and take me there
on your shoulders.

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Pardon us, revered one

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,080
but we do not wish to go there.

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,080
Listen

37
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,240
you need not worry
about how I return.

38
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,200
I shall arrange for it.

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,010
But just take me there.

40
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,240
I would be grateful for it.

41
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,270
Why would all of you serve me

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,180
when my own sons
have forsaken me?

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,180
A cripple has no one
in this world.

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,180
No one...

45
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,200
This way.

46
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,010
Pardon us, King of Anga!

47
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,000
But you cannot be allowed
to do that.

48
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,070
The person who marries my sister

49
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,770
will have to demonstrate
his competence himself.

50
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,830
But this is not a fair
competition, Prince.

51
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,870
Competence cannot be judged
solely by one's archery skills.

52
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,840
Crown Prince Duryodhan
is a competent warrior.

53
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,930
When it comes to
fighting with a mace

54
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,780
he is superior than all
the Princes present here.

55
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,910
Had this competition
involved fighting with a mace

56
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,810
Crown Prince Duryodhan
would certainly

57
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,940
have emerged
as the superior one.

58
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,040
But to have my sister married

59
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,740
to the most superior
archer of the world

60
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,740
is our decision.

61
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,880
Nevertheless

62
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,780
on behalf of Crown
Prince Duryodhan

63
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,900
I have the right to take part
in this competition.

64
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,780
The competence of
a King's trusted soldier

65
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,870
is deemed that of the King.

66
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,710
And I

67
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,710
have dedicated myself
to Crown Prince Duryodhan.

68
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,810
That is why,
when I achieve the goal

69
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,710
my victory will be deemed
that of Crown Prince Duryodhan.

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,940
This is the prevalent tradition
of the Aryan region.

71
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,780
This may be a tradition
of Hastinapur, King of Anga

72
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,840
but not of Panchal!

73
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900
I do not give you
the permission.

74
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
Please go back to your place.

75
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,780
This time,
you have been defeated

76
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,900
in the name of tradition,
my dear.

77
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,710
What will you do now?

78
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,610
In the name of tradition,
you have insulted

79
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,640
the competence of a person,
King Drupad!

80
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,750
I, the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur

81
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,710
ask you

82
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,740
what you intend to do.

83
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
If you wanted to insult
so many King and Princes

84
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,730
then for the Ashvamedha 'Yajna,'* you could have let the horses
*Releasing a horse to roam for a year, and if it wanders into neighbouring provinces hostile to the sacrificer, they must be subjugated.

85
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,610
run freely in the
entire Aryan region!

86
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,750
That way, your competence would
have been proved before all.

87
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,770
Your Highness.

88
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,640
Crown Prince Duryodhan

89
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,670
to worry for
his daughter's future

90
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,640
is not only
the right of a father

91
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,710
but also his responsibility.

92
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,770
That is why, a 'swayamvar'
is deemed a noble deed.

93
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,540
And to deem the defeat
in a 'swayamvar' an insult

94
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,570
is not correct.

95
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,650
King Karna of Anga
has no fear of defeat.

96
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,610
Snatching the right to
take part in the competition

97
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,600
is what I deem an insult,
Vasudev Krishna.

98
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,780
A tree can be nourished
only by water.

99
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,580
Milk cannot do what water can.

100
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Similarly

101
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,550
the proof of your competence

102
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,700
cannot be given
by another person, Prince.

103
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,620
But my friend certainly can
prove his competence.

104
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,510
Friend Karna
pick up that bow

105
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,670
and achieve the goal.

106
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,830
Friend Karna pick
up that bow

107
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,930
and achieve the goal.

108
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,830
That is a splendid decision,
my dear!

109
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,830
A splendid decision!

110
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,890
Listen, King Drupad.

111
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,670
My friend is the King of Anga.

112
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,900
He has every right to take part
in this competition.

113
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,830
He shall marry your daughter.

114
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,590
Draupadi

115
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,730
King Karna of Anga
may win the competition.

116
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,020
'In the entire Aryan region,
this competition can be won'

117
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,030
'by two people, Your Highness.'

118
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,250
'The son of Pandu, Arjun'

119
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,230
'and
the King of Anga, Karna.'

120
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
'If marrying Karna
is not what Draupadi wants'

121
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,230
'then she can certainly
say no to it.'

122
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,030
Stop!

123
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,990
I will not marry the
son of a charioteer.
