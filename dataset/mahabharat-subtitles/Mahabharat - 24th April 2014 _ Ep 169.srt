1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,500
There should indeed be a war,
Grandsire.

2
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,340
I do not approve of this war.

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,440
Grandsire Bheeshma
is right indeed.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,270
Nothing can be more unfortunate

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,370
than war, my lad.

6
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,270
Uncle!
- But...

7
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,490
A clever human is the one

8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,340
who always strives to ensure

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,500
there is no war in his yard.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,500
If today there is no war
in Virat's yard

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,470
in future,

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,340
in the yard
of Hastinapur

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,210
there shall be an epic battle.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,340
Grandsire Bheeshma.

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,400
At that time, you shall be
the commander in chief.

16
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,200
And at the blade of your sword

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,470
shall lie the heads
of the Pandavas.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,230
Are you here to destroy
Hastinapur,

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,430
Lord of Gandhar?

20
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,230
Me?

21
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,430
Do you think I am here
to destroy?

22
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,300
I am here

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,170
just to

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,400
fulfill your word,

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,370
Grandsire Bheeshma.

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,170
You had arrived to Gandhar.

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,170
You had my beloved sister

28
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,360
betrothed

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,390
with a promise

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,170
that you shall make her

31
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,300
the empress of Hastinapur

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,270
and that her hundred sons

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,300
will be the rulers
of Hastinapur.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,270
That you shall make them

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,330
the sovereign rulers.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,330
How badly could the promise

37
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,200
made by you fail
Grandsire Bheeshma.

38
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,270
If an elephant's foot

39
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,200
comes into a crocodile's grasp

40
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,300
it causes a huge dilemma
to the crocodile

41
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,140
Grandsire Bheeshma.

42
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,270
It can neither devour

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,310
the colossal elephant

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,110
nor can it spare the elephant.

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,240
Now, it is my request to you

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
Grandsire Bheeshma.

47
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,340
Either crown my dear lad

48
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,230
Duryodhan

49
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,310
as the sovereign ruler

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,300
or, because of you

51
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,070
Hastinapur shall face
annihilation.

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,070
Please come forth,

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,170
revered commander in chief.

54
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,140
The fortress of Virat

55
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
awaits to be destroyed

56
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,230
by your hands.

57
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,130
'Bahika'.*
*Madra was a part of the Bahika/Vahika or Madra was Vahika country, at current central parts of Punjab — between river Chenab and Ravi.

58
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,130
Your majesty.

59
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,000
A vast army has laid siege
to the northern gate.

60
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,130
All our forces must go
for the defence of Virat.

61
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
I shall lead the charge.
- Your Majesty!

62
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,200
Even I will participate.

63
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,160
My Lord, please do not
participate in the battle yet.

64
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,170
If I feel I am losing the battle
I shall send you a message.

65
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,230
No, Your Majesty.
I cannot stand back.

66
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,970
My Lord, someone has to stay to
defend the fortress from within.

67
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,110
Arjun shall stay in the fortress
to defend women and children.

68
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,200
Because he cannot charge
into battle guised as a woman.

69
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,100
Won't I participate in the war?

70
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,160
What mockery is this,
elder brother?

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,030
Bheem is right, Arjun.

72
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,130
You must stay
within the fortress.

73
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,190
But...

74
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,970
Arjun. If Duryodhan sees
a woman in the battlefield

75
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,160
he shall surely doubt.

76
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,990
Let us go, My Lord.

77
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,100
My brothers and I

78
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,930
are ready for
the defence of Virat.

79
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Please come.

80
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,970
Soldiers!
Defend your Kingdom.

81
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,870
Charge!

82
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,870
Please give our forces
the orders to charge

83
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,990
Commander in chief.

84
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,970
Virat has not yet shown any sign
of defence,

85
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,000
King of Gandhar.

86
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,040
If King Virat won't arm himself

87
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,100
how could we attack them?

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,910
But the preliminary attack
on the fortresses has begun

89
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,990
Grandsire.

90
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,930
How can there be an attack
without my orders

91
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,730
king of Gandhar?

92
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,960
Who ordered it?

93
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,930
Only the army of Hastinapur
takes orders from you

94
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,770
My Lord.

95
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,910
And I didn't order the attack.

96
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,940
The attack was made by King Susharman of Trigartha.*
*Modern Kangra district, the territory around the three rivers of Satluj, Beas, and Ravi.

97
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,870
Please give the orders
for the attack, My Lord.

98
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,930
Grandsire!

99
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,960
Greetings My Queen.

100
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,870
A vast army led by Hastinapur
has attacked the southern gate.

101
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,770
An attack from the other side?

102
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,900
But there is no one in
the fortress who can defend it.

103
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,900
Who shall go forth
for retaliation?

104
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,930
Forgive me, My Queen.

105
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,770
But Prince Uttar
is inside the fortress.

106
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,770
And it is the duty of the prince

107
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,770
to retaliate to this attack.

108
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,670
Yes!
I shall charge into the battle.

109
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,740
How is that possible?

110
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,770
Uttar is still very young.

111
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,930
He has no experience in battle.

112
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,790
No! No!

113
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,830
He cannot charge
into the battle.

114
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,900
Excuse me, My Queen.

115
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,800
But the son of a king cannot be
exempted from his duty.

116
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,630
I do not wish to be exempted,
either.

117
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,770
I am eager for battle, mother.

118
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,830
Be quiet!

119
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,870
Brihannala is neither a man,
nor a woman.

120
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,900
How would a eunuch know the
gravity of politics and battle?

121
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,690
My Queen.

122
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,640
There is no need
to insult Brihannala.

123
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,730
Brihannala handled the reins
of Prince Arjun's chariot.

124
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,630
And has faced many battles.

125
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,870
And even now, I am ready to be
the rider of Prince Uttar's

126
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,630
chariot.

127
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,670
Before any weapon
lays a scratch on Prince Uttar

128
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,860
It shall have to go through me.

129
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,690
This is my promise.

130
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,600
I shall instill the son of
the great warrior King Virat

131
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,730
with bravery

132
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,660
and not cowardice.

133
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,640
But will a woman
drive my chariot?

134
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,800
If that happens
all shall mock me.

135
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,740
But when your weapons
slay them

136
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,790
you shall be the one
laughing at them, Prince.

137
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,790
Come.

138
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,600
But, Brihannala.

139
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,800
Grandsire Bheeshma
is at the forefront.

140
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,740
What if he comes to know
of who the chariot rider is?

141
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,630
I do not fear
Grandsire Bheeshma.

142
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,800
And Prince Duryodhan
cannot recognise me before dusk.

143
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,760
Just a few hours remain

144
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,540
for my exile to come to an end.

145
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,770
Where are the Pandavas, uncle?

146
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,770
Why aren't they showing up?

147
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,830
It shall be dusk soon!

148
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,760
We do not have much time, uncle!

149
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,740
Did I not tell you, my lad?

150
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,730
The righteous ones
can witness treachery

151
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,870
but cannot commit it.

152
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,630
Look over there!

153
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,860
The Pandavas have arrived!

154
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
Uncle.

155
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,730
Look at this!

156
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,600
The prince of Virat is here
under a woman's protection.

157
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,660
He is a lad, Dushyasan.

158
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Yet he has arrived for battle.

159
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,700
But those five Pandavas

160
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,600
have still not arrived
for battle.

161
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,670
They must be hiding
as a rat hides in a burrow.

162
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,800
Blow the conch, my lad.

163
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,800
They are hiding somewhere
inside Virat.

164
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,570
Arjun!
Come out!

165
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,760
Let go of your safety

166
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,800
and protect your honour.

167
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,530
Even Karna must be arriving
in order to slay you!

168
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,690
Come out!

169
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,560
With your bow, the 'Gandiva'!

170
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,500
Prince Uttar, pick up your bow!

171
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,600
Shoot arrows how I instruct you.

172
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,690
I shall not let anything
happen to you.

173
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,690
Pick up your bow!

174
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,730
Shoot, Prince!

175
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,630
Shoot the arrow!

176
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,500
Shoot, Prince Uttar!

177
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Shoot the arrow, Prince Uttar!

178
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,660
Uncle, this lad must be slain!

179
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,400
If this prince dies

180
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,660
maybe those five Pandavas
shall show themselves.

181
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,590
Before the sun sets

182
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,600
we must drive them out.

183
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,400
Very well, my lad.

184
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,630
Grandsire Bheeshma!

185
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,500
Order our forces to attack!

186
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,400
I do not attack women,
king of Gandhar.

187
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,600
Only when a warrior arrives

188
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,560
shall my army charge forth

189
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,400
and my weapons will unsheathe.

190
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,490
Prepare for battle, prince!

191
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,600
Only a few moments remain.

192
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,470
I shall not let you be harmed.
- No, Brihannala!

193
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,530
I cannot fight

194
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,500
these warriors
and this vast army.

195
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,600
Protect me, Brihannala!

196
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,370
Steer the chariot
back to the fortress.

197
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,560
If you wish to be
a strong warrior

198
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,390
of the likes of prince Arjun

199
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,340
first learn to stand your ground
in the battlefield.

200
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,330
Raise your bow,
shoot an arrow!

201
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,560
You say Arjun is
a great warrior?

202
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,570
A warrior who is hiding
inside the fortress.

203
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,430
They claim that the Pandavas
are hiding in our fortress.

204
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,400
Then why won't they
come forth to protect us.

205
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,320
Protection is acquired by those

206
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,380
who dare to raise
their weapons first.

207
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,360
Prince Uttar,
raise your weapons!

208
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,220
Just a few moments more!
- No, Brihannala!

209
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,480
I cannot do it!

210
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,490
Protect me, Brihannala!

211
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,310
Steer the chariot away
from here, Brihannala!

212
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,450
Go' prince!
Go!

213
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,320
Your father has given
refuge to the Pandavas.

214
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,220
Before the sun sets

215
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,320
send the Pandavas
out of these gates.

216
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,390
Or else, every citizen
within this fortress shall die.

217
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,460
Go!
Warn Arjun!

218
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Brihannala!

219
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,410
Why did you bring
the chariot here?

220
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,350
Steer it back into the fortress.

221
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,220
Brihannala!

222
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,250
Oh Fire God!

223
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,320
Today, it shall be a year
to my exile.

224
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,250
Today I am free to turn into
Arjun from Brihannala.

225
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
But today my mettle
shall be put to test as well.

226
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,420
And without your grace

227
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,160
this devotee of yours
is incomplete.

228
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,220
Please return my 'Gandiva' bow
and grace me, O' Lord!
