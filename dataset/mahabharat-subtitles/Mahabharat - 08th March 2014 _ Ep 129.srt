1
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,620
King Karna of Anga!

2
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,590
Greetings.

3
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,600
Have you come here
to look at our city?

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,460
Bless you, Arjun!

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,530
I have no interest in your city.

6
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,460
This maiden here is Vrushali.

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,620
By the time the subjects of
Hastinapur

8
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,650
were allowed to migrate
to Indraprastha

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,590
she had already left Hastinapur.

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,530
That is why,
she is your subject.

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,600
I am here
to drop her off safely.

12
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,650
And what arrangements have you
made for your safety King?

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Did you forget

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,460
that our mother
has been imprisoned?

15
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,460
Not only mother

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,390
but also the subjects have been
imprisoned by Hastinapur.

17
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,550
The subjects have not been
imprisoned, Prince Sahadev.

18
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,400
Just to maintain order
in the kingdom

19
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,520
such a restriction has been
imposed on them for a while.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,500
Crown Prince Duryodhan
will certainly

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,490
work towards the interest
of all his subjects.

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,550
And Prince Nakul

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,450
Queen Mother Kunti is not
a prisoner in Hastinapur

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,430
but a member
of the royal family.

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,390
It is her decision
not to come here.

26
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,530
That is a lie!

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,550
Why would our mother not come
to the reverence of our city?

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,420
Do not argue, Nakul.

29
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,430
The shadow of a container
does not have the right

30
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,360
to decide in which direction
its shadow should be cast.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,550
All its life

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,520
the container
and the light decide its fate.

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,360
How would the King of Anga know

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,560
what the truth is
and what isn't?

35
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,360
He merely rotes what
brother Duryodhan says.

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,520
I have renounced the kingdom
of Anga, Arjun!

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,260
I am an ordinary subject now.

38
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,450
I have no obligation
to decline a duel with you

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
and neither do you!

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,330
Pick up your bow, Arjun!

41
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,520
Let us decide right away
who is superior amongst us!

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,420
Calm down, Maharathi Karna.

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,230
When there is a reason to fight

44
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,260
we will certainly
engage in a battle.

45
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,450
But at the moment

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,260
you are a guest of Indraprastha.

47
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,490
And the Pandavas will not
draw their weapons on a guest.

48
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,460
I do not require
your protection, Vasudev.

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,200
I am protected
by Lord Surya himself.

50
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,290
I am not here to serve
as a guest to the Pandavas

51
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,260
but to deliver their
mother's message to them.

52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,190
She has sent the message

53
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,320
to become an independent state

54
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,450
right after the reverence
of the city.

55
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Until Indraprastha
has a flag of its own

56
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,360
she will not enter this city.

57
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,300
Are you the only one who knows
this message, Maharathi Karna?

58
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,460
Did you not tell
your beloved friend?

59
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,200
I am a friend of the
Crown Prince Duryodhan

60
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,250
and not his spy.

61
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,130
Until all of you had
not heard this message

62
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,390
your being independent
was merely a suspicion.

63
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,360
And reporting suspicions
is the task of a spy.

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
But now

65
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,160
this is an information

66
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,160
and I will certainly
inform my friend about it.

67
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,160
And if there is a battle

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,260
then in order
to protect my friend

69
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,260
the first one
to take to arms will be me.

70
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,330
This is my duty.

71
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,300
Wonderful, Maharathi Karna.

72
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,360
This is what
we expected from you.

73
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,190
Do take this maiden
to her father.

74
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,990
Listen, maiden.

75
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,090
Is your name not Vrushali?

76
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,100
Another heroic man like him
does not exist in this world.

77
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,120
Before the distance between
you and him increases

78
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,990
if you like

79
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,160
you may go after him.

80
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,060
Maharathi Karna!

81
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,090
Maharathi Karna!

82
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,900
You never let a person go
empty-handed, Maharathi Karna.

83
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Can I get something
in charity as well?

84
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,960
But I have nothing that I can
give you as charity, Vrushali.

85
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,990
Both the kingdom

86
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,050
and the royal treasury
have been renounced by me.

87
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,900
The last few coins left

88
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,900
had been strewn by me
on the river bank.

89
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,060
After renouncing
the royal treasury

90
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,060
what remains with you

91
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,950
is what I wish to have.

92
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,050
May I have

93
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,020
your companionship
as charity, Radheya?

94
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,790
Life with me will be
difficult, Vrushali.

95
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,890
With you

96
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,990
even a difficult life
will become easy, Radheya.

97
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,930
Will you let me walk with you?

98
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,850
Only if you guide me

99
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,790
will I let you.

100
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,950
Only a true warrior
can say that he is a friend

101
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,830
and not a spy.

102
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,990
King Karna of Anga
is an excellent warrior.

103
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,850
Till the two of them
are together

104
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,920
the maiden will be safe.

105
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,950
Till the two of them
are together

106
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Maharathi Karna
will be safe, friend.

107
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,840
Uncle!

108
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,810
Karna has sent a message.

109
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
The Pandavas have decided
to perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

110
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,770
to become independent, uncle!

111
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,700
We cannot stop them

112
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,740
but we can fight them.

113
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,830
Then we shall fight!

114
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,670
We will not fight.

115
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,830
If we fight them

116
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,700
then that sin

117
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,910
will be our cross to bear.

118
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,700
At the time of the division

119
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,740
both the parties had
promised each other

120
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,670
that they will
not attack the other.

121
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,800
Then what is the solution
to this, uncle?

122
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,800
When a river floods

123
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,670
it cannot be stopped.

124
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,760
But before the river floods

125
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,730
a dam can certainly
be built, my darling.

126
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,670
After the reverence
of their city

127
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,740
the Pandavas

128
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,670
can perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

129
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,830
and we cannot stop them.

130
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,630
But

131
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,670
we can certainly stop
the reverence of the city.

132
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,860
One lakh cows

133
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,630
are going

134
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,770
to Indraprastha
for the reverence.

135
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,710
Before those cows

136
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,810
reach Indraprastha,
we must

137
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,730
stop them,
my darling.

138
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,690
But how, uncle?

139
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,830
The Serpent King Takshak.

140
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,730
Serpent King

141
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
one lakh cows

142
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,660
are going to Indraprastha

143
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,470
for the reverence of the city.

144
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,540
If you wish to have your revenge

145
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,730
then before those cows

146
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,440
reach Indraprastha

147
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,500
you should steal them

148
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,600
Serpent King Takshak.

149
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,100
My Lord

150
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,940
Takshak stole our cows and fled.

151
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,900
He fled northward with our
one lakh cows, My Lord!

152
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,800
He fled!
What about the security?

153
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
What about the soldiers?
- He bit all of them!

154
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,800
The reverence of the city is to
take place tomorrow, brother.

155
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,000
But without the cows

156
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,990
how can the reverence
be completed?

157
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
Uncle Shakuni

158
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,060
has come up
with a splendid plan.

159
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,870
Call Nakul.
Get all the soldiers treated.

160
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,930
Employ the serpents of the city

161
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,830
to draw the venom
out of the soldiers.

162
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,990
Ask brother Bheem to make
arrangements to guard the city.

163
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,860
With us busy
looking for the cows

164
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,960
they might intend
to attack the city!

165
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,000
Let me go get my bow.

166
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,000
Brother Arjun

167
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,770
your Gandiva Bow
is in Panchali's chamber!

168
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,970
Apart from brother Yudhishthir,
Panchali's chamber

169
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,870
is off-limits
for the rest of us.

170
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,890
'For an entire year,
Draupadi'

171
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,790
'will be wife
to only one of you.'

172
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,830
'During that period'

173
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,030
'only that person can enter
Draupadi's chamber'

174
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,940
'to whom she gives
the right to do so.'

175
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,760
Brother, if you enter
Panchali's chamber then...

176
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,870
Then...

177
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,890
Then I must
renounce Indraprastha

178
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,800
and go into an exile for years.

179
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
I know, Sahadev.

180
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,800
In order to protect the cows

181
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,930
if I leave the city tonight

182
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,700
I will be able to enter it only
after completing my penance.

183
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,670
But at the moment

184
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,730
this is my duty.
