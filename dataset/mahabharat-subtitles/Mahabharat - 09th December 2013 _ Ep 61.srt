1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,940
Greetings, teacher.

2
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,130
May you be victorious.

3
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,100
Are you prepared for the battle?

4
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,070
Certainly, teacher.

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,010
This is the first battle
of your life.

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,100
Are you scared?

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,100
Do you not trust me, teacher?

8
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,870
I can trust no one
but you, Arjun.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
What is this?

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
It is a riddle, teacher.

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,100
And I am trying
to figure it out.

12
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,010
Greetings.

13
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,100
Do not let
any of the Princes die.

14
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Take all of them in
as prisoners!

15
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,840
Only then will Bhishma
come here

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,870
to die at your hands.

17
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,010
All hail Mahadev!

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,060
All hail Mahadev!

19
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,000
All hail Mahadev!

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,930
Greetings, teacher.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,770
May you be victorious.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Yudhishthir

23
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,810
there's quite the responsibility
on your shoulders

24
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,000
because you are the eldest.

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,840
The respect garnered
from the victory

26
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,900
will be yours.

27
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,860
And even the insult
of the defeat

28
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,740
will be attributed to you.

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Be it a battle or politics,
teacher

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,740
victory belongs to every person

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,940
but defeat belongs
only to the King.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,940
If we are successful
in paying you your fee

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,910
then it will be the success
of the 105 disciples of yours.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,770
But the throne of Hastinapur

35
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,970
cannot have 105 Kings,
brother Yudhishthir!

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,710
You must have understood
the meaning by now.

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,830
This battle is

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,840
not being fought only
to pay our teacher his fee.

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,770
The truth is, this battle

40
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,740
is not between the Kuru Princes
and King Drupad.

41
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,870
It is between you and me.

42
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,870
Answer my question, teacher.

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,680
When our capabilities were being
weighed in terms of your fee

44
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,840
did you have no knowledge then

45
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,810
that all this was being done
in the favour of Yudhishthir?

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,770
The test of your capabilities

47
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,670
was not devised by me, Prince.

48
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,680
You should ask this question
to your father.

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
In the name of righteousness,
my father

50
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,710
has always been the recipient
of deception, teacher.

51
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,670
But I do not wish
to discuss this with you.

52
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,640
If I use my might

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,740
to pay you your fee, teacher

54
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,670
then you cannot object to it.

55
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,640
What do you mean?

56
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,640
It means, brother Yudhishthir

57
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,870
that in this battle

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,740
the help of you or your brothers

59
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,710
will not be required by me.

60
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,710
In this battle, only

61
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,800
the Kauravas will participate.

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,610
How can that be?

63
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,770
If only the Kauravas
fight in this battle

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,770
brother won't get an opportunity
to prove his capability.

65
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,810
There is no other alternative,
brother Bheem.

66
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,670
Anyone older than me

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,830
cannot participate
in this battle.

68
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,800
We 100 brothers

69
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,730
shall have
the fruits of our valour

70
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,570
and you five
getting a share in it

71
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,830
is an injustice I cannot allow.

72
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,780
Arjun, Nakul, Sahadev

73
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,710
can participate in the battle.

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,600
But I shall be the General.

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,570
And the victory
shall be attributed to me.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,630
We cannot accept that.

77
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,710
That was not my request!

78
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,610
The duty and right to pay
our teacher his fee

79
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,640
belong to all the disciples.

80
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,640
I shall also deem you a partner
in paying the fee, Arjun.

81
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,670
I give you my word.

82
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,730
Then why do you worry?

83
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,630
Besides, our teacher

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,510
wants us to pay his fee
by defeating Drupad.

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,670
But the participance
of all the Princes

86
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,730
was not something
he explicitly mentioned.

87
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,500
And what if we
do not accept this?

88
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Then, in the battle, you will

89
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,670
either keep an eye
on Drupad's army

90
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,730
or on the weapons
of my brothers.

91
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,730
We Kuru Princes are
on the borders of Panchal

92
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,740
and us fighting in this manner
is inappropriate, Duryodhan.

93
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,510
This is an insult to our
dynasty and kingdom.

94
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,640
I give you
the first opportunity.

95
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,500
Go on.

96
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,540
May you be victorious!

97
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,570
Brother Yudhishthir

98
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,700
what did you do?

99
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,700
If we do not even
participate in the battle

100
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,610
then we will have no chance
to win, brother Yudhishthir.

101
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,470
Sahadev, why don't you
say something?

102
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,600
I feel, this is an apt strategy.

103
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,370
The enemy is approaching!

104
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,530
Order the first unit of cavalry
to march forth!

105
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,540
The Princes must not
get hurt, General!

106
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,500
They are to be taken in
only as prisoners.

107
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,540
None of the Princes should be
able to leave the battlefield!

108
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,340
I want all the Princes alive!

109
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,530
Soldiers!

110
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,300
Take your positions!

111
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,360
The enemy is approaching!

112
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,530
Attack!

113
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,430
Dusshasan, Vikarna

114
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,390
the army approaching us

115
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,390
is not an army

116
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,460
but a horde of rats!

117
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,330
Hastinapur has defeated them
countless times.

118
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,230
We shall chop Drupad's head off

119
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,390
and hang it on his castle,
brother Duryodhan!

120
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,490
Attack!

121
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,200
Brother Duryodhan,
just look at Drupad's army!

122
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,290
It is easier to defeat them than
harvesting grains from fields!

123
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,270
We are the Kauravas!
No one can defeat us!

124
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,330
Keep attacking.
Drupad must

125
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,270
certainly be at the center
of his army.

126
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,230
Soldiers, change your positions!

127
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,290
Get back to the positions
allocated to all of you!

128
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,320
Do remember!

129
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,200
The Kuru Princes
need to be captured alive!

130
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,230
What are they doing now,
brother Duryodhan?

131
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,230
They must be getting ready
to form a labyrinth.

132
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
But you need not worry!

133
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,130
A 'Sharvyooh' can help navigate
through any type of labyrinth!

134
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,390
Organize yourselves
in the form of an arrow!

135
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,140
And keep your weapons
facing outward!

136
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Allow the Princes
to come inside!

137
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Open the second gate
and close the first one!

138
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Your Majesty

139
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,200
the first gate has been closed

140
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,170
and we have surrounded
the enemy on all the sides.

141
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,260
Splendid. Keep opening
the gates in this manner

142
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,200
and once the enemy is inside

143
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,290
close all the gates behind them!

144
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,230
This is the labyrinth
of King Drupad!

145
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,290
King Drupad's labyrinth!

146
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,160
They will be caught in it
like a fly in a spider web

147
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,090
these ignorant Princes.

148
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,330
Close all the gates one by one!

149
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,990
Our strategy was a success,
Shikhandini.

150
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,100
Take all the Princes in
as prisoners!

151
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,200
None of the Princes
should escape!

152
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,190
W-What is happening,
brother Duryodhan?

153
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,160
We were winning the battle

154
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,230
but how did we end up
becoming prisoners?

155
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,970
They have sealed the exits,
Dusshasan.

156
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,000
Never did I imagine that

157
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,000
Drupad would construct
such a labyrinth.

158
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,100
Even I do not know how to
navigate through this labyrinth.

159
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,030
What do we do now,
brother Duryodhan?

160
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,190
I must now make
my way to Drupad.

161
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,890
Two of the Princes
are still fighting.

162
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,860
I will capture them,
Your Majesty.

163
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,950
In order to defeat these boys

164
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,830
if I have to employ
the Five Gems of mine

165
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,960
then it will be
your defeat, Shikhandini.

166
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,860
I will not let that happen,
father.

167
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,090
I will not let that happen!

168
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,720
You?

169
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,950
Will you fight me?

170
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,950
Does Panchal now

171
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,850
live under the protection
of maidens?

172
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,820
You need to protect
yourself first, Prince.

173
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,760
I am your doom!

174
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,650
Is this what you call
might, King Drupad?

175
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,820
What were you thinking when
making a woman your General?

176
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,850
I have defeated her
with just one blow.

177
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,890
And because of her, even you
got defeated this easily.

178
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,660
Are you absolutely certain

179
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,820
that I am the King of Panchal

180
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,850
Drupad?

181
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,630
Or am I?

182
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,690
Or maybe it's me.

183
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,730
Or am I the real
King of Panchal, Drupad?

184
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,590
Who is the real
King of Panchal, Drupad?
