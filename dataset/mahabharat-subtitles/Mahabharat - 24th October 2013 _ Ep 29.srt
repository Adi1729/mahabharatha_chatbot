1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,020
It's the opinion of the penal
council, Your Highness

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,880
the losses that these people
have incurred

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,880
deems justice mandatory.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,080
Council-Head, please ask them of
the impairments.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,910
Their trust has been impaired,
Your Highness!

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,850
They trusted the royal family
and the king to protect them.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,870
Their trust was priceless,
Your Highness.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,970
In order to reinstate the trust

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,850
let such wealth be bestowed
upon them, grandsire.

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,950
That wouldn't suffice alone,
Your Highness.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,950
In my opinion, the princes
should apologise to them.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,020
This deed will strengthen
their trust in justice

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,820
and it will serve as a moral
lesson for the princes too.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,880
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,080
Excuse me, Your Highness!
Excuse me...

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,040
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,040
There is no need to worry
anymore, Your Highness!

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,980
I was aware that on hearing
about Duryodhan

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,950
you'd be quite worried,
Your Highness.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,810
Hence, I hurried over here
so soon, Your Highness.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There is nothing to worry about.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,040
I have already spoken to
the physician, Your Highness.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,040
The wound will heal soon,
Your Highness.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,780
In no time.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,810
What are you rambling about,
Shakuni?

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,010
What wound?
Whose wound?

27
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,880
Your beloved Duryodhan's life

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,770
is out of danger, Your Highness.

29
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,950
What!

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,780
Duryo...

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,940
Is Duryodhan wounded?

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,780
How?
Answer me, Shakuni.

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,010
Who dared spill my son's blood!

34
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,750
The revolt that these fishermen
created, Your Highness

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,980
counted in every one of them.

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,910
Every one of them was attacking
with a weapon, Your Highness.

37
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,740
Who's weapon it was
that injured Duryodhan

38
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,750
will be impossible to find out,
Your Highness.

39
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,940
Son!
Duryodhan!

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Your Highness...
For attacking the prince...

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,780
I mean, the attackers of
Prince Duryodhan

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,940
should have justice, right?

43
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,850
Justice?

44
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,780
The ones who spilled my son's
blood will have but one fate!

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,780
Off with all their heads!

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,750
But, Your Highness...
- But, Dhritarashtra.

47
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,680
This would be atrocious.

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,870
Justice has been dispensed.

49
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,780
Let the orders be followed.

50
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,910
Forgive us, Your Highness.
Please do not take our lives.

51
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,680
Spare us from a death sentence,
Your Highness!

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,780
Forgive us, Your Highness!

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,720
Spare us from a death sentence,
Your Highness!

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,750
Spare us from a death
sentence, Your Highness!

55
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,650
Spare us from a death sentence,
Your Highness!

56
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,870
Dhritarashtra,
what sort of justice is this?

57
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,880
I have inspected
Duryodhan myself.

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,750
He is not grievously wounded
at all.

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
My son's blood has been spilled,
Queen Mother.

60
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,870
Instead of thinking about
the gravity of their crimes

61
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,710
why are you concerned about
the severity of his wounds?

62
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,770
They have tried to revolt.

63
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,770
They have intended for
the death of the Prince.

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,880
Do these crimes seem so
trivial to you, Queen Mother?

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,610
Even if the accusations
against them are true

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,710
they aren't as grave to effect
a death penalty to so many!

67
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,840
I've been reigning for
many years now, Queen Mother.

68
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,740
I've at least become as wise
to not require your advice.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,610
Wait, Dhritarashtra.

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,610
Such stoicism
doesn't befit a ruler.

71
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,810
Your father Shantanu

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,580
was always a loving
and kind-hearted ruler.

73
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,580
Not one inspiring fear.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,580
Bhishma.

75
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,650
Bhishma, please
say something to Dhritarashtra.

76
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,710
Right after
the coronation

77
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,650
the king's word holds
as good as the law of the God.

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,810
I had told you of the same
earlier itself, Queen Mother.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,650
But I can

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,550
appeal to His Highness.

81
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,620
I appeal to you too,
Your Highness.

82
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,550
I appeal to you too.

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,780
I may not be a citizen
of the kingdom

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,520
yet I appeal, Your Highness.

85
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,620
Please heed her advice.

86
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,570
Your Highness,
you must surely recall

87
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,520
that these fishermen are
Mother Queen's kin.

88
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,580
Punishing them makes her heart
writhe in agony, Your Highness.

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,750
Mother Queen hasn't forgotten
her childhood yet.

90
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,570
Prince Shakuni, that's an act of
impudence to the Queen Mother.

91
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,640
How can

92
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,690
reminding one of his/her clan
be a crime, Chief Minister?

93
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,610
Your Highness, so what
have you finally decided?

94
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,710
Keeping in mind
the feelings of Mother Queen

95
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,520
I change my decision,
Chief Minister.

96
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,650
The fishermen are hereby
banished from this province.

97
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,510
Nowhere in the entire
Kuru province

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,450
do they have permissions
to reside anymore.

99
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,640
Let the orders be followed.

100
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,470
The Queen Mother
or His Highness

101
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,340
aren't questionable
by us.

102
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,380
But you are my sister,
hence I am asking you this.

103
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,420
When the time came to leave
this land of our ancestors

104
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,480
and if you weren't Queen Mother,
rather a member of our family

105
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,180
would your tears have
been sanguine or not?

106
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,210
Just tell me that.

107
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,370
This land and this water

108
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,280
have but our sweat
seeping and flowing in them.

109
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,410
And after death, they have
but assimilated our very bodies.

110
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,340
Then why

111
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,280
are we being banished from here
in vain, Satya?

112
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Queen Mother?

113
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,350
I...

114
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,340
I'm helpless.
- I know.

115
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,220
Everyone is helpless.
The whole province is helpless.

116
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,210
Today if King Pandu
were on that throne

117
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,410
he wouldn't have
sided with his sons'.

118
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,250
Justice would have been
upheld by him.

119
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
And probably

120
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,110
King Pandu's sons wouldn't have
been like these princes, Satya.

121
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,150
A fruit has the taste
which the tree imparts to it.

122
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,340
God knows,
where King Pandu is!

123
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,150
Where are his sons!

124
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,370
Arjun!

125
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,280
Arjun!

126
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,170
Arjun!

127
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,120
Sahadev!
I have found brother Bheem.

128
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,080
Sahadev!
I have found brother Bheem.

129
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,200
Sahadev!

130
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,170
Where is brother Bheem?

131
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,170
Only Nakul can answer
this question.

132
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,170
Nakul

133
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,980
Nakul

134
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,920
Sahadev! Brother Bheem
is behind that rock.

135
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,880
Brother.

136
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,980
Sit.

137
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,110
One for Nakul.

138
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,010
And one for Sahadev.

139
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,970
What are you doing?

140
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,980
Say your prayers first.

141
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,050
So, are you done eating?

142
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,850
Now go and play.

143
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,810
Didn't you just eat?

144
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,810
Didn't I offer you both a 'laddoo'* each?
*A ball-shaped sweet.

145
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,050
Didn't I?

146
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,840
You had, brother Bheem.

147
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,940
But as we closed out eyes
to say our prayers

148
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,910
you devoured our 'laddoo'.

149
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,980
Do you mean to say,
I stole it?

150
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,050
Are you accusing your own
elder brother of stealing?

151
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,870
While you eat it so quick
as if it were the first time!

152
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,050
Aren't you ashamed?

153
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,920
We have just seen them.
We never get to eat them.

154
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,050
It is apt, isn't it?

155
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,020
It isn't appropriate
for kids to eat 'laddoos'.

156
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,780
Eating 'laddoos' can cause
you to fatten up!

157
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,750
Go have the 'sattu'* that mother has prepared for father.
*A foodstuff consisting of a mixture of ground pulses and cereals.

158
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,940
Arjun!
That's my 'laddoo'.

159
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,710
Arjun,
I will beat you up.

160
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,910
Hey, my 'laddoos'.

161
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,810
Brother Yudishtir.

162
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,880
Enough of it.

163
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,780
You three will not eat
even a single 'laddoo'.

164
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,710
Let Bheem eat
all those 'laddoos'.

165
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,770
Elder brother, they snatched off
four of my 'laddoos'.

166
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,830
How can I manage with
just these many 'laddoos'?

167
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,610
Aren't you aware?
'Glutton' is my other name.

168
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,870
Have them in peace, Bheem.

169
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,800
Then have some fruits as well.

170
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,740
Here, brother.

171
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,610
We three will eat
half a 'laddoo' each.

172
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,770
If the three of you eat
half a 'laddoo' each

173
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,740
there will still be
half a 'laddoo' left.

174
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,780
Go.
Get that half as well.

175
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,640
Wait, wait.

176
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,640
All three of you
may eat with me.

177
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,610
Sit.

178
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,780
Arjun, Sahadev,
come on.

179
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,550
Brother. Was that love

180
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,630
or an assassination attempt?

181
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,680
I do not understand.

182
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,600
Son Dhritarashtra.

183
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,610
I can tell by your
quivering words

184
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,510
that you are at unrest,
Queen Mother.

185
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,550
But justice isn't necessary to
be as per everyone's comfort.

186
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,470
What you did wasn't justice,
Dhritarashtra.

187
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,510
To be blinded so much
by your love for your son

188
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,510
isn't appropriate.

189
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,550
Are you here to remind me
of my blindness?

190
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,680
No.
I'm here to remind you

191
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,710
that you are a king.

192
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,550
Your foremost responsibility
is towards your subjects.

193
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,710
Whatever happened, wasn't
the subjects' fault at all.

194
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
The fault was your son's.

195
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,610
And it wasn't right to punish
the fishermen for his fault.

196
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,410
Return them to their
rightful place. - Queen Mother

197
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
I have heard that

198
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,610
the fishes in a pond
love that pond so much

199
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
that when the pond dries up,
they die

200
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
rather than leave the pond.

201
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,600
But maybe that's
their helplessness.

202
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,410
But what helplessness causes
your life among the fishermen

203
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,480
to be as fresh
in your memories till date?

204
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,610
Haven't you left that past
behind, Queen Mother?

205
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,410
Today I will give you
an advice, Queen Mother.

206
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,540
Please do ponder over it
being in the role you are in.

207
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,510
Not as a fisherman's daughter.
