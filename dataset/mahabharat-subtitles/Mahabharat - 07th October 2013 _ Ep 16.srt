1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,520
The King of Magadh, Jarasandh

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,720
by having his daughter married
to the Prince of Mathura, Kans

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,550
has surrounded us.

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,800
Now between Magadh
and our kingdom

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,750
there is just one
big kingdom, Panchal.

6
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,790
Its neighbouring kingdoms

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,620
are Virat, Kashi and Kaushal

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,580
and their kings do not have
the might to stop Jarasandh.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,760
But we have
our allies in the South.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,560
The most powerful kingdom
in the south is Vidarbha.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,730
But Vidarbha is an ally

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,760
of Magadh.
- Pandu

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,630
when you set out
on your victory march

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,740
you shall face hostility
from many kings.

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,770
If you do not do so

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,810
Jarasandh will
deem you powerless

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,710
and attack our kingdom
some day or the other.

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,560
Greetings, grandsire.

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,800
May you live long.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,800
Greetings, Kripacharya.
- May you live long.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,660
Greetings, Queen Mother.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,800
All of you are discussing
a very serious topic.

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,680
To dispense sound advice
to the king

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,620
the entire assembly
is present here.

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,810
Greetings, brother.

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,530
We have a pressing problem
at hand, brother.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,740
We need your assistance.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
In other words, does
the king require my services?

29
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,700
Then what was the need to have
grandsire call me here?

30
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,740
I would have been here
even if you had summoned me

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,540
Your Highness.

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,540
I can only request to you,
brother

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,780
but never order you.

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,720
Irrespective of when
the skies thunder

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,600
animals are bound
to run for cover.

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,730
Similarly, the request of a king
is like an order.

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,630
So, tell me, Your Highness.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,590
Have you sentenced me
to the gallows

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,540
or given me life imprisonment?

40
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,720
Son, what are you saying?

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,740
Why would you be punished?

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,570
For my crime of being
the elder brother, Queen Mother.

43
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,760
Being the elder brother
to a king

44
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,720
is no less than a crime.

45
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,760
Listen to me, brother.

46
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,730
Expunge your heart
of bitterness and anger.

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,620
Vidur and I feel...

48
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,590
And even grandsire
and Queen Mother agree

49
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,630
to make you the Prime Adviser
of Hastinapur.

50
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,790
This rank will be above
that of a Chief Minister.

51
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,600
But no such rank exists,
Your Highness.

52
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,730
Will such a rank be formed
only for me?

53
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,680
Even if it is, it is pointless.

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,770
What advice can
a blind man dispense?

55
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,650
The darkness of his vision
clouds his intellect as well.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,670
Am I right, Chief Minister?

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,670
Brother...
- Let it be, Pandu.

58
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,530
Let it be.

59
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,730
When I was a child

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,670
I would cry to see the moon.

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,530
Then mother Ambika would place
a jaggery 'laddoo' in my hand

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,660
and tell me that the 'laddoo'
was better than the moon.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,610
She would say that people
could only see the moon

64
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,720
but I was fortunate enough
to be able to eat the sweet.

65
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,680
I am not a child anymore.

66
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,690
So, I do not
require this 'laddoo'.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
But I do have question
in my mind.

68
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,690
The coronation ceremony is
like a 'yajna'* in the 'shastras'**
* Sacrificial offering.
** Sacred texts.

69
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,630
and righteousness dictates
such a 'yajna'

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
to be performed
only by a married man.

71
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,780
Grandsire

72
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,540
I was denied my right
based on righteousness.

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,570
So... - But brother,
'Shandilya Samhita' says...

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,740
Let it be, Chief Minister.

75
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,720
According to you, righteousness
changes according to situations.

76
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,540
You will quote an unknown
'shastra' to us all now.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,690
But for me,
tradition is righteousness

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,590
and not just the'shastras'.

79
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,610
It is tradition
that one gets one's right

80
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,610
but only after
proving one's competence.

81
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,710
And in our family, we all
have enlisted our competencies

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,570
and Pandu has even proven
the same.

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,630
Do you understand all this,
Chief Minister?

84
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,700
Even I did not
understand anything.

85
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,630
I shall definitely
prove my competence, brother.

86
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,800
If you like you may test me.

87
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,670
Only time tests a person, Pandu.

88
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,780
And I am not time

89
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,720
but only a person
who has to it.

90
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,690
Before performing your duties
as the king, get married

91
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,620
to a maiden, Pandu,
who's progeny

92
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,660
will provide security
to Hastinapur in the future.

93
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,700
Just like the progeny of
the Princess of Gandhar.

94
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,570
Is a devoted wife not
a part of a king's competence

95
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,590
Chief Minster?

96
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,610
Goodbye.

97
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,650
Dhritarashtra has raised a doubt
regarding righteousness.

98
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
What should I answer him?

99
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,550
For the injustice done to him

100
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,690
will he exact revenge
at every step of the way?

101
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,700
Righteousness can never
lead to injustice, Queen Mother.

102
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,810
But in Dhritarashtra's
perspective

103
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,650
what happened to him was unjust.

104
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,710
And even Gandhari's brother
has stayed back.

105
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,740
He seems deceitful
and devious to me, Bhishma.

106
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,770
He is bound to
instigate Dhritarashtra

107
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,630
and make him a rebel.

108
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,760
If two walls are at loggerheads

109
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,690
then the ceiling
is bound to collapse.

110
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,700
If Pandu and Dhritarashtra
go against each other

111
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,540
then the Kuru dynasty
wall fall apart.

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,730
I cannot let this happen.

113
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,720
To keep King Shantanu's kingdom
as an integrated entity

114
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,610
I have gone
through a lot of pain.

115
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,620
Bhishma, we must put an end
to Dhritarashtra's doubt.

116
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,820
Then we should get Pandu
married at the earliest.

117
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,660
Where will we find a maiden

118
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,560
who will bless Hastinapur
with eminent heirs?

119
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,560
Whose sons will secure
the future of Hastinapur.

120
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Whose presence will magnify
the strengths of Pandu.

121
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,670
Where can we find such a maiden?

122
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,590
Princess, why did you
break our arrows?

123
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,690
Did we make a mistake,
Princess Kunti?

124
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,650
It was not a mistake
but a crime.

125
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,570
That deer has a baby.
Did none of you see it?

126
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,570
To snatch its mother
from a child

127
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,420
is the gravest crime.

128
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,690
A child separated
from its mother is not

129
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,450
surrounded by the world
but only fear.

130
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,690
All around it...

131
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,540
The King has sent you a message.

132
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,660
He has asked you to return
to the palace at once.

133
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,530
Why?

134
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,670
The day of your 'swayamvar'
has been decided.

135
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,480
'Swayamvar?'

136
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,450
Greetings, father.

137
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,600
You are back.
Come here.

138
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,560
Father

139
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,680
have you announced
my 'swayamvar' already?

140
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,440
Yes, dear.

141
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,610
With great pride,
I have made this announcement.

142
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,520
You will see,
this 'swayamvar' of yours

143
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,460
will be celebrated
like a festival.

144
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,470
But father...
- No, Kunti.

145
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,430
If the term 'but' is applied
to the beginning of a question

146
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,520
then its answer
is always doubtful.

147
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,650
A good task is never begun with
terms like 'ifs' and 'buts'.

148
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,460
But what if

149
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,640
the heart is filled with fear
while executing that task?

150
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,620
Even then the task
cannot be executed, father.

151
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,560
This is what you had said.

152
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Are you afraid
of the 'swayamvar'?

153
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,580
Why, dear?

154
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,590
With your purity and devotion
you had pleased sage Durvasa.*
Incarnation of Shiva.

155
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,690
Then what are you afraid of,
Kunti?

156
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,630
There...

157
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,510
There is something, father

158
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,670
that keeps
tormenting my heart.

159
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,480
What is it, Kunti?

160
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,680
Only crime
can torment the heart.

161
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,590
And I have complete faith
that my daughter

162
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,650
can never commit a crime.

163
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,440
Something that would
tarnish my reputation

164
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,620
is not something my daughter
is capable of.

165
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,610
Then what keeps tormenting you?

166
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,610
Father...

167
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,670
I had...

168
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,420
After I leave

169
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,460
who will take care of you?

170
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,690
My brother is still a child.
- My dear.

171
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,590
You have taken
enough care of me.

172
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,550
Now you shall worry
only for your husband.

173
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,410
Be calm.
Dream of happier times ahead.

174
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,680
I have complete faith

175
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,620
that the most able man
of this world

176
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,470
the very finest of them all,
will become your husband.

177
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,530
That is why only the best
kingdoms in the region of Arya

178
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,510
have been invited
to the 'swayamvar'.

179
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,030
It is an invitation from
King Kuntibhoj, Queen Mother.

180
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,310
He is organising a 'swayamvar'
for his daughter Kunti.

181
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,260
I think, Queen Mother,
we should accept his invitation.

182
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,080
She is not even
the daughter of King Kuntibhoj.

183
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,120
She is the daughter of
Shurasen of the Yadavas.

184
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,150
King Kuntibhoj has adopted her.

185
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,060
If she is not even a princess

186
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,270
then how can she become
the Queen of Hastinapur?

187
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,070
Queen Mother

188
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,250
a mango sapling is taken
from where it was sown

189
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,180
to another piece of land.

190
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,180
And the new piece of land
makes the mango even sweeter.

191
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,190
This maiden belongs to both
the Yadava and Kunti dynasties

192
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,200
and has their virtues too.

193
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,230
And Queen Mother,
with this marriage

194
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,120
our relations with the kingdoms
of Kunti and Yadava

195
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,140
will get strengthened.

196
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,300
Chief Minister Vidur.

197
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,150
Right now, I have no interest in
strengthening our relations.

198
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,140
Right now, I am
in search of a maiden

199
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,220
who has the competence
of becoming Hastinapur's Queen.

200
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,310
I have heard that

201
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,090
this maiden had served
Sage Durvasa for months

202
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,050
and her service was such that

203
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,160
even a short-tempered sage like
Durvasa was pleased with her.

204
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,290
A maiden who can perform
such a difficult task

205
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,310
must have the virtues
of patience and righteousness

206
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,030
inside her, Queen Mother.

207
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,150
Princess

208
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,330
what were you about to tell
to His Highness?

209
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,160
That

210
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,070
the daughter whom he
deems to be pure and chaste

211
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,240
has an

212
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,210
unspeakable secret inside her.

213
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,290
It is a secret which, before
the kings of the region of Arya

214
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,210
can humiliate you
and ruin your reputation.

215
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,280
His Highness has
boundless faith in you.

216
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
What will you achieve
by breaking that faith?

217
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,140
That was a mistake in your past.

218
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,150
There is no point
in remembering it.

219
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,170
Please forget about it.

220
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,180
How can I forget about it?

221
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,120
How do I forget about it,
Priyamvada?

222
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,250
Even today, that memory

223
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,050
sends chills down my spine.

224
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,050
I am very pleased with
your service, Princess Kunti.

225
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,050
Before I release you
from my service

226
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,220
I, sage Durvasa,
give you a mantra

227
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,220
with which you will be
able to invoke any God

228
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,210
and call him to you

229
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,330
and shall be blessed with a son
by that God.

230
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,270
Thank you, sire.

231
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,260
I accept your invitation, Kunti.

232
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,270
Are...

233
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,240
Are you Lord Surya himself?
- Yes, Kunti.

234
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,110
Greetings.

235
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,310
This mantra is the order
of Sage Durvasa himself.

236
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,150
When you chant this mantra
while taking the name of a God

237
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,250
that God will be
compelled to appear before you.

238
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,100
Then how did I not get burnt?

239
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,100
I have regulated my temperature
according to you, Kunti.

240
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,130
The son you are
about to conceive

241
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,200
will similarly have

242
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,110
my energy and luminescence.

243
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,210
Son?
