1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,520
If your daughter was born
to become a queen

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,490
then she might just
turn a 'Brahmin'

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,460
into a King.

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,590
Kings and spectators
present here

5
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,550
not all dreams are realised
in this world.

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,460
But a resolution never fails.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,520
If a person makes a resolution

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,460
then in some form
or through a medium

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,690
it certainly gets realized.

10
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,450
To have my daughter
married to the

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,490
most competent warrior
of the world

12
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,620
is my resolution

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,490
and it shall
indeed be fulfilled!

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,550
I address the 'Brahmins'
present here

15
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,690
and if there is a competent
person amongst them

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,650
then he must come forth.

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,550
Did you see...
Did you see that, Pateshwar?

18
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,420
I came here and the King

19
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,390
opened this competition
to the 'Brahmins.'

20
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,430
This is certainly a sign.

21
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,520
Be quiet, Batukeshwar.

22
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,430
Just because Lord Parashuram
is a 'Brahmin'

23
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,450
it does not mean that
all 'Brahmins' are like him.

24
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,530
How can 'Brahmins' win
such a difficult competition?

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,580
We will be insulted.

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,360
Pateshwar, there is
no insult in trying.

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,580
You five brothers seem mighty.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,550
One of you should go there
and give it a try.

29
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,290
Brother Yudhishthir

30
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,490
it is not right for us
to stay here.

31
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,360
The gaze of all the spectators
is upon the 'Brahmins.'

32
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,420
If brother Duryodhan
recognizes us then...

33
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,460
We should go from here,
brother Yudhishthir.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
You are correct, Arjun.

35
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,520
Let's go.

36
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,290
What is this foolishness
being exhibited

37
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,320
by King Drupad?

38
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,380
When we mighty 'Kshatriyas'
could not achieve this task

39
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,360
then how can these 'Brahmins'
achieve the same?

40
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,490
Where are you going,
young 'Brahmins?'

41
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,450
Despite having the capability
to win the competition

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,360
leaving the gathering must also

43
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,450
be termed competence!

44
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,290
But such competence
is of no use to anyone.

45
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,490
Turning one's back to actions

46
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,490
must also be termed excellence.

47
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,460
But does such excellence

48
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,390
help the world gain
anything, 'Brahmins?'

49
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,460
To think only of one's joy,
sorrow and oath

50
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,390
and not of one's duty
towards the world

51
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,360
is utter selfishness.

52
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,290
But a truly competent person

53
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,320
can never be selfish.

54
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,320
Even when a lion is done
devouring its prey

55
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,380
it leaves a good amount of it
for other carnivores.

56
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,350
Is such altruistic behaviour

57
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,360
not the basis of
righteousness, 'Brahmins?'

58
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,220
Think about it.

59
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,180
If you have true competence

60
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,160
then come forth.

61
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,320
The welfare of the world is
connected to this competition

62
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,120
and possibly

63
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,320
your welfare may also
be connected to it.

64
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,120
Your friend Vasudev

65
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,320
not only invoked but also
assured you, Arjun.

66
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,290
You cannot back out now.

67
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,160
If Krishna has said it
then it must be correct.

68
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,150
Go on, Arjun.

69
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,220
May you be victorious.

70
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,120
Even seekers of alms

71
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,190
have been filled with the zeal
to display their might.

72
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,960
When such people only know
how to hold a bowl for alms

73
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,220
then how can they lift a bow?

74
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,020
Go back, 'Brahmin.'

75
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,180
If you try to lift the bow

76
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,120
then you will lose even
the last drop of your dignity.

77
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,090
Think of Lord Parashuram
and move forth!

78
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,980
The gurus who teach people
the art of weaponry

79
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,020
are 'Brahmins.'

80
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,120
Then you need not be scared,
young man. Move forth.

81
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,990
Our blessings are with you.

82
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,120
May you be victorious.

83
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,960
You are indeed Prince Arjun.

84
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Lord Shiva has given me the sign

85
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,020
that this competition
is solely for you, Prince.

86
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,090
You will indeed be successful.

87
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,120
King Drupad, do accept
my greetings.

88
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,990
Vasudev Krishna

89
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,080
do accept my greetings.

90
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,050
Princess Shikhandini

91
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,020
and Princes Draupadi

92
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,860
I bow before you.

93
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,890
Look! He is bowing before
Princess Draupadi!

94
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,980
Every woman

95
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,990
is a form of Goddess Durga.

96
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,930
One who does not respect women

97
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,030
has no competence.

98
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,890
If you accidentally get married
to the Princess, 'Brahmin'

99
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,750
then what will you do?

100
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,050
Will you accept the Princess
as your wife

101
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,860
or establish her in a temple?

102
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,980
Every home is a temple,
Crown Prince Rukmi.

103
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,050
And the wife...

104
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,950
The wife is the deity
of the temple.

105
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,820
I assure you

106
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,950
that I bow before
your sister Rukmini

107
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,790
every single day.

108
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,860
Move forth, young 'Brahmin.'

109
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,990
Let's see if the values
imparted to you

110
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,830
have given you the
adequate strength or not.

111
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,310
All hail the great 'Brahmin!'

112
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,380
All hail the great 'Brahmin!'

113
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,180
All hail the great 'Brahmin!'

114
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,210
All hail the great 'Brahmin!'

115
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,310
All hail the great 'Brahmin!'

116
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,080
All hail the great 'Brahmin!'

117
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,210
King Drupad

118
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,380
I, Patukeshwar Sharma,
hail from Panchapuri

119
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,210
and I brought them
to the'swayamvar.'

120
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,250
Now, you must reward me
handsomely, King Drupad.

121
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,150
They are my friends.
My friends.

122
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,250
A 'Brahmin' won!
He won!

123
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,240
All hail Mahadev!

124
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,080
All hail Mahadev!

125
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,250
Princess, place the garland
around his neck this instant

126
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,250
otherwise I shall have my
granddaughter married to him.

127
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Arjun.
