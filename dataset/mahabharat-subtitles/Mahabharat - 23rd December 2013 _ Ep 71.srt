1
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,990
Brother Balaram!*
*Krishna's older brother, and so Arjun's cousin.

2
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,130
Aren't you Arjun?

3
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,220
Greetings, Bahrain!

4
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,250
Bless you.

5
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,180
Charioteer,
proceed in that direction!

6
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Arjun!

7
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,120
Don't stop Rukmi.

8
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,990
Let him realize his destiny.

9
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,030
Faster!

10
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,990
Krishna!

11
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,030
Stop!
Stop fleeing like a thief!

12
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,950
Stop and fight me!

13
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,990
Welcome!

14
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,990
Welcome, brother-in-law Rukmi

15
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,130
and do accept my greetings

16
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,050
for the second time.

17
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,960
You scoundrel! Rukmini was
to marry Prince Shishupal!

18
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,900
Aren't you ashamed to run away
with someone else's property?

19
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,880
Goddess Lakshmi blesses
people with property

20
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
but she isn't
a property herself.

21
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Similarly, every woman is the
embodiment of Goddess Lakshmi.

22
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,920
A woman has the power to
bless people with property.

23
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,880
Quit rambling, Krishna!

24
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,780
Pick up your weapon!

25
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,820
Why do you wish
to be defeated, Rukmi?

26
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Go back and convey
to the King of Vidarbha

27
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,970
that his daughter and son-in-law
have sent their greetings.

28
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,870
Rukmini!

29
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,870
I order you to
get in my chariot!

30
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,010
No, brother. Henceforth,
all the roads of my life

31
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,020
lead to Dwaraka.

32
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,820
Pardon me, brother.
- Rukmini!

33
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,910
If you don't come along with me,
I will take your corpse with me!

34
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,750
Brother, I am now
in the shelter of Krishna.

35
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Now, Lord Yama* himself cannot kill me.
*God of death.

36
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,950
Quit being stubborn
and go back, brother.

37
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,870
Listen to your sister, Rukmi.

38
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,880
Go back.
- Rukmini

39
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,880
you have insulted your brother
because of that man.

40
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,950
But he shall not
be with you forever!

41
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,720
You and he will be separated!

42
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,680
Do remember! You shall
certainly get separated!

43
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,540
Did you feel nothing
in your heart

44
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,800
while uttering such harsh
words about your sister?

45
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,670
I shall kill you for this
impudence of yours!

46
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,500
No, My Lord!
He is my brother.

47
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,570
Please don't kill him, My Lord.

48
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,600
But I shall
certainly punish him.

49
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,590
Greetings, Madhav.

50
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,400
What do you plan to do next?
- Plan?

51
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,460
My plan is quite simple, friend.

52
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,600
On the coast of Saurashtra
lies the city of Madhavpur

53
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,500
where Rukmini and I
are to be married.

54
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,300
We shall get married there
and after that...

55
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,490
After that, righteousness
will be re-established in India

56
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,330
unrighteous people will be slain

57
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,430
and the entire Aryan region
will be gifted with happiness.

58
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,440
That's it.

59
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,440
And will your marriage
accomplish all this, Madhav?

60
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,360
If not mine but yours might
just accomplish it, friend.

61
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,270
But you should be
prepared for it.

62
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,330
The course of time
can change because of you.
