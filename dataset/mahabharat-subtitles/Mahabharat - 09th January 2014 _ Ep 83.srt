1
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,770
King Drupad

2
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,710
the deities of this 'yajna'
will fulfill your wishes.

3
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,580
Your fate and the betterment
of the Aryan region's future

4
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,550
lies with the children
born from this 'yajna.'

5
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,570
What happened, Arjun?

6
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,580
There is someone in the bushes,
brother Yudhishthir.

7
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,410
I think, an animal
is proceeding towards us.

8
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,480
Greetings.

9
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,380
Who are you and what has
reduced you to this condition?

10
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,370
We hail from Panchal.

11
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,310
The King of Panchal, Drupad,
had imprisoned us.

12
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,250
We have fled from his captivity.

13
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,110
Do begin.

14
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,350
Sages, do accept
my heartfelt apologies.

15
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,140
No

16
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,280
you need not apologize.

17
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,140
We were terrified.

18
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,310
Hence, we were in hiding.

19
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,300
Though sages should not
get frightened

20
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,210
but when a mighty person

21
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,140
tortures people, fear becomes

22
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,140
a part of
a weak person's nature.

23
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,270
Who torture sages
in this region?

24
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,300
This is a grave sin.

25
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,140
The King of Panchal, Drupad.

26
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,110
But he is not at fault.

27
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,180
When anger and greed

28
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
take over a person's heart

29
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,070
righteousness

30
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,170
is the first virtue
to be expunged.

31
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,170
The fire of his insult
is burning him.

32
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,200
A son who can behead Drona

33
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,240
is what he is asking for.

34
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,180
And His Highness also wishes
to defeat the sons of Pandu.

35
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,270
In order to defeat
the five Pandavas

36
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,140
he is asking for just one son?

37
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Did he get such a son?

38
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,940
We were unable to perform
such a 'yajna'

39
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,100
but the great sages Yaja
and Upayaja saved us.

40
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,100
By sacrificing all the merits
they had earned

41
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,170
they have asked for a son
from the Almighty for Drupad.

42
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,040
At the moment, such a 'yajna'
is being performed in Kampilya.

43
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,050
The Gods are pleased with
your sacrifices, King Drupad.

44
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,980
It is now time for
the fulfillment of your wishes.

45
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,340
It is now time for
the fulfillment of your wishes.

46
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,280
Ask for the kind of son
your heart has been

47
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,310
dying to have, King Drupad.

48
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,270
A son is one

49
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,410
who deems the ambitions
of his father as his fate.

50
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,270
By sacrificing my sword,
I ask for a son

51
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,300
whose anger is
as sharp as a sword!

52
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,340
By sacrificing my armour,
I ask for a son

53
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,300
whose pride

54
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,140
is indestructible
like an armour!

55
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,050
By sacrificing my blood, I ask

56
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,040
for a son

57
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,170
whose entire being
is laced with vengeance!

58
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,010
I wish for a son

59
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,240
who will behead Drona
and place his head at my feet!

60
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,420
King Drupad

61
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,420
'dhrishta' means steady

62
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,510
and 'dyumna' means light.

63
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,540
His glory will be everlasting

64
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,510
and you have been blessed
with such a son

65
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,520
by the Gods!

66
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
His name will be Dhrishtadyumna!

67
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,420
My son Dhrishtadyumna!

68
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,390
My son Dhrishtadyumna!

69
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
My son Dhrishtadyumna!

70
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,480
Give me your blessings, father

71
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,380
so that I follow your orders

72
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,250
and be prepared to even
sacrifice my life.

73
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,180
May you live long.

74
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,210
May you be invincible!

75
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,480
Come and embrace your father.

76
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,380
My son Dhrishtadyumna.

77
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,380
But why did all of you
not perform such a 'yajna?'

78
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,410
We do not have as much merits
as great sages Yaja and Upayaja.

79
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,380
We would not have been
able to give a son to Drupad

80
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,150
who is not destined to be his.

81
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,270
He is destined to have
only a daughter.

82
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,190
What do you mean?
- Great sage Upayaja had said

83
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,380
she will change
not only the fate of Panchal

84
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,380
but also that of
the entire Aryan region.
