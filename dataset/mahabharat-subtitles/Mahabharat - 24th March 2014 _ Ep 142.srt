1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,360
In order to

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,330
prove himself as the most
powerful man in Aryavart

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,200
this deceptive Krishna
has conspired.

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,240
Couldn't the greatest
of the great warriors

5
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,330
Bhishma be honoured?

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,200
Then why was Krishna
honoured?

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,390
Sishupal

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,270
I have no objections with

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,270
Vasudeva being felicitated.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,390
Then why are you arguing
for no reason?

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,240
Why would you have
a problem, Bhishma?

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,270
After all, you are incompetent.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,260
You have gone to
the extent of stealing girls

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,270
for your Princes.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,230
Sishupala

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,260
are you keeping a count
of your sins?

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,360
Only 100!

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,200
I will forgive only
100 of your sins

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,270
as promised to your mother.

20
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,330
And before you came here

21
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,400
you have committed many sins.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,190
Keep quiet, wicked man.

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,330
You're a lewd man

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,170
who marries
the wives of other men.

25
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,170
You married 16,000

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,170
of Narkasur's wives.

27
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,170
Everybody here knows

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,130
about your lewdness.

29
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,360
At Brindavan, you would
stand on one leg

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,170
and play the flute and perform
the dance of divine love.

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,100
We are all aware of that!

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,330
Radha was married
to Ayan Yadav.

33
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,260
Yet you trapped that
innocent girl

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,300
in your endearing
infatuation.

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,220
Has it slipped your mind?

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,260
Have you forgotten?

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,270
You are the world's most
immoral being, Krishna.

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,290
Quieten down, Sishupla.

39
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,030
Don't walk so blindly on
this sinful path

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,130
that you're unable to keep
count of those sins.

41
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,330
I am well aware of what
I'm doing, Krishna.

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,070
And I also know why
you're being honoured.

43
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,070
This is another evidence
of your lewdness.

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,260
Definitely, Draupadi

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,100
must have told her
incapable husbands

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,100
that you should be given
the greatest of honours.

47
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,100
You call her your friend,
don't you?

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,000
Friend!

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,000
How can a married woman

50
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,140
be friends with a man?

51
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,200
All of us know what relationship
you and...

52
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,130
It's time for you

53
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,930
to quieten down, Sishupal.

54
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,970
May your soul

55
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,030
rest in peace.

56
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,030
What sordid justice is
this, brother Yudhishthir?

57
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,060
How can killing a guest
like this

58
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,840
be considered appropriate?

59
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,830
After becoming
the mighty sovereign

60
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,060
is this how you're going
to establish righteousness

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,800
in the whole of Aryavart?

62
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Calm down, Duryodhan.
Sishupal insulted grandsire

63
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,030
Vasudeva

64
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,970
and my father.

65
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,060
He disrespected my authority.

66
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,930
He also insulted daughter-in-law
of the Kuru dynasty, Rukmini

67
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,830
and also queen Draupadi.

68
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,860
He got the punishment
he deserved.

69
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,060
Yudhishthir

70
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,060
punishment can never
exceed the crime.

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,870
The punishment must always
be lesser than the crime.

72
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,990
You can humiliate someone
as a punishment for an insult.

73
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,800
How can you kill him?

74
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,930
Sin and crime are part of
a poisonous cycle, Prince.

75
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,930
If the criminal is not stopped
from committing a crime

76
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,970
he will go on to commit
many crimes.

77
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,860
He goes on to pollute his soul.

78
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,890
He loses control over himself.

79
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,770
He continues to
commit crimes

80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
even without reason.

81
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,830
The way

82
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,770
an infant is forcefully stopped

83
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,860
from consuming sand

84
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,760
in the same manner

85
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,770
it is necessary

86
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,790
to stop a criminal

87
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,990
from committing crimes.

88
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,870
That's not a punishment, Prince.

89
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
It's sympathy!

90
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Don't unnecessarily worry
about Sishupal.

91
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,800
He has been freed
from this poisonous cycle.

92
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,900
Don't try to fool me,
Vasudeva Krishna.

93
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,840
You have taken revenge in
the name of punishment.

94
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,860
You have violated
this yajna.

95
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,820
My dear

96
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,770
Vasudeva is right.

97
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
Be seated.
- Keep quiet, uncle.

98
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,830
Prince Sishupal was my friend.

99
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,930
We had sworn to
protect each other.

100
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,900
If I don't avenge
his death today

101
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,790
then my being
a warrior

102
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,760
will be questioned, uncle.

103
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,690
Vasudeva Krishna

104
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,900
I challenge you to a duel.

105
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
My dear, Vasudeva is right.

106
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,760
Be seated.
Please be seated...

107
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Brother Duryodhan,
don't degrade the sanctity

108
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,090
of Indraprastha
by shedding your blood.

109
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,890
I don't forgive anyone
who dares to raise

110
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,970
a weapon against Madhav.

111
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,760
Brother Arjun...

112
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,800
If this is the beginning
of the battle

113
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,030
then I accept it.

114
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,990
Prince Duryodhan...

115
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,860
Before fighting the battle,
it is mandatory

116
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,000
to take the permission

117
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,790
of the King of Hastinapur,
Dhritarashtra.

118
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,770
But the king of Hastinapur

119
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,900
isn't present here, Minister.

120
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,800
The minister of Hastinapur
is present though!

121
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,760
You can indeed call for
a verbal duel with Vasudev.

122
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,920
But you can't use weapons

123
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,030
in somebody else's court.

124
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,800
I order you

125
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,830
to either put down
your weapon

126
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,770
or step down from
the post of Hastinapur's prince.

127
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,830
Else, I'll have to give orders

128
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,830
to Hastinapur's
Army General, Bhishm

129
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,830
to raise weapons
for protecting Indraprastha.

130
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,820
Brother Duryodhan

131
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,930
I request you
to put your weapons down.

132
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,750
My child...

133
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,730
My child...

134
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,700
Don't be foolish.

135
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,830
Destiny defeats the one

136
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,870
who has no control
over one's anger

137
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,700
even before anyone else

138
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,860
defeats them.

139
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,800
Drop your weapons.

140
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,670
This is not enough.

141
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,820
Your Highness

142
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
the one who has raised weapons
in your court

143
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,700
should certainly be punished.

144
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,730
To strengthen the confidence
of all the kings present here

145
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,670
on your just nature,
it's compulsory

146
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,690
that Prince Duryodhan
be punished.

147
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,690
I forgive brother Duryodhan.

148
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,700
Your Highness, punish him!

149
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,560
Yes, punish him!

150
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,860
Your Highness, punish him!

151
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,690
Yes, punish him!

152
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,630
Your Highness, punish him!

153
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,860
Yes, punish him!

154
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,600
Your Highness,
those who spit at the sky

155
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,630
make their own face dirty.

156
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,720
The sky doesn't forgive
but punishes them.

157
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,720
Similarly

158
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,830
you can't forgive
Prince Duryodhan

159
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,720
for his mistake.

160
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,830
Even Arjun
was punished, brother.

161
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,790
Whereas he had only tried

162
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,760
to protect the honour
of Panchali.

163
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,830
But how should I punish him?

164
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,600
Duryodhan is my brother.

165
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,600
By punishing him, I can't

166
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,820
hurt uncle.

167
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,650
Your Highness...

168
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,570
Destiny paves its own path.

169
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,790
Don't worry.

170
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,670
Just decide on the punishment.

171
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,460
Your Highness...

172
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,720
Shall I say something?

173
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,670
I don't see any reason
why we should hurt uncle

174
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,600
and her highness, by punishing
brother-in-law Duryodhan.

175
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,700
But Govind is insisting
on giving him punishment.

176
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,720
Then, Your Highness

177
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,460
it's considered
punishment enough

178
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,600
to sieze the weapons
of a warrior.

179
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,530
Order brother-in-law Duryodhan

180
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,500
to give up his weapon.

181
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,840
Order brother-in-law Duryodhan

182
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,810
to give up his weapon.

183
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,870
With due respect

184
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,770
we'll send his weapon
to Hastinapur.

185
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,780
How dare you decide
punishment for me

186
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,640
Draupadi!

187
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,650
Don't try to humiliate me!

188
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,580
Don't take it as humiliation,
brother-in-law.

189
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,580
This is a solution to the conflict
that has arisen in the family.

190
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,810
And it's an attempt to eliminate
the taint that was tossed

191
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,750
on your clothes
as well as your heart.

192
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,580
You possess a tainted character
yourself

193
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,650
and you worry about
my clothes?

194
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,720
Control your tongue, Duryodhan!

195
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,650
Brother Duryodhan,
it's my order

196
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,770
that within the boundaries
of Indraprastha

197
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,750
you're not allowed
to hold your weapon.

198
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,770
Bheem, Arjun, Sahdev

199
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,620
seize the weapons
from brother Duryodhan

200
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,670
brother Dushasan
and from the King of Anga.

201
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,750
Prince Duryodhan,
hand over your weapons.

202
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,510
This is my order.

203
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,610
Your Highness, the punishment

204
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
for raising weapons
in the court is death.

205
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,670
Grant me
the same punishment.

206
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,680
Whether or not
there's blood shed

207
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,510
how does it make a difference,
King of Anga?

208
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,750
Consider this to be equivalent
to death penalty.

209
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,740
Come on, hand over
your bow to me.
