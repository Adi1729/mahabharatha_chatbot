1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,260
But brother Arjun

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,200
if you leave the city

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,270
then there will be
no Rajsuya 'Yajna.'

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,330
Sahadev

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,290
if the cows are
not brought back safely

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,400
then there will be
no reverence of the city.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,170
We need those one lakh cows

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,170
for the reverence of the city.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,360
But brother, think
about the future as well.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,300
How will you live by yourself
for so many years?

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,360
And in the meantime,
without your protection

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,330
what will become
of Indraprastha, brother?

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,390
Duties build the future,
Sahadev

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,300
and not the other way around.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,270
And how can you be worried about
the future of Indraprastha?

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,300
You can see the future,
can you not?

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,290
No one can ever see
the future clearly, brother.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,340
But I have a bad feeling

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,200
that Indraprastha is
far from attaining peace.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,300
Something disastrous
is going to happen here.

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,320
And at a time like this

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,200
if the city is
not protected by you then...

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,340
Please let me go get the cows!

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,220
Sahadev!

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,340
Takshak is an
illusory being, Sahadev.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,360
You do not even have the weapons
bestowed by the Gods.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
You will not be able
to defeat Takshak.

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,340
I have to do this.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,230
We need to conduct the
reverence of the city soon.

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,360
We must ensure that brother
Yudhishthir becomes King soon!

31
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,270
But think about his situation
as well, brother.

32
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,360
When he finds out

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,360
that you have made such a
big sacrifice to make him King

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,170
what will his state
of mind be, brother?

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,130
Had we been five

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,070
this would have been
my sacrifice for him.

37
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,240
But we are one,
Sahadev.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,100
I am making
this sacrifice for myself.

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,070
Let me go, Sahadev.
- No, brother.

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,030
I can go to Panchali's chamber

41
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,170
and get the Gandiva for you.

42
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,130
I shall perform this penance.

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,070
Wise men say that when
one is altruistic with food

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,270
and selfish with penance

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,300
only then does
one's body and soul

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,090
stay healthy.

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,200
Let me be selfish today.

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,060
What could have happened

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,130
that My Lord had to
break his oath?

50
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,030
What happened,
Sahadev?

51
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Brother Yudhishthir

52
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,990
Takshak stole the cows
coming here from Hastinapur.

53
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,070
Brother Arjun
has gone after him.

54
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,060
Nakul, the venom needs to be
drawn out of the soldiers.

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Go and wake the serpents up.

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,060
Brother Bheem,
brother Arjun has said that you

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,090
must make arrangements
to protect the city.

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's go, Nakul.

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,070
Bheem, I shall come with you.

60
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,970
'The serpents
shown in this scene'

61
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,900
'were generated
using computer graphics.'

62
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,860
No serpent can ever escape
the circle of fire, Takshak.

63
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,700
If you are willing
to take my refuge

64
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,730
then I shall
extinguish the fire.

65
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,900
Take your refuge!

66
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,930
The refuge of a human?

67
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,830
No.

68
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,670
Shoot me with your arrow,
son of Pandu.

69
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,830
Kill me.

70
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,670
I cannot do that.

71
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,800
I have taken the oath
of not killing serpents.

72
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,790
But until you give into fatigue

73
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,740
and accept your defeat

74
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,830
I shall fight you.

75
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,760
I accept my defeat at the moment

76
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,600
son of Pandu.

77
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,700
Take your cows with you.

78
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,630
But our enmity
has not ended yet.

79
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Today, if

80
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,670
you do not kill me

81
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,600
then do remember

82
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,790
that I

83
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,630
shall certainly be back

84
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,730
to have my revenge.

85
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,600
Certainly.

86
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,800
I shall be waiting.

87
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,280
We had taken an oath,
brother Yudhishthir.

88
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,240
I had entered

89
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,470
Panchali's chamber
without her permission.

90
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I must resort to asceticism now

91
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,300
and perform an austere penance.

92
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,310
Arjun

93
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,180
I am the eldest son
of King Pandu.

94
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,370
Yet, history shall deem you
the hero amongst the Pandavas.

95
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,180
Give me your blessings,
brother Yudhishthir

96
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,440
to have appreciation
in my penance.

97
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,170
May your penance

98
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,380
experience

99
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,180
knowledge and competence

100
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,370
always meet with
appreciation, Arjun.

101
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,330
Bless you!

102
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,270
If you do go southward

103
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,140
then you must certainly go to Saurasen's kingdom.*
*Surasena, present-day Braj region in Uttar Pradesh.

104
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,110
I have heard that the food there

105
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,270
is the tastiest in the
entire Aryan region!

106
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,170
Brother Bheem

107
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,340
I am going to perform a penance.

108
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,300
I will consume bland food

109
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,240
and lead a controlled life.

110
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,300
Do not say that, brother.

111
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
I will start crying.

112
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,200
How can food
hamper one's penance?

113
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,110
We shall meet very soon, friend.

114
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,240
Where will you go
to perform the penance?

115
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,170
Manipur* in the East
*A state in northeastern India, with the city of Imphal as its capital.

116
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,080
and even Pragjyotishpur* are quite famous places.
*Pragjyotishpura, now Guwahati.

117
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,150
I wish to see those regions.

118
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,230
You may certainly go there.

119
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,100
But after you are
done travelling

120
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,070
you must come
to the city near Dwaraka

121
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,170
to perform your penance in the Somnath Temple.*
*Located in the Prabhas Kshetra, western coast of Gujarat, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines of the god Shiva.

122
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,270
Chandra* had been blessed with a new life there.
*The Lunar deity Soma (lit. "juice"), the juice of sap in the plants and thus makes the Moon the lord of plants and vegetation.

123
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,140
Possibly

124
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,080
you might just
find something there.

125
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,180
And that may complete
your penance.

126
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,010
As you say, Madhav.

127
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,200
Pardon me, Panchali.

128
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,080
Before taking
such a major decision

129
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,170
I could not seek
your permission.

130
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
You have taken the correct
decision, My Lord.

131
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,940
Your experience

132
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,110
will benefit our kingdom.

133
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,170
And I...

134
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,170
And I shall benefit from
the lesson of patience.

135
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
May there be appreciation
in your penance, My Lord.

136
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,420
Handmaidens.

137
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,350
'This life, this world'

138
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:36,360
'are all games
of time and tide.'

139
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,450
'What is bound to happen,
happens'

140
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:51,360
'and by its rules
we must abide.'

141
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,520
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

142
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,490
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

143
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,420
'Joy and sorrow
are parts of life.'

144
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,390
'Only that happens
what is destined.'

145
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,420
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

146
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,250
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

147
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,450
'Duties are more
important than life.'

148
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,510
'Actions are more important
than the amenities of life.'

149
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,320
'It is impossible to know
what fate has decided.'

150
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,260
'Once again, life
in the woods lies ahead.'

151
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,450
'The blissful life of a palace'

152
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,390
'must once again be sacrificed.'

153
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,450
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

154
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,280
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

155
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,410
If I am a dedicated
and faithful wife

156
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,260
then no stone
or pebble in your path

157
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,290
will ever hurt you.
