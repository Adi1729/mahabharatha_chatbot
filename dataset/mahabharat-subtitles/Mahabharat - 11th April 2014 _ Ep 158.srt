1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
Sister-in-law!

2
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,790
Sister-in-law,
what...

3
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,830
What happened in Hastinapur?!

4
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,980
Sister-in-law...

5
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,850
Sister-in-law!

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,950
Sister-in-law!

7
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,930
Do not embrace me,
Subhadra!

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,790
You will burn up.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,750
I was housed within
a fire back then

10
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,730
but now, a fire
is burning within me!

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,750
I do not wish to see anyone!

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,890
No one!

13
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,660
Sister-in-law.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,660
Sister-in-law!

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,750
Open the door, sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law!

16
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,730
Sister-in-law!
Open the door, sister-in-law!

17
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,730
Sister-in-law!
Open the door, sister-in-law!

18
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,890
Sister-in-law!

19
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,720
My Lord!

20
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,790
How could you let something
so dreadful happen, My Lord?

21
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,590
Sister-in-law has locked
herself up in her chamber.

22
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,750
Sister-in-law has said that
she wishes to see no one.

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,650
I made numerous attempts but
she refuses to open the door.

24
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,790
Panchali,
open the door!

25
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,700
Give me the opportunity
for reparation, Panchali.

26
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,650
Open the door!

27
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,690
Brother Yudhishthir

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,560
Panchali is
exceedingly agitated.

29
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,820
I hope she does not
set herself on fire.

30
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,620
Brother Yudhishthir,
let me break the door down.

31
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,790
Impossible...
Impossible!

32
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,750
I can even break stone castles
down with my might

33
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,690
but why am I unable to break
this wooden door, brother?

34
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,690
Panchali's resolution has
locked that door, brother

35
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,590
and breaking the resolution
of a heart in agony

36
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,760
is way more difficult
than breaking a castle.

37
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,650
This is Panchali's resolution,
brother.

38
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,530
Open the door,
Panchali!

39
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,690
Panchali,
open the door.

40
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,490
Brother Yudhishthir

41
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,490
we will not be able
to get her to open that door.

42
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,600
Only Madhav can
have it opened now.

43
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Greetings, brother.

44
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
Greetings...

45
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,500
I cannot accept your greetings
at the moment, Prince Arjun.

46
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,550
Until Draupadi
pardons all of you

47
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,660
I cannot pardon you either.

48
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,620
Where is my friend?

49
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,660
She left the court
of Hastinapur immediately

50
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,530
and came to Indraprastha

51
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,490
all by herself

52
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,630
leaving all of us behind.

53
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,550
She has locked herself up
in her chamber, brother.

54
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,650
All of us made numerous attempts

55
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,620
but she refuses to open
the doors of her chamber.

56
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,420
She has closed the doors
of her heart, Subhadra.

57
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,520
How can she open the doors
of her chamber then?

58
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,390
Panchali

59
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,460
friends are those

60
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,490
who share the feelings
of their hearts.

61
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,350
I too have a share to the
agony of your heart, friend.

62
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,300
I am here to have
my share of the agony.

63
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,520
Go away,
Govind.

64
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,450
I have been tarnished.

65
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,300
The one who tries to clean this
will also become dirty.

66
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,460
Have faith

67
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,350
in my friendship,
friend.

68
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,390
A person bathing
in the river gets cleansed

69
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,490
but this does not
leave the river dirty.

70
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,490
Govind!

71
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Why, Govind?
Why?

72
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,420
Why did this happen to me?

73
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,420
Such a grave insult!

74
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,160
What sins did I commit,
Govind?

75
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,330
I am reaping the fruits
for which actions of mine?

76
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,200
Whatever happened,
friend

77
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,320
was neither because
of your actions

78
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,250
nor did you reap the fruits
of any action of yours.

79
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,390
That was merely
an unexpected event.

80
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,320
The Kauravas reaped the fruits
of their past actions

81
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,160
by engaging in
such a grave misdeed.

82
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,150
Friend, this is the meaning
of the principle of actions.

83
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,090
A good deed

84
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,350
leads to a better one

85
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,130
while a bad deed

86
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,090
leads to worse deeds
one after the other.

87
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,290
The life of a person
who commits misdeeds

88
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,330
becomes hell,
friend.

89
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,230
But I am experiencing
the agony, Govind.

90
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,230
Then relinquish
that agony, friend.

91
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,310
But I am experiencing
the agony, Govind.

92
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,210
Then relinquish
that agony, friend.

93
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,150
What happened with you
back in Hastinapur

94
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,120
was not because of your actions.

95
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,310
However, the way you will
transform the forthcoming events

96
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,280
will certainly be
your own actions.

97
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,150
If you fill your heart

98
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,140
with sorrow and animosity

99
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,280
then you too

100
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,250
shall experience hell.

101
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,250
However, why should
their misdeeds

102
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,190
make you go through hell?

103
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,280
Relinquish this animosity,
friend.

104
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,190
Calm your heart down.

105
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,020
A river takes all the filth
tossed into it

106
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,020
and pours it into the ocean.

107
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,120
She cleanses herself this way.

108
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,050
You too

109
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,210
need to pour all your agonies
into the hands of the Almighty.

110
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,150
The Almighty is always prepared

111
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,080
to absorb the agonies
of the entire world.

112
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,180
In other words

113
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,020
I must pardon the Kurus
present in the court?

114
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,210
Yes, friend.

115
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,080
Pardon them

116
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,110
otherwise revenge
shall consume you.

117
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,090
You will not be able
to uphold justice.

118
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,020
Revenge,
misdeeds

119
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,140
justice

120
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,120
good deeds...

121
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,080
What is the difference,
Govind?

122
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,050
When they treated the supreme
Empress of the Aryan region

123
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,090
in such a horrendous manner

124
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,020
what will they do to the
ordinary women of the world?

125
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,010
Think about it,
friend.

126
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,120
Try to visualize the pain
of the world in yours.

127
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,180
Transform your sorrows
into a struggle.

128
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,050
Do understand this,
friend.

129
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,150
The one who lets one's
own sorrow consume oneself

130
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,010
becomes weak.

131
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,180
However,
the person

132
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,880
who deems the sorrows
of the society to be his own

133
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,110
becomes strong.

134
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,920
Thinking solely about
one's own sorrow

135
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,090
is a misdeed.

136
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,980
However, looking for a solution
to the problems of the world

137
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,950
is a good deed.

138
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,080
Yes, friend.

139
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,110
I am asking you

140
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,010
to begin first with Duryodhan

141
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,010
and pardon him.

142
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,010
That will be the first step
towards his destruction.

143
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,950
Look for ways to cleanse the
world of evil men like Duryodhan

144
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,090
and others like him.

145
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,820
Not just for yourself

146
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,920
but for the world.

147
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,910
You must fight for the welfare
of the weak men and women

148
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,040
of the society.

149
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,920
In this fight
for humanitarianism

150
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,850
there will be a lot of bloodshed

151
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,820
yet it shall be a righteous war.

152
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,810
So...

153
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,980
Will you be able to do this?

154
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,850
Yes, Govind.

155
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,820
My heart was
filled with darkness

156
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,720
but you have lit the lamp
of knowledge within it.

157
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,950
'The fishes shown in this scene'

158
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,690
'were generated
using computer graphics.'

159
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
Panchali

160
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,560
I threw those dice
with these hands of mine

161
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,730
which reduced my brothers
to the status of servants

162
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,620
and led to the
grave insult of my wife.

163
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,530
Bheem had taken an oath
to burn my hands.

164
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,630
Remember your oath,
Bheem.

165
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,720
Come here

166
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,500
and burn my hands.

167
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,460
No, My Lord.

168
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,530
You need not have
your hands burnt.

169
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,620
I pardon you.

170
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,500
I too must pardon myself,
Panchali

171
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,690
otherwise it will be
impossible for me to live.

172
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,590
Come here,
Vrikodar.

173
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Burn my hands.
