1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,740
Before beginning the competition

2
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,610
I welcome such a guest

3
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,530
whom my old eyes deem

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,690
of having the potential

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,570
of becoming the man
of the millennium

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,570
and ushering a righteous era.

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,610
Welcome, Vasudev Krishna!

8
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,570
The great Yadava,
Vasudev Krishna.

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,560
He is the only person

10
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,630
whom an intelligent person
befriends for life.

11
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,730
Why so, uncle?

12
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,500
Because in the whole of
the Aryan region, he is the one

13
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,670
with whom having any enmity

14
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,540
cannot be afforded by us.

15
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,440
He is way more intelligent

16
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,470
and cunning than me.

17
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,440
Vasudev

18
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,400
I always had
the desire to see you

19
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,390
in my heart.

20
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,340
Greetings, uncle.

21
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,470
You deem me your uncle, Vasudev?

22
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,500
You are the uncle
of my brother Duryodhan.

23
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,510
Hence, I must address you
as my uncle.

24
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,460
No, Vasudev.
No.

25
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,500
I fear in becoming your uncle.

26
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,300
Fear.

27
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,270
Why so, uncle?

28
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I had salvaged my uncle Kansa.*
He imprisoned his own father, Ugrasena (King of Mathura), to usurp the throne; and later imprisoned his sister, Devaki (Krishna's mother) along with Krishna's father, Vasudeva.

29
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,500
I liberated him of his sins.

30
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,340
Greetings, brother Duryodhan.

31
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,430
Bless you, Krishna.

32
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,410
Greetings, Vasudev.
- Bless you, Dusshasan.

33
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,230
And you...

34
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,470
You must certainly be
King Karna of Anga.

35
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,200
By looking at the radiance
on your face

36
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,440
anyone can know
of your competence.

37
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,390
Greetings.

38
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,300
Greetings, Vasudev.

39
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,340
Meeting you is my good fortune.

40
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,270
The whole of the Aryan region
resonates of your righteousness.

41
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,330
Righteousness is such a topic,
King Karna of Anga

42
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,370
that everyone discusses it

43
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,430
but

44
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,240
not everyone can know it.

45
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Then you tell us

46
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,240
what is the path to know
what righteousness is.

47
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,460
Righteousness gives respect,
King of Anga.

48
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,340
If one gets disrespect in
one's life, one must deem

49
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,470
that he did not lead
a righteous life.

50
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,430
And the one

51
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,330
who has got nothing
but disrespect since birth...

52
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,360
What should he do, Vasudev?

53
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
He should struggle for respect

54
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,290
but not side
with unrighteousness.

55
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,240
He must certainly
fight for his rights

56
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,200
but not desire something
over which he has no right.

57
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,330
What do you mean?

58
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,140
It means, King of Anga

59
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,240
that even the biggest
of mountains

60
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,170
must not desire a small river.

61
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,260
The mountain which
tries to stop a river

62
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,200
ends up breaking.

63
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,100
The right to a river

64
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,100
resides only with the ocean.

65
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,100
Are you talking about
the strength of the ocean

66
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,110
or the weakness
of the mountain, Vasudev?

67
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,170
I am talking about the fate
of the river, King of Anga.

68
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,230
Hear all!

69
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,210
The most beautiful
and serendipitous

70
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,130
Yajnaseni,* Princess Draupadi is making her entrance!
*Daughter of fire.

71
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,170
'When I'

72
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,040
'like the light'

73
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,110
'am surrounded by
the joy of knowledge'

74
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,070
'and everything is novel
all around me'

75
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,130
'when should I play'

76
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,210
'oh childhood?'

77
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,070
'Novel are the pictures'

78
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,070
'and the light
of bright colours.'

79
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,040
'Fire is my'

80
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,200
'fate.'

81
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,110
'I am Draupadi, who'

82
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,070
'never experienced childhood.'

83
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,200
'I am Draupadi, whose'

84
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,240
'fate is fire.'

85
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,970
Bless you.

86
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,940
Such a beautiful woman

87
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,070
ought to become
the Queen of Hastinapur, uncle.

88
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,960
Certainly, my dear.
Certainly.

89
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,990
Truly

90
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,130
she has unparalleled beauty.

91
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,900
Do have a look, King of Anga.

92
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,030
Admiring the beauty
of someone else's wife to be

93
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,100
is inappropriate, Dusshasan.

94
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,060
Besides

95
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,070
if the Princess will be
married to friend Duryodhan

96
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,940
she will have the status
of your mother.

97
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,030
You are correct.

98
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,990
Greetings.

99
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
No, friend.

100
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,740
Govind

101
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,930
will Prince Arjun
come to the 'swayamvar?'

102
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Govind

103
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,320
will Prince Arjun
come to the 'swayamvar?'

104
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,260
I have a feeling, Draupadi

105
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,230
that if he does arrive

106
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,200
you shall know about it
before I do.

107
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,200
Splendid!
Instead of giving alms

108
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,160
everyone has gone
to receive charity.

109
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,250
If you do not get any food

110
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,220
what will become of you,
brother Bheem?

111
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
I can even eat
the leaves of a tree

112
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,250
because poison
has no effect on me.

113
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,320
What will become of you, Nakul?

114
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Let's proceed to Kampilya then.

115
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,320
If we stay cautious
no one will recognize us.

116
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,060
No, Sahadev.

117
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,020
There must be another village
here. We should go there.

118
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,190
We must not go to Kampilya.

119
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,250
We have no business being
at the 'swayamvar' there.

120
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,020
Let's proceed.

121
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,090
Hear all!
The son of King Vradyakshen

122
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Susharma, is making his entrance
for the competition!

123
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,990
Hear all!
The son of King Samudrasen

124
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,360
Chandrasen,
is making his entrance

125
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,450
for the competition!

126
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I have firm faith

127
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,370
that there is indeed
a village in this direction.

128
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,370
I see some sages over there.

129
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,440
We should go ask them.

130
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,340
What do you think,
brother Yudhishthir?

131
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,450
L-Let me ask them.
Let me do it.

132
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,410
Greetings, sages.
- Bless you!

133
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,310
In which direction are you
headed, young 'Brahmins?'

134
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,310
We are proceeding
towards Naimisharanya

135
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,240
but before we proceed further

136
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,470
we wish to seek some alms.

137
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,470
That is why, we are
searching for a village.

138
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,470
When the King himself
has engaged in charity

139
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,280
then why do all of you need to
seek alms from the villagers?

140
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,300
Let's proceed towards
the city of Kampilya.

141
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,330
One will be rid of
one's poverty for life.

142
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,210
Let's proceed.
Do come with us.

143
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,470
Revered ones,
we are grateful to you

144
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,280
but we..
- Let all this be

145
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,370
and come with us.

146
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,240
Revered ones

147
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,450
do lead the way
and we shall follow.

148
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,400
Alright. As you wish.
- Alright.

149
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Let's proceed in this direction.

150
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,270
Hear all!

151
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,380
The King of Ushneer, Shivi

152
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,470
is making his entrance
for the competition!

153
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Even that King
got defeated, Vasudev.

154
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,140
I have firm faith

155
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,210
that the capability
to win this competition

156
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,230
lies solely with Arjun.

157
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,310
In the entire Aryan region,
this competition can be won

158
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,370
by two people, Your Highness.

159
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,300
The son of Pandu, Arjun

160
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,140
and

161
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,110
the King of Anga, Karna.

162
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,240
But Vasudev

163
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,070
he is the son of a charioteer.

164
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,110
I never oppose any caste
or creed, King Drupad.

165
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,140
The right to respect

166
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,080
belongs to every
competent person.

167
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,150
I am certainly worried that
he is with unrighteous people

168
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,080
but

169
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,310
we cannot stop him from
taking part in this competition.

170
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,240
However...

171
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,070
if marrying Karna

172
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,100
is not what Draupadi wants

173
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,040
then she can
certainly say no to it.
