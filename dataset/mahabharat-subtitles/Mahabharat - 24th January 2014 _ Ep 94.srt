1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,800
The Lord has ordered

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,730
you to get married
tomorrow at dawn

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,770
to Princess Hidimha.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,790
And after that, we will
make a sacrifice

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,830
and worship the
new King and Queen.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,860
Let's leave, mother.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,600
Brother Yudhishthir,
let's leave.

8
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,790
Why is King Vrikodar so angry?

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,760
Did we make a mistake?

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,600
No, you have made no mistake.

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,660
We chanced upon this place
during our journey.

12
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,830
We did not come here with the
intention of ruling this place.

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,830
If that was the case then
why did you kill our King?

14
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,560
It is our tradition that the one
who kills the King

15
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,590
becomes the next King

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,760
and marries the daughter
or sister of the former King.

17
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,760
If this does not happen,
we will have no King at all.

18
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,500
There will be petty
conflicts amongst us

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,560
and our youth
will become misguided.

20
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,630
Be it humans or ogres

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,690
traditions are
the basis of society.

22
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,670
You have no right to toy
with our traditions.

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,760
Since you have
created this problem

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,660
you must also come up
with a solution.

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,750
Dear

26
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,620
you need not worry.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,670
My son Yudhishthir
is a very intelligent

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,600
and righteous man.

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,620
He will never allow anything bad
to happen to your subjects.

30
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,630
But what will become
of me, My Lady?

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
What about our tradition?

32
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,660
I have accepted your son
whole-heartedly as the King

33
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,490
and as my husband.

34
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,690
The complexion and behaviour
of us ogres

35
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,430
may be different
from that of humans

36
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,720
but the heart

37
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
and the love within it

38
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,690
is same for all beings, My Lady.

39
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,490
But dear

40
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,620
the marriage of an ogre
and a human...

41
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,570
How is that possible?

42
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,600
The great sage Vishwashrava had
also married the ogre Kaikasi.

43
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,460
And they had a son like Ravan.

44
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,590
But they also had
Vibhishan, My Lady.

45
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,530
I promise you

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,630
that I will raise my sons
to be like Vibhishan.

47
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,460
Try to understand
my love, My Lady.

48
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,460
Is receiving clarified butter
either as sacrament or alms

49
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,400
not worthy of acceptance?

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Accepting what is pure

51
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,470
has always been deemed correct.

52
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,660
So say the religious texts
of humans beings.

53
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,430
My love is also pure, My Lady.

54
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,620
Please accept me as your
daughter-in-law.

55
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,430
You are not only
a woman, Hidimba

56
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,570
but also the Queen after
the demise of your brother.

57
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,430
How will you

58
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,430
renounce your subjects?

59
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,330
And my son...

60
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,490
How can he spend
his remaining life

61
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,330
living amongst ogres?

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,520
Hidimba

63
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,460
it would be best
if you forget my son.

64
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,490
Appoint a worthy ogre
as the new King

65
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,390
and work for the welfare
of your subjects.

66
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,460
For a little while, My Lady!

67
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,300
If I can be the wife of
your son for a little while

68
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,360
then I shall spend my whole life
with those memories.

69
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,470
For a little while, My Lady.

70
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,520
Until our first child is born.

71
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,330
That child will become
the King of the Ogres.

72
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,290
I promise you, My Lady!

73
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,400
That after that child is born

74
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I will not ask any of you
to stay even a day longer.

75
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
I promise you this.

76
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,430
You shall earn the merit
of giving alms to a beggar.

77
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,230
You shall earn the merit...

78
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,660
You shall earn the merit
of giving alms to a beggar.

79
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,500
You shall earn the merit...

80
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,590
Get up, dear.

81
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,600
My daughter-in-law

82
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,650
can never ask for alms.

83
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,290
Bring the garlands.

84
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,420
King Vrikodar

85
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,320
place the garland around
the neck of the Princess.

86
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,490
She will refuse
to wear the garland

87
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,390
but if you succeed in doing so

88
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,260
then you shall receive
the blessings of the Lord.

89
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,290
You shall get
only three attempts.

90
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,230
So, go ahead.

91
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,230
This is the first wedding
of the Kuru dynasty.

92
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,460
Had we received
uncle's blessings

93
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,360
I would have felt contented.

94
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,320
Is this marriage

95
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,290
correct, brother Yudhishthir?

96
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,220
Mother's decision

97
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,290
is always correct.

98
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,450
But

99
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,320
the marriage of an ogre
and a human...

100
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,320
Hidimba's love is pure, son.

101
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,420
Using shackles like complexion,
creed and correctness

102
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,230
to enslave love

103
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,260
is not correct.

104
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,190
Mother is correct.

105
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,330
Look at Hidimba's face.

106
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,290
It is glowing with happiness.

107
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
The look of happiness on
brother Bheem's face is no less.

108
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,190
I was just jesting, mother.

109
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,260
Go on.

110
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,160
All hail King Vrikodar!

111
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,290
All hail King Vrikodar!

112
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,130
All hail King Vrikodar!

113
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,930
Bless you.

114
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,990
Bless you.

115
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,770
'Hastinapur.'

116
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,860
'A while later.'

117
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,740
'The priest from
the kingdom of Panchal'

118
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,030
seeks permission
to meet His Highness.

119
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,890
May the Lord

120
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,860
bless His Highness
Dhritarashtra.

121
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,700
The King of Panchal has sent
you a present, Your Highness.

122
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,930
What is it, Duryodhan?

123
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,860
It is an earthen pot, father.

124
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,770
Since when did the King of
Panchal become so impoverished

125
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,900
that instead of a gold pot

126
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,930
he has sent an earthen one?

127
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,770
What is inside it?

128
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,700
Only an earthen pot can
hold fire, Your Highness.

129
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,900
The Prince ought to know this.

130
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,670
There is a letter for you.
- What does it say?

131
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,860
Nothing is written
on it, father.

132
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,700
Duryodhan

133
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,660
hold this letter above
the fire in that pot.

134
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,830
The message will appear.

135
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,730
Then do it yourself, Minister.

136
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,600
Your Highness

137
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,540
a 'swayamvar' for the
Princess of Panchal, Draupadi

138
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,590
is being held
and this is its invite.

139
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,700
What is the meaning of sending
an invite in this manner, Vidur?

140
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,730
Our Princess was born
from the fire, Your Highness.

141
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,670
And this magical pot has
the power to bear fire in it.

142
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,610
If there is such a
Crown Prince in the kingdom

143
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,510
then he is invited to take part
in the competition, My Lord.

144
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,510
Was that an invitation

145
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
or an insult, father?

146
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,610
It is just like fire, beloved.

147
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,500
Just like fire.

148
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,770
If one can control it

149
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,560
it gives life

150
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,510
but if one cannot

151
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,500
it leads to death.

152
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,670
The truth is that this letter

153
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
is an invite

154
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,470
and also an insult.

155
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,540
Is there a Crown Prince
in Hastinapur

156
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,660
who can be sent
to this 'swayamvar?'

157
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,630
Certainly.

158
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,670
I am the heir to this kingdom.

159
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,640
But my beloved

160
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,630
you have not yet been
declared the Crown Prince.

161
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,540
And the invitation is only

162
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,500
for the Crown Prince.

163
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,500
Whether you are
the Crown Prince or not

164
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,460
can be clarified
only by His Highness.

165
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,560
Yes.

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
After hearing this message

167
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,460
I can declare you
the Crown Prince, son.

168
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Then it is time for me

169
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,370
to go and talk to grandsire
himself, father.
