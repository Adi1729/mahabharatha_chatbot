1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,990
Your Highness

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,870
you have lost the independence

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,130
of your younger brothers,
servants Nakul and Sahadev

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,060
in the game.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,000
My darling,
who will you bet now?

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,930
When there is a reduction
in the opponent's property

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,930
playing the game
becomes truly enjoyable.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,000
However, when there is
a reduction in his might

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,060
winning the game
becomes a joyful experience!

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,900
Uncle

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,130
Arjun will be my servant now.

12
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,960
A person who is
at par with Arjun...

13
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,890
Do you even have such a
person with you, Duryodhan?

14
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,930
My friend

15
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
King Karna of Anga!

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,030
The son of a charioteer!

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,960
How is the son of a charioteer
at par with a Prince?

18
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,060
Crown Prince Bheem!

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,920
Yes, I am the son
of a charioteer

20
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,930
but abducting a woman

21
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,890
who is to be married
to someone else

22
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,930
can be done only by ogres!

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,930
Friend Duryodhan,
have you decided to bet me

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,800
against such an amoral person?

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,920
No, friend.

26
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,960
I have decided
to make him your servant.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Friend Karna

28
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,870
will you give me the permission

29
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,760
to bet you in the game?

30
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,960
He shall indeed
give you the permission!

31
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,970
King Karna of Anga

32
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,830
has even sold his soul to you!

33
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,730
On behalf of Emperor Yudhishthir

34
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,870
I bet myself in the game!

35
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,730
Dear, Crown Prince Duryodhan
has bet

36
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,860
your husband in the
game of dice being played.

37
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,730
Until now, he was an accessory
to unrighteousness

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,700
but today

39
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,890
he is just a means.

40
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,640
Today, I am ashamed
to call Karna

41
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,860
as my son.

42
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,790
Human beings are
being treated like property

43
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
and being bet in the
game of dice, father-in-law!

44
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,600
Yes, dear.

45
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,600
I got to know from the
charioteer of the Crown Prince

46
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,670
that Duryodhan will enslave
the five sons of Pandu.

47
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,630
And in the end, by enslaving
the innocent daughter of Drupad

48
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
she will be subjected to insult.

49
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,690
Queen Mother.

50
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,760
Go on, Your Highness.
Just four more points

51
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,630
and you will reach
the castle square.

52
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,740
Uncle, my patience
is giving in now.

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,630
Make haste in making
Arjun my servant.

54
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,730
Your Highness,
I say this with great grief

55
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,730
that another piece of yours
has been captured.

56
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,600
You now have
only one piece with you.

57
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,690
You need to save it.

58
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,630
Only then will
Prince Arjun be safe.

59
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,440
Only twelve more points
to win this.

60
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,430
Go on, my dice.

61
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,600
Prince Arjun has been

62
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,590
lost by the Emperor.

63
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,360
May the Emperor have happiness!

64
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,360
Friend Karna

65
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,370
I give you a servant
as a present.

66
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,390
Arjun.

67
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,370
And Arjun,
where is your bow?

68
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,390
What is it called again?

69
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,390
The Gandiva,
brother Duryodhan.

70
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,560
I have heard that Agni Dev

71
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,490
had preyed upon the illusion
of the Khandavprastha forest

72
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,570
and had used that illusion
to make that bow, brother.

73
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,420
Give it to Karna.

74
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,560
Give your bow
to Karna, Arjun.

75
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,590
The blessing of Agni Dev

76
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,340
in the hands of a servant

77
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,460
does not befit him.

78
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,470
Give Karna your bow, Arjun!
Give it!

79
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920
Do accept it,
King Karna of Anga.

80
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,660
If I have your permission

81
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,830
then I shall imprison each God
residing in the heavens

82
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,700
and have each one of them
make such a bow for you.

83
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,820
I have lost my independence

84
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,800
but not my competence.

85
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,660
Keep it with you, Arjun.

86
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,720
Keep your Gandiva with you.

87
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,760
I do not require
any celestial bow.

88
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,830
My skills as an archer

89
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,890
are celestial by definition.

90
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,630
Servant Arjun

91
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,830
go and kneel down over there.

92
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,790
We need to begin the game.

93
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Your Highness
shall we begin the game?

94
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,570
You may certainly begin,
King of Gandhar!

95
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,660
The Emperor shall bet me
in this round of the game.

96
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,750
Get up, Duryodhan!

97
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,760
You need to bet yourself
against me.

98
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
No, brother Bheem.

99
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,730
I shall bet my beloved
younger brother

100
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,690
Dusshasan against you.

101
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,600
This is the only opportunity
to defeat me, Duryodhan.

102
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,500
You will never be able
to defeat me henceforth.

103
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,670
Your Highness
shall we begin the game?

104
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,620
I pardon you in advance for
losing my independence, brother.

105
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,590
I know that you shall lose me

106
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,660
but my mace shall never be
subservient to another!

107
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,600
Not even for a moment!

108
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,530
May the Emperor have happiness!

109
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,490
If we have your permission
then may we begin the game?

110
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,570
Before losing my independence,
will you answer a question?

111
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,620
After losing
your younger brothers

112
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,400
do you still take pride in your
character and righteousness?

113
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,660
I am ashamed of myself, Bheem.

114
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,500
I have no pride.

115
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,370
Then you cannot bet
yourself in this game.

116
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,620
If you remain independent
then you shall free us soon.

117
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,930
Go on and play,
King of Gandhar.

118
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,930
Go on, my dice.

119
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,060
King of Gandhar

120
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,790
only six more points

121
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,030
and your piece will
capture that of brother.

122
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,860
Go on and play.

123
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,990
Your piece has captured
that of brother.

124
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,030
I think, you will win
this round as well.

125
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,730
He shall indeed win,
brother Bheem

126
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,800
but has he ever wondered

127
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,830
what all he has lost
by winning this round?

128
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,760
No, he has not!

129
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,800
Keep quiet,
servant!

130
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,800
Servants do not have

131
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,990
the permission to interfere!

132
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,700
Then you may
punish us, brother.

133
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Uh!

134
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,900
Master Duryodhan.

135
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,770
You should resume the game now.

136
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,960
Go on, my dice.

137
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,860
There you go,
King of Gandhar.

138
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,790
I have even lost
my younger brother Bheem.

139
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,700
Now, even Bheem is your servant.

140
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,660
Brother Duryodhan

141
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,700
you now have nothing
in your property

142
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,730
which you can bet in the game

143
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,790
and neither do I have
anything with me

144
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,700
in which I take pride.

145
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,660
I have lost all my pride.

146
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,760
So, I quit the game.
