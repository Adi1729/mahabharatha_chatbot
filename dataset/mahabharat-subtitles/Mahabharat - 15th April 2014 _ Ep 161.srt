1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,000
I shall bring all your brothers
back to life.

2
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,000
I shall be eternally grateful
to you, Dharma Raj.

3
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,260
I am very pleased

4
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,060
and also quite eager
to bless you

5
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,000
with any boon you ask for.

6
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,000
Go ahead and ask for
power, competence

7
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,160
weapons, wealth, army

8
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,990
or any other thing you like.

9
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,170
By bringing the four brothers
of mine back to life

10
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,030
you have given me
power, competence

11
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,150
and wealth,
Dharma Raj.

12
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,970
The only blessing we wish
to seek, Dharma Raj

13
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,150
is that may we five brothers,
along with our wife

14
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,950
be able to complete our final
year of exile in anonymity.

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,190
I shall bless all of you with
the art of disguising yourselves

16
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,060
dear Yudhishthir.

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,160
During your final year
of exile in anonymity

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,130
the art of disguising yourselves
will aid you in staying hidden.

19
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,090
It is time now,
dear Yudhishthir

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,030
for all four of your brothers
to leave to complete

21
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,120
their meditation.

22
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,190
Even the Gods are quite eager
to see righteousness

23
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,000
prevail once again on the earth.

24
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,930
Bless you,
dear.

25
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,170
What danger had befallen
all of you, My Lords?

26
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,170
There was no danger,
Panchali.

27
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,000
It was only a test.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,070
Call it the first test,
Sahadev.

29
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,000
We have to give many more tests
in the next 12 years.

30
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,960
One's meditation is incomplete
without tests.

31
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,860
That is why,
the time has come

32
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,020
for Bheem, Arjun,
Nakul and Sahadev

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,870
to leave in order to complete
their respective meditation.

34
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,090
Will everyone

35
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,090
go in different directions
from this place, My Lord?

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,960
Yes, Panchali.

37
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,130
One has to revere
the Gods for ages.

38
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,970
Only then do they get pleased.

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,830
We have only 12 years
to please them.

40
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,830
You are correct,
My Lord.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,900
The people who know their limits

42
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,930
become truly powerful.

43
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,990
If one remembers this key point

44
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,930
then I am certain

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,890
that all of you will
indeed be successful.

46
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,090
My Lord Arjun

47
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,020
I fear that

48
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,020
your meditation will be
the most arduous one

49
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,860
because when
Mahadev tests someone

50
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,030
He shakes up the belief
of that person completely.

51
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,870
However, the faith
of the five of us

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,960
will become your might.

53
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
You need not be scared.

54
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,860
And neither do you need
to hide from us so, spies.

55
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,890
In order to keep an eye on us,
you have been

56
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,730
travelling with us
all this while.

57
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,720
That is why, you are
like family to us now.

58
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,890
Henceforth,
all your meals

59
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,860
shall be brought by me.
- No, Your Highness.

60
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,770
We cannot have a meal with you.

61
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,850
You most certainly can.

62
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,700
And you need not tell Duryodhan
anything regarding this.

63
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,790
However

64
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,700
you must tell him

65
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,600
that we will not hide
for the next 12 years.

66
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,790
That is why,
sending spies after us

67
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,690
is of no use.

68
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,670
However,
in the thirteenth year

69
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,730
when we shall live
a life of anonymity

70
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,830
all the treachery
of the King of Gandhar

71
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,660
all the competence
of the King of Anga

72
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,770
and even the entire
property of Duryodhan

73
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,620
will not be able to find us.

74
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,700
We shall appear

75
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,600
only when we decide to.

76
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,830
Tell the 100 sons
of King Dhritarashtra

77
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,830
that the son of Pandu,
Vrikodar Bheem, shall arrive

78
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,700
as their death

79
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,730
and one can only await it.

80
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,670
It cannot be stopped.

81
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,690
These many 'laddoos' are
sufficient for Lord Hanuman.

82
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,520
A sacrament is merely
meant to be tasted.

83
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,730
The Almighty feels satiated with
the devotion of the devotee!

84
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,460
I should keep two more
'laddoos' aside for myself.

85
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,430
'Om Anjani Sut Pavan Putra
Tubhyam Namah!'

86
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,620
'Aavaha...'

87
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,500
'Om Anjani Sut Pavan Putra
Tubhyam Namah!'

88
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,430
'Aavaha...'

89
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,630
'Om Hanumate Marute
Tubhyam Namah!'

90
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,460
'Aavaha...'

91
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,560
Go!
Go away!

92
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,470
This sacrament is for Lord Hanuman, son of Pavan Dev.*
*Pavan Dev: a name of Vayu, the god of wind.

93
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,520
You ate the 'laddoo'
meant for the Lord!

94
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,570
I shall be held accountable
for this along with you.

95
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Go away.

96
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,630
Go away from here!

97
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,470
What would the Almighty do
with two 'laddoos?'

98
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,470
One is more than
sufficient for Him.

99
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,370
'Om Hanumate Marute
Tubhyam Namah!'

100
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,360
'Aavaha...'

101
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,400
Get away!

102
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,490
Who are you?!

103
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,400
You seem to be
an illusory being!

104
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,450
I think you have been sent here
to interrupt my meditation

105
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,260
by that wicked Duryodhan!

106
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,490
You seem to be
an adept illusory being

107
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,280
but do not forget

108
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,330
that I have married an ogre!

109
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,330
My son is
an illusory being as well!

110
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,420
Your illusion will not
work before me.

111
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,350
I will kill you.

112
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,290
Markatasur,* just wait a moment!
*Monkey demon.

113
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,160
You are a strange human being.

114
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,190
First, you invoke me
and call me for a meal

115
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,360
and then fight with me
for no apparent reason.

116
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,160
Pardon me, My Lord!
Pardon me!

117
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,300
I had only imagined you
in your titan avatar.

118
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,150
I could not recognize you

119
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,320
in this tiny form of yours.

120
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,190
Upon seeing a tiny being

121
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,330
did you also underestimate
his might, Bheem?

122
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,220
In other words

123
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,150
you do not know
the true form of might.

124
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,230
I seek your refuge to know
precisely that, My Lord.

125
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,160
You are my younger
brother, Bheem.

126
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,260
By praying to my father,
Pavan Dev

127
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,090
your parents had been
blessed with you.

128
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,160
That is why, I shall indeed tell
you about the mystery of might.

129
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,060
First,
you must...

130
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,190
That sacrament

131
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,190
is meant for me,
is it not?

132
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,030
So, go bring it.

133
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,190
You ate all my 'laddoos,'
brother Hanuman.

134
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
At least leave that one for me.

135
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,220
So, take it.

136
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,160
Speed should be
in the nature of might.

137
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,090
The might that becomes inactive

138
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,190
gets disintegrated.

139
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,250
That is why, in order
to serve Lord Ram

140
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,220
when Pavan Dev created me

141
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,030
He gave me the form of a monkey.

142
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,030
I shall always remember this.

143
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,020
Please give that to me now,
brother Hanuman!

144
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,980
Then get up.

145
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,880
When did I stop you?

146
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,940
Splendid.

147
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,010
Marvellous.

148
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,910
Composure should be
in the nature of might.

149
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,850
When one has a lively exterior

150
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,890
it is essential
to have a calm mind

151
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,080
otherwise the whole
of might falls apart.

152
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,080
No matter what task is at hand

153
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,980
it can only be successful

154
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
when the person executing it
has a lively exterior

155
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,850
and a calm mind.

156
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,040
That is why
in a battlefield

157
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,950
I focus my thoughts

158
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,080
on Lord Ram

159
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,940
in order to stay calm.

160
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,980
Indeed. I shall
always remember this.

161
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,050
But at least give me
that 'laddoo,' brother.

162
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,780
Take it.

163
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,910
You are indeed my
younger brother, Bheem.

164
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,940
No one can learn
the mystery of might

165
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,780
this quickly.

166
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,750
The basis of might is

167
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,010
to assimilate everything.

168
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,840
In other words, to know all
that is happening around

169
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,890
and the capability of
receiving all the information.

170
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,790
What man fails to see or hear

171
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,820
becomes his weakness.

172
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,950
The aim of might is focus.

173
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,780
The Almighty gave man might
only to teach him how to focus.

174
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,780
If one cannot focus one's might

175
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,820
it is of no use.

176
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,980
In other words,
speed

177
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,910
composure

178
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,810
assimilation

179
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,680
focus.

180
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,690
I am exceedingly pleased
with you, brother Bheem.

181
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,910
Whenever you are
in a battle or struggle

182
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,750
I shall be your might.

183
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,950
I shall always remain
around you inconspicuously.

184
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,840
Your mere bellow had killed
numerous ogres of Lanka.

185
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,880
With your blessing

186
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,720
in the great war,
my bellow

187
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,840
will crush the courage
of the sons of Dhritarashtra!

188
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,750
Indeed, Bheem.

189
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,720
When the Almighty himself
is the charioteer

190
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,880
and justice and righteousness

191
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,780
are the wheels of that chariot

192
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,650
the flag atop it

193
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,910
shall always be blessed by me.

194
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,750
May you be victorious.
