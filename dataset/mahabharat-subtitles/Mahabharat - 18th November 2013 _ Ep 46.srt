1
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Greetings.

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,430
May you live long.

3
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,330
Wonderful!

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,600
You are way more skilled
in archery than me.

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,500
My knowledge of the art can
only improve the hunting skills

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,370
of my disciples.

7
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,290
Hunting?

8
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,540
That is not a form of art,
teacher.

9
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,530
I am wandering
around to learn.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,530
I have gone
to numerous hermitages

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,360
and tried to become a disciple.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,300
I have scaled the regions
of Kuru and Panchal for it.

13
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,300
I did not do so only
to learn the art of hunting.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,290
But who will teach you
the skills that you seek?

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,360
You are well aware
that our community

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,270
does not have the right to
learn such higher skills.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,440
Knowledge is made by God
as is water and air.

18
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,300
How can someone
have the right to it?

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,500
I do not wish to argue
with you, Karna.

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,460
You will gain nothing
from my hermitage.

21
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,460
Near the banks of river Drishadvati*
*"She with many stones", seasonal river estimated at southern boundaries of Kuru.

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,500
lies the hermitage
of the revered Drona.

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,430
Request him

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,460
if he's willing to accept you
as his disciple.

25
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,300
But know this.

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,360
To make an enemy of the entire
society only for your sake

27
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,460
is not something people
would either like

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,460
or have the capability
of doing so.

29
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,440
That is why accept the clan
you were born into

30
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,320
as your fate

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
and try to lead a happy life.

32
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,370
'I do not believe in this
discrimination of caste.'

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,170
'I shall certainly go to
the revered Dronacharya'

34
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,390
'and learn from him.'

35
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,370
Arjun.

36
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,230
Greetings, Sire.

37
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,330
Who are you?
- I am Karna.

38
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,260
I have come to you for I
have heard of your fame, Sire.

39
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,100
I hope to learn the art
of archery from you.

40
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,260
My father is the charioteer
of the great Bheeshma.

41
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,290
Son of a charioteer?

42
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,300
Then how could you even dream
of learning the art of archery?

43
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,220
Don't you know

44
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,070
that only Kshatriyas have
the right to higher knowledge?

45
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,120
Son of a charioteer...

46
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,170
Indeed!
I am the son of a charioteer!

47
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,070
And Sire, I am not asking for
a kingdom like the Kshatriyas.

48
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,200
I merely wish
to fortify my capabilities.

49
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,060
Then why can I not learn
the art of archery?

50
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,260
To a deserving person,
his capability is his blessing.

51
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,030
In that case, why did
you learn the art of battle?

52
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,260
Why are you teaching
military arts to your son

53
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,060
revered Drona?

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,060
Do not argue.

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,160
I am unique.

56
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,100
I was not born from
the womb of a woman.

57
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,070
I was born in the drona* vessel of sage Bharadwaj.
*Pitcher, leavepot.

58
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,070
If you also had a divine birth
then prove it.

59
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,130
Otherwise go away.
- Divine?

60
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,130
What do you mean by that, Sire?

61
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,270
The birth of every child
is divine for his parents.

62
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,060
No one has the right
to weigh the love of a mother

63
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,000
and the dreams of a father

64
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,000
in the scales of caste
and creed.

65
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,140
My father's heart
bleeds each time

66
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,100
he tells me to stay away
from archery.

67
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,000
Why does the society
frighten him so?

68
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,100
Why can I not be the reason
of pride and honour for him?

69
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,200
Why must I live
by curbing my capabilities?

70
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Who has made these rules, Sire?

71
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,070
Did my father choose the caste
he would be born into?

72
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,170
Did his ancestors
make this choice?

73
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,930
Then why do such rules exist

74
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,940
that weigh human beings
on the scales of discrimination?

75
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,170
Why?

76
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
No.

77
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,130
I do not believe
in such rules, Sire.

78
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,060
I would be honoured to break
such traditions.

79
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,130
A bow belongs to a person
who can tie its string.

80
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,940
And that is acquired by deeds,
not by birth.

81
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,930
Your arrogance is soaring high

82
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,930
but it is worthless.

83
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,160
Higher knowledge belongs only
to Kshatriyas and Brahmins.

84
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,930
Not to people of a lower class.

85
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,900
Ghee* is used to light the
holy fire in a Yagna.
*A class of clarified butter.

86
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,000
But a clay oven is fuelled
with crude oil.

87
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,900
But Lord Parashuram

88
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,030
had used Ghee
to light a clay oven.

89
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,970
Go away.

90
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Go away!

91
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,130
I do not even
wish to see your face.

92
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,890
I am leaving.

93
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,870
I shall go and gain knowledge
from the one

94
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,940
who imparted knowledge to you.

95
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,020
I shall return.

96
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,130
But let me assure you

97
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,030
that I shall return as the most
skilled archer of this nation.

98
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,000
And I shall be better
than all your disciples.

99
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,010
What does superiority mean?

100
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,230
Superiority means, having
more knowledge than others.

101
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,970
In other words, it is immaterial

102
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,100
how much
knowledge you have obtained.

103
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,160
The thing that matters is how
much more knowledge you have

104
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,040
obtained than others.

105
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,110
In other words,
the desire to be superior

106
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,070
makes even obtaining knowledge
a competition.

107
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,170
And when does victory become
decisive in a competition?

108
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,070
It is possible to be superior
for a limited period of time

109
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,200
but no one can be superior forever.

110
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,240
That is when discontent,
agony

111
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,940
and struggle are born.

112
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,200
But, instead
of becoming superior

113
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,160
if one tries to excel

114
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,030
then what would it be like?

115
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,070
To excel means to obtain
all that is worth obtaining.

116
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,940
It is not out of the desire
to gain more than others

117
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,130
but merely for
the contentment of the soul.

118
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,970
On the path of excellence

119
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,990
one does not
compete with others.

120
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,030
It is a competition
with oneself.

121
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,070
In other words, one trying
to excel will sooner or later

122
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,130
gain all the knowledge.

123
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,170
Even without trying,
he becomes superior.

124
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,940
But the one
who tries to be superior

125
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,970
may or may not succeed

126
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,970
but he can never excel.

127
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,900
Do think about it.

128
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,900
With my hair

129
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,100
I renounce the rules
of the society.

130
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,960
The society that has insulted me

131
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,930
shall be the recipient
of my blow.

132
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
With my old apparels

133
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,870
I renounce all traditions.

134
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,870
My new form will usher the
beginning of a new tradition.

135
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,960
By smearing the ashes of caste
and creed on my forehead

136
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,100
I pledge that henceforth

137
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,930
my capability is my identity

138
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,800
and my knowledge is my religion.

139
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,130
Greetings.

140
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you a Brahmin?

141
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,030
I too, like you

142
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
am opposed to the Kshatriyas,
my Lord.

143
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,000
I am not opposed to Kshatriyas

144
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,000
but to the tyranny
of the Kshatriyas.

145
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,060
And even more than that

146
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,100
I am opposed to feeble Brahmins

147
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,030
feeble human beings

148
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,160
and the feeble society.

149
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,030
I have come to you

150
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,100
with the hope
of becoming strong.

151
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,900
I have given up teaching.

152
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,930
And I have donated
all my weapons.

153
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,960
But I

154
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,900
upon seeing
the aura of your face

155
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,860
am filled with the desire
of imparting knowledge to you.

156
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,940
If you are a Brahmin, son

157
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,000
then I shall indeed
impart knowledge to you.

158
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,040
'People of our caste
can become only charioteers'

159
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,930
'and not warriors.'

160
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,830
'A charioteer carrying
weapons

161
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,900
'has no place
in the kingdom of Kuru.'

162
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,090
'Are you the son
of a charioteer?'

163
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,990
'Then how could you even dream
of learning the art of archery?'

164
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,890
'Higher knowledge belongs only
to Kshatriyas and Brahmins.'

165
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,060
'Not to people
of a lower class.'

166
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,060
I am

167
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,060
a Brahmin, my Lord.

168
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,940
Karna, from today, your
training in military arts

169
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,960
shall begin.

170
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,770
You created the sun,
Lord Parashuram?

171
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,830
My dear boy, similarly

172
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,790
the day you are
able to do this

173
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
your desire to learn
the art of archery

174
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,960
shall indeed be fulfilled.

175
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,740
'12 Years Later.'
