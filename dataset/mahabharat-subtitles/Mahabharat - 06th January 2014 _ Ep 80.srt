1
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,090
Eldest brother!

2
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,920
The guards will spot us
if we go that way.

3
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,950
We must take a different path.

4
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,990
This way!

5
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,940
Brother!

6
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,980
There is no other way, Arjun!

7
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,080
Those cowards have
set it ablaze on all sides.

8
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,980
Arjun! You must use
the 'Varunastra'!

9
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,980
The 'Varunastra'...
No!

10
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,020
If the fire is doused, everyone
will know that we are alive.

11
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,890
The walls are starting to melt,
eldest brother!

12
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,750
'They say that Goddess Saraswati
could not flow on this earth'

13
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,760
'holding a divine fire
in her hands.'

14
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,820
'Therefore, she started
flowing under the ground.'

15
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,020
'If you bathe,
recounting this tale'

16
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,850
'you will be blessed, Arjun!'

17
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,920
Eldest brother!

18
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,820
Lord Krishna had narrated to me,
the tale of Goddess Saraswati.

19
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,850
When it became impossible
for the river

20
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,760
to flow over the ground, she
began flowing under the ground.

21
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,910
It was surely an advice
meant for this day.

22
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,850
Even we must find a way
through the ground.

23
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Excellent suggestion!

24
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,790
This way!

25
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,920
Make haste!

26
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,750
Mother!
- Mother!

27
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,620
Bheem!

28
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Brother Bheem!

29
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,690
Brother Bheem!

30
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Mother!

31
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,620
Arjun!

32
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,590
Eldest brother! Take mother
away to a safe place.

33
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,720
No, Yudhisthir! I...
I won't leave without Arjun.

34
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,490
We will wait for you, Arjun!

35
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,680
We cannot go without you!

36
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,590
Mother's safety is more crucial,
brother Bheem!

37
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,490
Arjun!

38
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,490
Take mother away from here!

39
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,680
Make haste, brother Bheem!

40
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,710
Make haste,
the flames are rising!

41
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,690
No, Arjun!

42
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,650
Eldest brother!
Leave this place!

43
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,420
Take mother to a safe place.
Go!

44
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,390
Go!

45
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,390
Go!

46
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,270
Bheem! Mother!

47
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,400
Mother, have patience!

48
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,360
Arjun must be on his way.

49
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,230
Yudhisthir, Arjun...

50
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Nakul.

51
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,010
Yudhisthir... Take all your
brothers out here and I...

52
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,040
I shall wait for Arjun.
- No!

53
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,170
Brother, we won't leave
without mother.

54
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,210
Sahadev!
- We will all wait, mother!

55
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,260
We lived together.

56
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,100
And we will be together
in death too.

57
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,670
Before any flame
even touches mother

58
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,770
it will have to scorch us first.

59
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,680
Arjun!

60
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,540
Arjun!

61
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,570
My dear Arjun!
