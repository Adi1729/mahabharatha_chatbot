1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
They...

2
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,960
They were talking about

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,970
the Pandava's mother?

4
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,090
Duryodhan must surely
be conspiring to have

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,890
the Pandav brothers and their
mother killed at Varnavat.

6
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,960
I must speak to
Grandsire Bheeshma about this.

7
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,920
Why did you have to
wake me up, brother?

8
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,760
You will be eating alone.

9
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,970
Nakul, I'll share
the food with you.

10
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,790
But first, help me
locate the kitchen!

11
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,770
Years ago, an attendant
had told us the way.

12
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,900
Use your sense of smell.

13
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,770
My senses had failed me and
that's why I woke you up.

14
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,990
There's no aroma of food
emanating from anywhere

15
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,920
in the entire palace.

16
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,830
Come.
Let's find the kitchen.

17
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,700
Guard!

18
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,730
Nakul, don't raise your voice!
Everybody will wake up!

19
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,790
The guard is supposed
to stay awake.

20
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,660
Greetings, Prince!

21
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,860
Guard, show my brother
the way to the kitchen.

22
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Prince, the kitchen is
located outside the palace.

23
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,800
You mean, this huge palace

24
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,690
doesn't have a kitchen?

25
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,890
Forgive me, Prince Bheem!

26
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,700
I wasn't aware that you have
your dinner, late in the night.

27
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,800
From tomorrow,
this maid will stand outside

28
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,700
your chamber, holding a
plate full of delicacies.

29
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,890
Please step forward!

30
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,600
But why did you not construct a
kitchen in such a huge palace?

31
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,820
The maids preparing the food
should remain outside the palace

32
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,600
so that you and the queen
are not inconvenienced

33
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,590
that's why, Prince.

34
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,600
But it's very inconvenient
for me.

35
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,830
Get a kitchen made in
the palace.

36
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,690
But, Prince Bheem...
- Why do you stutter?

37
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,820
Will the palace go up in
flames if food is prepared here?

38
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,790
What are you afraid of?

39
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,730
No, Prince Bheem.
Why would I be afraid?

40
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,530
And why would the
palace go up in flames?

41
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,630
Follow my dictum!

42
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,820
As you wish, Prince!

43
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,530
'This is rather astonishing!'

44
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,730
'Such a huge palace
has no dining room!'

45
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,730
'If you pronounce Yudhistir as
the crown prince in court

46
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,560
'tomorrow, I will not care
about the reputation'

47
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,530
'and dignity of Hastinapur.'

48
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
'Very soon'

49
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,560
'you will be rid of
your worries, Bheem!'

50
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,520
Leave us alone!

51
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,560
You called for me, father?

52
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,490
Why is Purochan at Varnavat?

53
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,590
Have you made Purochan
construct a new palace?

54
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Indeed!

55
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,530
My dear brothers will
be staying at Varnavat.

56
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,400
Therefore, I had to get a
palace constructed.

57
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,470
This means you are responsible

58
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,620
for their journey to Varnavat.

59
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,530
Tell me the truth!

60
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,620
Why do you seem
so stressed, father?

61
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,450
Why am I stressed?

62
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,570
I am worried because I am afraid
that you must have planned

63
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,630
something at Varnavat which
would be totally unscrupulous!

64
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,530
Unscrupulous!

65
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,630
Father, there's no morality
in anything immoral.

66
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,530
If a drop of poison is
put in milk

67
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,500
the milk becomes
contaminated, father.

68
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,460
When I had poisoned Bheem

69
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,460
you knew then that it's immoral.

70
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,400
But it didn't trouble you
all that much, father.

71
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,490
Yes, I wasn't troubled
back then.

72
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,590
A powerful man wishes
for more power!

73
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,560
Someone with moderate
income wishes for wealth.

74
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,360
But in old age.

75
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,930
In his old age when he knows
that he will die soon

76
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,830
then a desire for fame,
glory and honour

77
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,060
are what he yearns for.

78
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,830
The body doesn't last
but one can at least

79
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,990
hope that their name lasts
until the end of time.

80
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
My son.

81
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,060
Please don't engage in
activities which might malign

82
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,890
My image posthumously!

83
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,930
I know that you are the
epitome of righteousness.

84
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,930
Whenever a choice has to
be made between my happiness

85
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,900
and your righteousness

86
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,970
I am the one
who suffers injustice!

87
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,890
That's the reason

88
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,830
behind me not disclosing

89
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,960
My Plan to you!

90
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Son!

91
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,930
Please listen to me.

92
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,990
During acquisition of kingdoms
warriors do die but...

93
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Murdering a woman
is disgraceful, son.

94
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,990
If anything happens to Kunti,
what do I answer Pandu

95
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,000
in the netherworld
past my death, son?

96
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,960
What do I answer him?

97
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,760
Father.

98
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,960
When a flame burns, it's
not just the fuel that burns

99
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,730
but the wick too.

100
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,900
One who bothers about the wick,
cannot obtain light.

101
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,730
But you have never lit a lamp

102
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,990
in your entire life.

103
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,930
Perhaps that is why
you are unaware of this fact.

104
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,840
In Varnavrat, even the memories

105
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,790
of uncle's family shall burn.

106
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,860
This is my decision.

107
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,660
Go inform His Highness

108
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,890
that the prime minister needs to
discuss an important matter.

109
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,690
Pardon me, Sire.

110
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,660
His Highness Bheeshma
is in the playground.

111
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,890
He is examining the new
recruits in the army.

112
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,800
Soldiers, if the enemy surrounds
you from three directions

113
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,590
and leaves you
no way to escape

114
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,700
then retreat backwards,
feigning defeat.

115
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,660
This makes the enemy carefree
and he lets his guard down.

116
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,820
Then, seize your
opportunity and...

117
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,590
Attack!

118
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,530
In battle, it isn't strength
that is important

119
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,820
it's the timing.

120
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
What is the reason
for your smile, Vidur?

121
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,630
It's surprise, Grandsire!

122
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,530
Greetings!
- Bless you!

123
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,660
They say that a 'Gandharv'* may sing all his life
*A community associated with singing and dancing to entertain the gods.

124
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,720
yet he never sings
the same tune twice.

125
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,720
He brings forth something new
every moment.

126
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,620
Even you teach me something new
every day, Grandsire.

127
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,660
I had taught you this strategy
in your childhood, Vidur.

128
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
Yes you had, Grandsire.

129
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,720
But then, I hadn't been able
to understand the fact

130
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,730
that in battle, timing is more
important than strength.

131
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,720
Waiting for the right moment
isn't defeat

132
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,500
but it's strategic instead.

133
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,590
I shall take leave,
Grandsire.

134
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,550
Bless you!

135
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,650
Vidur!

136
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,460
Were you here for a purpose?
- Yes.

137
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,460
And that purpose
has been served, Grandsire.

138
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,660
When one learns what he
wants to, he is happy.

139
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,620
And when one learns what is
worth learning

140
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,660
then he attains bliss,
Grandsire.

141
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,620
Greetings, Grandsire!

142
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,620
Greetings, Sire.

143
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,500
Have this sack of grains sent
to Varnavrat immediately.

144
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,530
Any message along with that,
minister?

145
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,520
Yes.

146
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,590
Just tell them

147
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,620
that when a single grain
is sowed into the soil

148
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,500
it yields many more.

149
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,260
Nakul.

150
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,130
Which damsel awaits you
at Varnavrat

151
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,370
that you are grooming
yourself so much?

152
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,370
I have heard that just the royal
maids are present in forests.

153
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,200
Not the princesses.

154
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,070
In fact, I suggest that you look
into the mirror too, brother.

155
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,070
Have you ever thought
what would happen

156
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
if an ogress falls in love
with you?

157
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,300
Nakul.
- Bheem!

158
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,230
Mother is waiting.
We should get going.

159
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,230
Mother!
It's time for the veneration!

160
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,060
But Arjun isn't here yet.

161
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,990
Let us wait a while for him.
