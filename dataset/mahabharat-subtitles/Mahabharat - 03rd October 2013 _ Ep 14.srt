1
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:17,200
Who dare interrupts my speech!

2
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,178
M-My lord..

3
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:28,110
Son Dhritarashtra.

4
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:34,183
Mother?

5
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:43,125
Are you ready, son?

6
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,255
I have been ready for years,
mother.

7
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,098
Greetings.

8
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:50,261
May you live long.

9
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:54,140
Today, your wait will end, son.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,367
Today, you will become
the Emperor of Hastinapur.

11
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:03,239
For the first time in my life

12
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:05,351
I too am experiencing
such great happiness.

13
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:09,280
Come, my son.

14
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:12,155
By the time Vidur and Pandu
are sworn into their ranks

15
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:14,090
we must reach the court.

16
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:17,095
Come, Gandhari.

17
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:25,169
Tell her, mother,
not to accompany me.

18
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:38,080
While moving towards the throne,
if someone hampers my speed

19
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:42,177
I will not
be able to bear it.

20
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,326
Let's go, sister.

21
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,070
Whether or not you can
match up to his speed

22
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:00,333
the Kuru Prince
cannot sit on the throne

23
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,233
without you.

24
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,292
Greetings, grandfather.

25
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,193
Greetings, grandfather.

26
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,166
May you live long.

27
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:07,136
Greetings, Queen Mother.

28
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:08,333
Greetings, Queen Mother.

29
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:11,242
May you prosper.

30
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,224
With this 'tilak,'

31
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,095
I inculcate
justice in my intellect.

32
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:39,296
With this 'tilak'

33
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:43,173
I inculcate dedication
in my intellect.

34
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:49,240
With this water,
I acquire the truth

35
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:53,277
and swear to abide by it.

36
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:57,345
With this water,
l acquire patience.

37
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:18,176
With this white apparel

38
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:22,172
I acquire righteousness
in my life.

39
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,240
l acquire valour.

40
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:55,305
By acquiring this golden scepter

41
00:04:56,282 --> 00:05:01,151
I accept the throne of
Hastinapur as my lord and master

42
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:08,091
Henceforth, all my relationships
and affection

43
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,095
shall be secondary to me.

44
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:13,365
This Royal Scepter
shall inspire me to be fearless

45
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,299
and steadfast.

46
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,301
Like this armour

47
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:21,102
I shall protect the subjects
of our kingdom.

48
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,108
Like this sword

49
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:26,244
I shall always lead in war.

50
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:31,242
The flag of this dynasty
and kingdom

51
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:33,115
shall always be held high by me.

52
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:36,121
For the happiness and glory
of the subjects of Hastinapur

53
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:39,249
I swear to a life
of undying struggle.

54
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:43,318
For the reputation and
independence of the Kuru empire

55
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:47,157
I swear to a life
of undying struggle.

56
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:52,236
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!

57
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:57,174
Long live General Pandu!

58
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,268
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!

59
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:02,109
Long live General Pandu!

60
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:06,277
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!
Long live General Pandu!

61
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,277
Long live Chief Minister Vidur!

62
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:13,224
Long live General Pandu!

63
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:44,290
Greetings, grandfather.

64
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,295
My teacher, greetings.

65
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,169
Greetings, Queen Mother.

66
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,107
May you prosper, my son.

67
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:08,110
After 25 years,
the throne of Hastinapur

68
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:11,147
shall get its lord today.

69
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:18,323
This is one amongst the happiest
moments of my life.

70
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:23,192
Today, you will take over the
duties of your father's kingdom.

71
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:29,232
For all these years,
Bheeshma and I

72
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:33,105
have safeguarded this throne.

73
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,333
Now, the time has come,
Dhritarashtra

74
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:41,313
to coronate you as the king
of the Hastinapur.

75
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:43,342
Stop, brother Dhritarashtra.

76
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,226
Chief Minister Vidur

77
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,361
what is the reason behind
stopping the ceremony?

78
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,327
The reason is, Queen Mother

79
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:12,229
that I have just taken an oath..

80
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:15,272
As the Chief Minister
of Hastinapur

81
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:19,243
I, Vidur, shall uphold
the truth, righteousness

82
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:22,171
the interest of
the throne of Hastinapur

83
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:24,115
and the happiness
of the subjects.

84
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,276
I will never forgo
any of these duties.

85
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:35,225
My relationships and affection
shall be secondary to me.

86
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,226
That is why, Queen Mother

87
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,265
it is my duty to stop this
unrighteousness.

88
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:43,259
What unrighteousness,
Chief Minister?

89
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:46,099
The coronation ceremony,
Queen Mother.

90
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,175
This coronation ceremony
is unrighteous.

91
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,075
A person who is
blind since birth

92
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:58,309
is unworthy
of becoming the king.

93
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,215
A person who is
blind since birth

94
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,491
is unworthy
of becoming the king.

95
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,650
What are you attempting to do,
Chief Minister Vidur?

96
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:33,720
Is this some sort of a facade?

97
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:37,596
Neither is this an attempt
nor a facade, Queen Mother.

98
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,664
This is written
in our scriptures.

99
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:41,864
A person who is
blind since birth

100
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,739
is unworthy
of becoming the king.

101
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,772
Sometimes, righteousness
can be cruel, Queen Mother.

102
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:54,841
In the best interest
of the subjects

103
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:57,776
righteousness demands
personal sacrifice.

104
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,584
How can you say so now,
Chief Minister Vidur?

105
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:04,793
You knew in advance about
the coronation ceremony.

106
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,796
Did righteousness
not strike you then?

107
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:11,732
Righteousness changes according
to situations, Queen Mother.

108
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,598
Righteousness changes?

109
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,731
I have heard such a thing
for the first time.

110
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,768
Although, I have heard
that motives change

111
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,738
but righteousness?

112
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:30,685
Hastinapur is a big kingdom.

113
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,722
It may have
different set of rules.

114
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,653
Prince Shakuni!

115
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,718
You do not have the right

116
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,786
to interfere
in our family matters!

117
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:45,732
Pardon me, great Bheeshma.

118
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:46,858
Pardon me.

119
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:51,830
A brother has the right to speak
in the favour of his sister.

120
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:54,867
This is an accepted norm

121
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:57,679
in the entire region of Arya.

122
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:02,648
Is it still the norm
in Hastinapur or not

123
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:05,753
can be answered only

124
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:10,749
by the righteous
and knowledgeable Vidur.

125
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,885
I can answer
your question as well.

126
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:17,664
To see absolutely no flaw
in one's elder brother

127
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,734
is the duty
of a younger brother.

128
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:24,730
But when the merits and demerits
of a king are being discussed

129
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:27,733
to look beyond the relationship
of an elder brother

130
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:30,669
is the duty of a Chief Minister.

131
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:35,879
But only the eldest son
of the family

132
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,712
has the right to become king,
Chief Minister Vidur.

133
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,812
When all the sons
are equally worthy

134
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:43,816
only then does the eldest son
have this right, Queen Mother.

135
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,596
The season of summer
precedes that of the monsoon

136
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,692
but the monsoon
are way more important

137
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:56,728
because it rains the most
during this season.

138
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,768
When deciding between
age and virtues

139
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:04,611
it is wise to choose virtues,
Queen Mother.

140
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,774
It is written in the scriptures

141
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,619
that the milk of a lioness

142
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,654
can be contained
only in a gold bowl

143
00:13:13,822 --> 00:13:15,687
and not in one
made out of copper.

144
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,651
Similarly, the ability
to rule a kingdom

145
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:21,821
can be carried out
only be a complete person

146
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,823
and not an incomplete one.
- Incomplete!

147
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,732
You call me incomplete!

148
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,791
Pardon me,
brother Dhritarashtra.

149
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,589
Quiet!

150
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:56,660
Quiet.

151
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:02,727
I have been insulted enough,
Vidur.

152
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:09,869
When you're done preaching about
your so called righteousness

153
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,747
to this court

154
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:15,713
then have me informed.

155
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,780
Brother Dhritarashtra!
Stop.

156
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:01,619
Take me to my Lord, Sukta.

157
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:02,853
Alright, Princess.

158
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:08,670
Just because he has no vision

159
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,698
Dhritarashtra cannot
become an able king?

160
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:16,606
I do not agree to this,
Chief Minister Vidur.

161
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,873
Vision is the first weapon
of a king, Queen Mother.

162
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:24,676
If a king cannot

163
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:27,587
read his ministers
by their facial expressions

164
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,593
he will not be able to identify
the enemies of the kingdom.

165
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:35,823
When a king goes hunting

166
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:39,658
he sees the state
of his subjects.

167
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:43,628
He sees their joy and sorrow.

168
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,666
When one comes crying
to the king for justice

169
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,674
apart from hearing
the sounds of his cries

170
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:53,679
it is also essential to look
at his pain, Queen Mother.

171
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,685
How will a blind person
be able to do all this?

172
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:03,621
For these tasks

173
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,784
the Chief Minister, General
and the council of ministers

174
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:08,629
are present,
Chief Minister Vidur.

175
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,629
Pardon me, Queen Mother.

176
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,725
The Chief Minister,
council of ministers

177
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:16,861
and the General
are aides of the King.

178
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,633
It is their duty
to follow the king.

179
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,838
When the king
of a state is weak

180
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:29,740
the council of ministers
and the subjects

181
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,650
of the state become impudent.

182
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,698
Brother Dhritarashtra..

183
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,701
Brother, listen to me.
- Go away!

184
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,606
What is left to hear, Pandu?

185
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,768
I am incomplete?
Me?

186
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,868
The one who struggled with
his deficiency all his life

187
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:59,612
the one who gave it his best
to become normal

188
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:00,707
and now he's called abnormal.

189
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,613
He became the best.

190
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,675
I am incomplete?
I cannot become the king?

191
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,587
That is Vidur's opinion,
brother.

192
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:10,692
As the Chief Minister,
perhaps it's his duty.

193
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,694
But we can also put forth
our point. - Put forth my point!

194
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:16,655
Do I beg them?

195
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,824
Despite being the eldest child
in the dynasty

196
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:21,794
and the most capable one

197
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,771
should I plead for my rights?

198
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:28,674
Those courtiers, the council of
ministers and judiciary

199
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:31,607
who will be paid by me

200
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:32,873
and will be my servants..

201
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,678
Should I plead to them?

202
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:40,719
Please calm down, brother.
- I am calm, Pandu!

203
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:43,749
Had I not been calm

204
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:47,623
I would have killed you
for this betrayal!

205
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,724
Betrayal!

206
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:54,861
Brother, never have I..

207
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:56,763
I understand everything.

208
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,637
You and that
conniving son of a maid

209
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:01,802
have together conspired
against me!

210
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,807
Under the garb of love,
justice and righteousness

211
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:08,680
you want to snatch
my right from me, Pandu!

212
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,648
You want to become king!

213
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,821
This is accusations has
no merit, brother!

214
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,815
Never have l even dreamt
of such a thing.

215
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,723
Go away, Pandu

216
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:23,729
otherwise the fire
of my wrath will burn you.

217
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:26,790
Go away!

218
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,649
The Chief Minister,
the council of ministers

219
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:42,689
and the General
are aides of the King.

220
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,622
It is their duty
to follow the king.

221
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,785
When the king of a state is weak

222
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,755
the council of ministers
and the subjects

223
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,733
of the state become impudent.

224
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,637
That is why,
righteousness demands

225
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:02,573
that being complete and virtuous
is what is expected from a king.

226
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:04,839
And you are that person,
wise Vidur.

227
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:10,807
You must surely deem yourself
fit to become the king.

228
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,779
Prince of Gandhar!

229
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,726
Give Prince Shakuni a reply

230
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:30,797
Chief Minister Vidur.

231
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:44,616
The duty of a thorn is to
protect the tree, Queen Mother.

232
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,689
Neither does it have the desire

233
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:52,592
nor the strength
to take the place of a flower.

234
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,631
I am one such thorn
of the tree of this kingdom.

235
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:05,635
Whenever the question of the
kingdom's welfare will arise

236
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,740
I shall assume
the form of a thorn.

237
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:12,839
I know

238
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,616
that flowers are offered to God.

239
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:21,679
Thorns are the first ones
to be removed.

240
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,593
But that does not make me sad.

241
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:31,664
I shall always fulfill my
responsibility as a thorn.

242
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:40,866
Queen Mother

243
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:44,839
when it comes to the
royal throne of Hastinapur

244
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:49,777
I don't doubt Vidur's dedication
and devotion towards it.

245
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:54,620
You are correct, son of Ganga.

246
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:57,849
But even this throne

247
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:00,821
cannot remain vacant any longer.

248
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:02,762
That is why I suggest

249
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:05,833
brother Pandu should be
crowned as the king.
