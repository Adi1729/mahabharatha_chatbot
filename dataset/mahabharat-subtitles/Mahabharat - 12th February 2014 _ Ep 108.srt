1
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,790
Stop decorating this 'mandap.'*
*A mandapa is a pillared outdoor hall or pavilion for public rituals.

2
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,690
Dhrishtadyum go tell the domestic help

3
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,910
that no marriage
will take place here.

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,690
Let's go, daughter.

5
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,610
Father, Draupadi...

6
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,450
Sister, he was Prince Arjun.

7
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,490
Those five brothers were
the sons of Pandu.

8
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,350
But they have decided
to stay hidden.

9
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,610
That is why,
I cannot tell father about it.

10
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,580
Please do not tell him either,
sister.

11
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
Please do not tell him.

12
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,420
Whoever they were, Draupadi...

13
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,350
After what they did

14
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,390
you have no right to think
of their well-being.

15
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,350
Let's go, Draupadi.

16
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,550
One can preach righteousness but
not order its implementation.

17
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,590
Each one of us must determine
what righteousness means to us.

18
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,450
I can only aid all of you
in familiarizing

19
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,450
yourselves with righteousness.

20
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,390
Yudhishthir
if you resort to asceticism

21
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,390
then a powerful kingdom
like Hastinapur

22
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,390
will be devoid of a worthy King.

23
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,290
My sons have renounced the
kingdom on their own, My Lord.

24
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,410
We do not covet the throne.

25
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,460
This must have been your
decision, Kunti.

26
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,490
But while taking this decision
did you think even once

27
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,420
about the welfare
of the subjects?

28
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Did it ever occur to you

29
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,490
that if Duryodhan becomes King

30
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,410
then for generations to come

31
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,250
a great and powerful
kingdom like Hastinapur

32
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,360
will be ruled by selfishness
and unrighteousness?

33
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,350
No, sire.

34
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,260
My heart said that

35
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,430
nipping struggle in the bud
would be appropriate.

36
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,410
Letting your heart
rule your thoughts

37
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
and letting your head
govern your likes

38
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,360
is the first stage
of unrighteousness.

39
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,290
What do you feel about
this now, Kunti?

40
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,160
We must stop hiding like this

41
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,410
and return to Hastinapur.

42
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,210
After brother-in-law
descends from the throne

43
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,450
Yudhishthir must become
the next King.

44
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,150
Not for his personal gain

45
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,160
but to provide the subjects

46
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,340
with a worthy King.

47
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,180
Splendid.
Splendid!

48
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
But Yudhishthir and Bheem...

49
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,190
If both of them
resort to asceticism

50
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,120
then Duryodhan will
certainly be the next King

51
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,150
because Arjun is younger to him.
He has no right to the throne.

52
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,360
And on the other hand
if, apart from Yudhishthir

53
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,120
the remaining brothers
resort to asceticism

54
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,120
then who will protect
Yudhishthir?

55
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,380
Pardon me, My Lord

56
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,090
but is it necessary to discuss
politics at the moment?

57
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,190
It is unnecessary!

58
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,250
Pardon me, My Lord

59
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,160
but why is the decision
of marriage

60
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,280
being weighed on
the scales of politics?

61
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,240
That too when

62
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,050
it is such a dreadful situation
for Princess Draupadi.

63
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,190
Politics is also a method
of ensuring social welfare.

64
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,280
And it is as vital
as righteousness.

65
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,250
When facing a dreadful situation

66
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,160
if one forgets to think
of social welfare

67
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,150
and thinks only of himself
then is it correct?

68
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,240
Answer me.

69
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
No.

70
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,280
But My Lord...

71
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,060
Whenever the thought
of Princess Draupadi

72
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,180
comes into my mind

73
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,020
I fail to console myself,
oh revered one.

74
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,060
Becoming the wife to five men...
How can it be easy?

75
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,990
How can we make a woman
lead such a life?

76
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,020
Draupadi's life
will indeed be difficult...

77
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,060
Then can you five brothers
not make certain sacrifices?

78
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,090
Can you not take certain
difficult decisions

79
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,220
which will ease Draupadi's life?

80
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,890
If the decision to make
such a big sacrifice

81
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,790
was taken by Draupadi herself

82
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,720
then why are all of you
declining it?

83
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,780
Are you afraid of something?

84
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,750
Or does it involve
a selfish motive?

85
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,890
But My Lord, subjects follow
in the King's footsteps.

86
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,690
This will become a tradition.

87
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,630
Many women will be
forced to do so.

88
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,750
Would it be correct?

89
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,630
It would indeed
be incorrect, Prince

90
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,630
but at the moment

91
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,760
a major trouble
surrounds all of you.

92
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,730
The righteousness one resorts to
in times of trouble

93
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,660
can be referred to as
a duty in face of peril.

94
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,730
According to this

95
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,700
many such deeds are committed

96
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,600
which, under
normal circumstances

97
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,630
would be a grave sin.

98
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,690
If another woman will be married

99
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,650
to more than one man

100
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,560
then all those men will be
fated to a life in hell.

101
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,760
But for all of you,
this is not a typical situation.

102
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,730
Then its solution
may also be atypical.

103
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,760
What kind of a path
is this, My Lord?

104
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,820
How can the wife
of my younger brother

105
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,830
be deemed my own?

106
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Instead of revering
the wife of my elder brother

107
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,790
as my own mother

108
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,660
how can I deem her
my wife, My Lord?!

109
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
How?

110
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,790
An urn is placed
between three pillars

111
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,790
and the Almighty's idol
is placed below the urn.

112
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,530
The idol is secure
from all five directions.

113
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,530
To whom is that idol
connected, Bheem?

114
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,550
To all of them

115
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,560
yet to none.

116
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Similarly

117
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,560
can you not deem Draupadi

118
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,630
the idol in your life?

119
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,750
Do remember, Bheem.

120
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,550
The temple's idol sanctifies
the urn and the pillars.

121
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,700
The urn and the pillars
do not sanctify the idol.

122
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,720
What is your decision now,
sons of Pandu?

123
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,530
'If you resort to asceticism'

124
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,650
'then a powerful kingdom
like Hastinapur'

125
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,420
'will be devoid
of a worthy King.'

126
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,650
'If Duryodhan becomes King'

127
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,420
'then for generations to come'

128
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,690
'a great and powerful
kingdom like Hastinapur'

129
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,550
'will be ruled by selfishness
and unrighteousness.'

130
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,690
'Then can you five brothers'

131
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,490
'not make certain sacrifices?'

132
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,600
'Can you not take
certain difficult decisions'

133
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,600
'which will ease
Draupadi's life?'

134
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,600
'Can you not deem Draupadi'

135
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,490
'the idol in your life?'

136
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,660
'After brother-in-law
descends from the throne'

137
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,530
'Yudhishthir must become
the next King.'

138
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,620
'Not for his personal gain'

139
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,660
'but to provide the subjects
with a worthy King.'

140
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,650
'If you resort to asceticism...
- After brother-in-law'

141
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,490
'descends from the throne...
- Who will protect Yudhishthir?'

142
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,390
'Yudhishthir must become
the next King.'

143
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,400
'Not for his personal gain...
- If Duryodhan becomes King'

144
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,550
'then for generations to come'

145
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,490
'a great and powerful
kingdom like Hastinapur'

146
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,530
'will be ruled by selfishness
and unrighteousness.'

147
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,360
'Not for his personal gain'

148
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,590
'but to provide the subjects
with a worthy King.'

149
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,420
We must go to Kampilya

150
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,500
and bear the cloak

151
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,520
of asceticism
called life, sage.

152
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,420
And this will establish
righteousness.

153
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,360
Go on, sons of Pandu.

154
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,360
Bless you!

155
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,740
Dhrishtadyumna!

156
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,710
What is your order, father?

157
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,480
Those five 'Brahmins'
are approaching

158
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,450
who have had the nerve to
insult the Princess of Panchal.

159
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,450
Get the troops ready!

160
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,670
Soldiers!

161
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,420
The way throwing away
rotten food

162
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,640
does not result
in committing a sin!

163
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Similarly

164
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,620
killing 'Brahmins'
indulged in unrighteousness

165
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,580
does not result
in committing a sin!

166
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,620
It helps one earn merits!

167
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Today

168
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,490
by killing the five 'Brahmins'
approaching Kampilya

169
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,510
all of you

170
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,580
shall be recipients of merit!

171
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,510
All hail Mahadev!

172
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,480
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!

173
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,380
How dare you come here?

174
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,380
Who gave you the right
to enter Kampilya?!

175
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,480
After insulting
my daughter so gravely

176
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,570
forget about Kampilya...

177
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,520
None of you will find a place to
stay in the entire Aryan region!

178
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,570
King Drupad.

179
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,380
These five 'Brahmins'

180
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,370
are none

181
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,510
but the Princes of Hastinapur

182
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,420
the sons of King Pandu.

183
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,280
And that is Arjun

184
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,480
to whom you had dreamt
of having your daughter married.
