1
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
The boundaries of the
province aren't its limits

2
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,360
but its identity.

3
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,460
Respecting
and understanding it

4
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,470
is the duty of every prince.

5
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,460
In face of an enemy's attack

6
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,360
what should be
a king's first reaction?

7
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,400
Ashwatthama?

8
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,300
If the enemy is weak

9
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,340
battling against and defeating
him is the best option.

10
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,200
If strong, a diplomacy
is the best course.

11
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,260
The enemy can never be strong.

12
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,400
Strength isn't just measured
on physical terms, prince.

13
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,460
A wealthier one
is also stronger.

14
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,260
Master, there's no gain in being
diplomatic with a stronger foe.

15
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,270
Because a stronger person
considers it a weakness

16
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,240
and doesn't respect
a diplomacy.

17
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,290
That will weaken us in strength
and self-confidence.

18
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,270
By being diplomatic with
a weaker person

19
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,170
the subjects of both kingdoms

20
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,430
are benefitted by trade
and others.

21
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,430
The weaker person never
violates the diplomacy.

22
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,400
Thus, a diplomacy with
a weaker person is justified

23
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,360
and battling a stronger foe
justifies bravery.

24
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,290
But only a single behaviour
is just for any foe, master.

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,230
Be it strong or weak.

26
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,360
Whoever falls in here
can't get out.

27
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
Bhim will also have
a similar death bed.

28
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,190
Why did you stop?

29
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,100
It's dusk, master.

30
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,100
I can't see the target now.

31
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,230
That means your eyes limit you.

32
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,160
A warrior must know his limits.

33
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,100
Not my eyes, master

34
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,260
the darkness is my limit.

35
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,260
If one is unable to break
a stone by his hands

36
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,230
is the limiting factor
the hands or the stone?

37
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,090
Who's sharpening
his weapons now?

38
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,960
It must be Arjun.

39
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,070
He has been freed of the task
of herding cattle, after all.

40
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
That's so unfair, brother.

41
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,160
We'd herd cattle
and he'd gain knowledge?

42
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,190
Fool!

43
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,000
The master's orders
shouldn't be called unfair!

44
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,070
The sad thing is, we are,
after all, students

45
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,100
but you... Ashwatthama, why
is Arjun being your obstacle?

46
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,190
The amount of time Arjun gets
to practice, must be yours.

47
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,130
My very words.

48
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,140
Arjun is anyway our enemy

49
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
and he's an enemy of
friend Ashwatthama too.

50
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,970
Arjun is an enemy of us all.

51
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,940
What if I kill him with
my arrow right now?

52
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,000
I can fire arrows
guided by sound.

53
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,130
Guided by sound?
What do you mean?

54
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean, the source
of sound in utter darkness

55
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,900
becomes the target for my arrow.

56
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,040
Just like King Dashrath's arrow

57
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,900
had hit Shravan.*
Name of the boy mistakenly killed by Rama's father, King Dashrath (in epic Ramayana).

58
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,960
But without challenging,
it's improper to attack.

59
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,160
That's what master had said.

60
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,870
But that rule is for warriors.

61
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,900
Ashwatthama is
after all a Brahmin.

62
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,970
That's right, friend.

63
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Here you go.

64
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,040
I'll remove a thorn in
your side right away.

65
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,870
How did he do that?

66
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,890
Through the sound of
my bowstring he came to know

67
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,060
that an arrow was being shot.

68
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,070
When did he gain this knowledge?

69
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,000
We should leave
before he comes here.

70
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,970
Something needs to
be done about him.

71
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,860
Arjun!

72
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,030
He is here. Then who was
the archer in the forest?

73
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,830
My cow is tied here!

74
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,600
How dare you tie
your cows here?

75
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,800
Brother Dushashan, this cow
is neither mine nor yours.

76
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,630
It is the master's.

77
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,600
The cow that the master charged
me with will be tied here!

78
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,630
Move!

79
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,690
Guru Drona!

80
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,440
Brother!
- Brother!

81
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,400
Brother!
- Brother Bhim! - Brother Bhim!

82
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,490
Brother Bhim!

83
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,440
Brother Bhim, give me
your hand.

84
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,590
Brother, hold my hand!
- Help me, Nakul!

85
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,400
Brother, grab my hand!

86
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,640
Brother, brother Bhim
has fallen into the quagmire!

87
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,500
Brother, grab my hand!

88
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,360
Give me your hand!

89
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,390
Brother! - Brother Bhim!
- Brother!

90
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,390
Brother Bhim!
- Brother Bhim! - Bhim!

91
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,470
Bhim, don't try to get out.

92
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,400
You will sink further.

93
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,400
We'll try to find a way out.

94
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,630
Brother Bhim!

95
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,530
Master!
- Master!

96
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,590
Brother Bhim!
Brother!

97
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,330
Bhim, wait!
- Brother!

98
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Master!
Master...

99
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,390
Brother Bhim and brother
Duryodhan had a duel.

100
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,330
Brother Duryodhan made brother
Bhim fall into this mire.

101
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,340
Help me!
- Stay calm.

102
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,400
In face of a trouble,
find a way to get out of it.

103
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,330
Facing off against
an unprecedented trouble

104
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,470
is a part of education.

105
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,430
Brother!

106
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,300
Brother, help me!

107
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,470
'It's dusk, master.'

108
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,400
'I can't see the target now.'

109
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,530
'That means your eyes
limit you.'

110
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,490
'A warrior must know
his limits.'

111
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,460
'If one is unable to break
a stone by his hands'

112
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,430
'is the limiting factor
the hands or the stone?'

113
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,530
'That means your eyes
limit you.'

114
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,300
'A warrior must know
his limits... If one is...'

115
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,470
'...the hands or the stone?'

116
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,460
'That means your
eyes limit you.'

117
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,170
Brother!

118
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,130
Brother, grab this branch!
We'll pull you out.

119
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,100
Pull!

120
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,170
Arjun.

121
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,200
Wonderful, dear!

122
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,140
No one's that quick
to grasp archery.

123
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,940
You're one in a million.

124
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,140
You'll become the best
archer of the world.

125
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,110
I'll make you the best
archer of the world.

126
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,940
That's my oath, dear.

127
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,970
You'll practice with divine
weapons from tomorrow.

128
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,040
Tell Bhim and Duryodhan

129
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,910
to have a restraint on
their anger while they are here.

130
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,970
Else they would be
expelled from the seminary.

131
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,910
'Whose arrow is this?'

132
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,870
'It's not mine.'
