1
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,590
Draupadi...

2
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,400
Your duties are five times
more difficult

3
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,500
than that of an ordinary woman.

4
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,370
Thus, it would be appropriate

5
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,490
that I hand over...

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,530
...my sons to you

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,500
and retire.

8
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,330
Henceforth,

9
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,300
only you have the right to

10
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,300
advise my sons, Draupadi.

11
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Greetings, aunt.

12
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
May you prosper.

13
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,360
Parents have one great quality...

14
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,270
Patience.

15
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,440
You should be patient too.

16
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,330
I take your leave.

17
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,200
Every man faces a situation

18
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,260
when all his dreams and hopes

19
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,190
are shattered.

20
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,230
All his plans go awry

21
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,330
On the one hand,
there's righteousness

22
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,270
and the other is happiness.

23
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,330
It becomes an impasse.

24
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,330
When righteousness is
behest with problems.

25
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,190
And not being righteous
ensures happiness.

26
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,420
Think about it.

27
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,300
At times, there's a chance
to speak ill about a decent man.

28
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,400
Or get an easy opportunity

29
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,300
to steal when impoverished.

30
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,360
At times the immorality
of a powerful leader

31
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,140
or a king's attendant
comes to light.

32
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,290
Everyone faces such situations.

33
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,230
Most people don't realise

34
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,200
that such a situation
is an impasse.

35
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,230
We don't experience
any struggle.

36
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,130
We are easily attracted
to happiness

37
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,360
Just the way a bee is attracted
to a flower.

38
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,230
In fact, such an impasse...

39
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,330
...is the best time
to get closer to God.

40
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,260
If we don't fear having
to struggle

41
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,330
and are not attracted
towards happiness

42
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,330
and continue to be righteous

43
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,170
we are not too far
from meeting God.

44
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,090
When a leaf falls from a tree
while fighting the breeze

45
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
it goes towards the sky.

46
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,300
Whereas the grass that bows to
the breeze remains on land.

47
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,290
In other words,
during an impasse

48
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
choosing the easy path

49
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,290
ensures happiness

50
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,060
and an extended life

51
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,330
but doesn't it become
a blot on character?

52
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,230
Does it not darken the soul?

53
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,300
Doesn't it distance us from God?

54
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,130
Think about it

55
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Your Highness!

56
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,190
Your Highness...

57
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,040
Duryodhan has taken
a terrible oath.

58
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,230
It will be disastrous.

59
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,160
It is pure evil,
my dear sister.

60
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,190
What's the matter,
brother Shakuni?

61
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,090
What is Duryodhan up to?

62
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,070
My dear sister, Duryodhan has
lost control over himself.

63
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,190
Your Highness,
at Drupad's kingdom...

64
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,970
The insult that Duryodhan
had to bear

65
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,970
has hurt his feelings badly.

66
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,060
I tried a lot to stop him

67
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,160
but it was no use.
No use at all, Your Highness.

68
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,970
Hastinapur insulted
in Drupad's kingdom?

69
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,160
Yes, Your Highness...

70
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,990
All the kings and princes were
seated near the podium

71
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,930
whereas Hastinapur
was placed at the very end.

72
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,000
Not only that...

73
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,100
My dear sister, even during
the 'Swayamvar'

74
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,100
all the Aryan kings and princes
were called first.

75
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,200
And Hastinapur

76
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,990
was the last.

77
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,100
It felt as if Drupad knew

78
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,900
that Hastinapur is...

79
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,090
...no longer powerful.

80
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,900
The Kuru kingdom
has become weak.

81
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,100
Your crown prince...

82
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,870
...isn't worthy of respect.

83
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,100
That's it!

84
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,100
Because of the hurt caused
by this insult

85
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,060
Duryodhan is about
to sacrifice

86
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,900
the white horse of
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.

87
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,840
That's a greater sin than
killing a Brahman, My Lord.

88
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,890
Stop him!

89
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,920
Killing a Brahman!

90
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,870
It is a greater sin than

91
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,990
killing 1,00,000 Brahmans.

92
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,920
But...

93
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,000
It's not
Duryodhan's fault.

94
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,800
Not using your strength

95
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,800
at the right time...

96
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,840
...is a greater sin, isn't it?

97
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,800
This horse is useless,
behead it.

98
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,900
I will bathe in its blood

99
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,770
and atone for
my kingdom's weakness.

100
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
Soldier!

101
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,870
Raise your sword!

102
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,890
Stop!

103
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,170
Stop!

104
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,150
What are you doing, son?

105
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,010
Killing the horse of the
'Ashwamedha Yagna'...

106
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,210
On whose orders?

107
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,210
On the orders of
the King of Panchal Drupad.

108
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,010
Soldier, raise your sword!

109
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,140
What is this foolishness?

110
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,110
The horse of
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'

111
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,210
symbolises the power and
prestige of the entire nation.

112
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,950
It cannot be killed.

113
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,050
What is the point of
keeping this horse alive

114
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,980
when the reputation of the
Kuru empire is in tatters?

115
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,070
No one considers us powerful.

116
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,050
For the past five generations
this nation

117
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,110
has not had the courage to
perform the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.

118
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,140
How can you say that
we are powerful, father?

119
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,980
You fool!

120
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,040
Don't insult the nation!

121
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,880
Our strength evokes fear in the
hearts of our enemies even now.

122
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,140
It's just your imagination.

123
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,140
An urn lying on the floor
is not pure.

124
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,910
An idol lying outside
the temple

125
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,010
is not worshipped by anyone.

126
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,880
The urn has to be placed
at the top of a temple

127
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,870
The idol has to be in the
innermost sanctum.

128
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,010
A nation's greatness has
to be proved.

129
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,850
By performing
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.

130
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,810
Father, let free the horse of
the 'Ashwamedha'

131
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,980
tomorrow itself.

132
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,910
Any king who tries
to capture it...

133
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,040
I will defeat him and prove
the greatness

134
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,980
of the Kuru empire.

135
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,080
Duryodhan...
- That's impossible, son.

136
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,920
Your father is just
the acting king.

137
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,970
He's only the concierge to
the throne of Hastinapur.

138
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,910
He doesn't have the right
to perform

139
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,850
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.

140
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,910
A horse that can't
pull a chariot

141
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,970
or take part in battle.

142
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,880
And can't be the horse
for the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'

143
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,820
is useless, mother.

144
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,010
My father took care of
the throne

145
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,910
but he doesn't have to maintain

146
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,880
its greatness.

147
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,910
So, what's the point in
occupying the throne?

148
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,970
Hold my coronation ceremony
at dawn tomorrow.

149
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,840
And the day after I will
announce to the whole of Aryavat

150
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,770
that I am performing
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.

151
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,220
Hold my coronation ceremony
at dawn tomorrow.

152
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,060
And the day after I will
announce to the whole of Aryavat

153
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,320
that I am performing
the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'.

154
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,180
Duryodhan...
calm down, my son.

155
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,060
Grandsire has gone to
Khandavprasth

156
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
to quell King Takshak's
rebellion.

157
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,250
After his return,
I will consult him

158
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,260
and definitely take a decision.

159
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,180
Consult him!

160
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,060
Why do we need to consult him?

161
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,190
A flower doesn't consult
anyone before it blooms.

162
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,090
The evening doesn't consult
anyone before it sets in.

163
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,990
Lions don't consult anyone
before they roar!

164
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,220
Why should a nation need to
consult anyone about

165
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,120
showing its strength and beauty?

166
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,090
Father, I have pledged to
perform the 'Ashwamedha Yagna'

167
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,080
and I will have to
fulfil the pledge immediately.

168
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,050
Perform my coronation, father.

169
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,080
Perform your coronation!

170
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,180
Your father and I

171
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,060
will have to renounce everything
and become ascetics, son.

172
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,180
For the greatness of
their nation

173
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,990
kings have been known
to lay down their life.

174
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,050
Can't you lay down
your position, mother?

175
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,020
Father...

176
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,060
I can't live after being
so insulted.

177
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,930
Hear my decision.

178
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Today, this sword will either
behead this horse

179
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,930
or your son.

180
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,920
The third option is

181
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,120
that you perform my
coronation at dawn tomorrow.
