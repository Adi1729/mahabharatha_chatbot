1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,786
My life is more precious.

2
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:32,008
Dear Prince. Why are we
at such a desolate place?

3
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:35,783
You will know
soon enough, Ullok.

4
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:04,072
Fireflies.

5
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,917
They twinkle like my beloved

6
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,857
sister's eyes.

7
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,965
Now Gandhari shall never have to
fear darkness, Ullok.

8
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,031
Catch them all.

9
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,010
Shukra.

10
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,046
Shukra.

11
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:49,917
My friend.

12
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:54,922
So you've brought news
from the capital.

13
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:11,778
Dhritarashtra?

14
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,819
Dhritarashtra!

15
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,797
Dhritarashtra!

16
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:29,857
Dhritarashtra!

17
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,038
I heard that Bheeshma,
the son of Ganga

18
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:45,008
had been to lay siege
on Vidarbha.

19
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,885
Not Vidarbha,
he'd been to Gandhar instead.

20
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:52,012
Have the Kuru's ever
attacked anyone?

21
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,054
Bheeshma had been there
with a marriage proposal.

22
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:14,806
Greetings, grandfather. - May
you live long, Dhritarashtra.

23
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,871
Greetings, grandfather.
- Vidur.

24
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,983
Greetings, grandfather.
- Pandu.

25
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:31,886
Greetings, mother.

26
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,796
What do I even bless you,
my prodigal son?

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,968
A blessing for a long life
is futile

28
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,870
for you have a boon,
to choose your death at will.

29
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,797
A mother always
blesses for happiness.

30
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:46,001
As long as the throne of
Hastinapur lies vacant

31
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,870
how can I ever
be truly happy?

32
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:53,883
An orchard
full of fruit laden trees

33
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,918
And a derelict throne,
without a king

34
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,979
suffer the same
ill fate, Bheeshma.

35
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,825
The one who bears the duty
of guarding either of these two

36
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,894
shall forever be sleepless.

37
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,901
I'd sent you to find the path
to our happiness, Bheeshma.

38
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:15,966
Has the king of Gandhar arrived
with Gandhari? - Mother.

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,224
They couldn't come along.

40
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:23,236
King Subal pleaded with me,
that he wishes to conduct

41
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,074
Gandhari's wedding with great
pomp and splendour.

42
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:31,110
He shall bring his entire family
along with Gandhari

43
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,180
and arrive in Hastinapur, before
the eve of 'Akshaytritiya'

44
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:39,315
Besides, after so many years

45
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,155
this would be the first wedding
in our clan too.

46
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:46,285
Even we shall have to invite
Kings from other kingdoms.

47
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:51,289
If you'd brought them along,
I'd be even happier.

48
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,331
But I hope you did
what you felt was right.

49
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,036
Ambika.

50
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:04,109
Commence with the
preparations for the wedding

51
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,304
of your eldest son,
Dhritarashtra.

52
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:10,312
Daughter-in-law, before
king Subal arrives here

53
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:15,055
have a token of ornaments and
other gifts sent to Gandhar.

54
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:16,247
As you say,
mother-in-law.

55
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:24,094
I'm feeling very glad today,
elder brother.

56
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,226
Even I am very glad,
Bheeshma.

57
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:32,297
Now the throne of Hastinapur
shall forever be secured.

58
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:39,179
The promise I had made to your
father, shall be fulfilled now.

59
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:41,274
Gandhari's hundred sons

60
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,085
shall brighten the Kuru clan's
future for eternity.

61
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:51,091
Pandu. Convey the good news to
the royal teacher Kripacharya.

62
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,289
Also command the announcer Uttam
to announce across the kingdom.

63
00:05:56,198 --> 00:06:00,225
On the eve of 'Akshaytritiya'
prince Dhritarashtra's wedding

64
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:03,304
to princess Gandhari,
shall be solemnised.

65
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:06,140
Soon thereafter

66
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,235
Dhritarashtra
shall be crowned and enthroned

67
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,246
as the king of
Hastinapur.

68
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:47,238
'Long live the king!'

69
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:52,184
'Long live the king!'

70
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,253
Pandu.
- Greetings, elder brother.

71
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:02,230
Do you know how many steps
you need to take

72
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,325
to reach the throne
from where you're standing?

73
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,160
No, brother.

74
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:12,206
Fifty-one.

75
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,272
One, two, three..

76
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,208
four, five.

77
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,087
I have measured the distance
to the throne

78
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:30,122
from every door
within this room.

79
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:35,162
Six, seven, eight..

80
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,190
Nine, ten.

81
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,068
Do you know why?

82
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:46,299
Because right since birth, I had
been heading to this throne.

83
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,043
20, 21, 22..

84
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:55,215
46, 47, 48

85
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,314
49, 50, 51.

86
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:07,251
But how far is it now?
Tell me.

87
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:14,063
Fifty-one steps?
- No. lt's one.

88
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,137
Just one.

89
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:22,270
And the name of that one step
is wedding.

90
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:29,113
Then I shall be seated there,
upon my throne.

91
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:41,543
The biggest dream of my life
shall come true, Pandu.

92
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:47,482
And then, she shall sit there

93
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,484
as my eyes.

94
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:54,455
My Queen.

95
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:14,417
A token of ornaments and drapes
have arrived from Hastinapur

96
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:15,578
for you, princess.

97
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:20,322
Look at them, princess. They're
such beautiful ornaments.

98
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:30,424
Yes, they're very beautiful
indeed.

99
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:34,366
They truly befit the status
of the queen of Hastinapur.

100
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:39,340
When you shall wear this and sit
upon the throne of Hastinapur

101
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:43,479
your beauty shall be celestial,
princess.

102
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:51,511
I'm a royal princess.
Someday I had to be a queen.

103
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:57,492
But you have no experience
with ruling, princess.

104
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:01,325
Then how shall you rule?

105
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,363
It's very simple.

106
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,560
Where there's no experience,
affection comes in handy.

107
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,506
With my devout affection

108
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,599
I shall win the hearts of
the subjects of Hastinapur.

109
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:16,603
Right now, l'm not concerned for
Hastinapur's subjects.

110
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:25,452
I wish to rule the heart
of my beloved husband.

111
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,492
Winning the subjects' heart
is easier, princess.

112
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:33,588
But winning the heart
of your husband

113
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,394
especially when
he's a king himself

114
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:39,500
is a little difficult.

115
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,337
All the beautiful damsels
in the world

116
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,340
must be flocking
around him.

117
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:47,408
I'm not afraid
of that competition.

118
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,606
If that were the case,
Hastinapur wouldn't travel here

119
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,408
all the way to Gandhar,
to choose me.

120
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,556
I shall get him so spell bound
with my beauty

121
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,383
that the Kuru prince's eyes
shall only look at me.

122
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:08,362
Then through her eyes,
l shall look at the royal court.

123
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:13,560
Even when a person
is quiet

124
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:17,532
he says a lot through the
expressions on his face, Pandu.

125
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:21,538
My wife shall be my eyes,
and read the expressions

126
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:24,445
on the faces of the courtiers.

127
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:32,413
I'm glad, elder brother, that
you shall soon get your eyes.

128
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:37,424
Anyway, you do not trust
your younger brother.

129
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,452
No, brother.
lt's not so.

130
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,498
I trust you completely.

131
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:47,469
But, you shall not be
with me always.

132
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:50,567
Sometimes you shall be at war,
as the commander-in-chief.

133
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:54,342
And sometimes, you shall
be off for leisurely travel.

134
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:02,349
And l need eyes that shall
stay with me always, brother.

135
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:03,612
Incessantly.

136
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,557
A husband needs a wife
at every step, elder brother.

137
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:18,401
A wife heeds her husband
in transactional matters.

138
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,493
She stands by him
during religious deeds.

139
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:25,440
And shows him the path
to redemption.

140
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:30,374
A wife's arrival fulfils
a husband's life, elder brother.

141
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,439
These are all useless talks,
Pandu.

142
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,518
Power.

143
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,521
Power is supreme
in transactional matters.

144
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:42,483
That is the foundation
for religion.

145
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,526
And the path to redemption.

146
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,365
That's all.

147
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,591
There is no need
for a wife, for that.

148
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:58,474
For me, the significance
of my wife is just that

149
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:01,435
she shall fulfill this

150
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:05,347
one thing l lack.

151
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,542
That's all.

152
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:13,523
There shall be nothing
more precious than me

153
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:15,491
for my husband,
Sugdha.

154
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:22,496
The way father consults mother
regarding every matter

155
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:29,394
my husband too shall consult me
regarding every decision.

156
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:36,606
We shall teach our sons about
good values and happiness.

157
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:44,386
My husband shall show me
around his entire kingdom.

158
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:51,623
He shall hold my hand
and walk ahead.

159
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:57,499
And I shall lay my every step
upon his shadow.

160
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,529
As the eldest brother and
his beloved wife

161
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,370
the journey of our lives
shall be truly successful.

162
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,543
The foundation of all human
relationships

163
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,547
is expectation.

164
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:23,423
A husband, who could fill
life with joy and prosperity.

165
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:27,495
A wife, who is always
dedicated and loyal.

166
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:32,562
Children, who shall always serve
and obey.

167
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,403
Human being.

168
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:42,578
An individual usually
loves the person

169
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,314
who meets his expectations.

170
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:47,608
But expectations are destined
to be broken.

171
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:50,353
How?

172
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:55,415
Because expectations
originate from the human mind.

173
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:59,519
No one else ever learns
of those expectations.

174
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:04,433
In spite of all intentions
to fulfill them

175
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,435
one can never fulfill
another's expectations.

176
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:11,363
And that is the root

177
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,441
of conflict.

178
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,573
All relationships

179
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,576
turn into conflict.

180
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,454
If humans stop building

181
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:27,389
their relationships
based on expectations

182
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:32,419
and accept relationships
solely for what they are

183
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:36,396
won't this life be full of

184
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,502
peace and happiness?

185
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:44,335
Think about it.

186
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,087
Shukra.

187
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:03,001
Look, Sugdha. We just spoke
about brother Shakuni.

188
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,903
And he's already sent
a message.

189
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:14,878
So many fireflies?

190
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:17,916
You see, Sugdha?

191
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,054
Brother Shakuni went through
so much of trouble for me.

192
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:26,023
Just so that my chamber
shouldn't get dark.

193
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,095
Even brother Shakuni must
have surely arrived.

194
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:44,041
Shakuni. Son, we were
waiting for you.

195
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:47,078
What is the use of waiting now,
mother?

196
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,091
Son, control your anger.

197
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:54,086
A huge army had arrived from
Hastinapur, with the proposal.

198
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:56,996
And Bheeshma himself
was supervising them.

199
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:01,893
We had no other choice
than to accept the proposal.

200
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:07,874
Son, your father shall
explain the situation.

201
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,935
Who shall explain?

202
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:15,905
A father or a king?

203
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:27,994
Shakuni. A king cannot ignore
his royal obligations.

204
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:32,023
You said it right, father.
lt was your royal obligation.

205
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:37,037
To marry beloved Gandhari
to Dhritarashtra.

206
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:39,903
It was only your
royal obligation.

207
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,107
She's a daughter who gave you
so much of love and respect.

208
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:48,082
And you are being
unjust to her..

209
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,909
It's only your
royal obligation.

210
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:55,050
You are darkening the future
of my beloved sister.

211
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,023
It's only your
royal obligation.

212
00:17:57,892 --> 00:17:59,120
What use is
a royal obligation

213
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,863
where you need to sacrifice
the royal family?

214
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:05,899
Where is your
greatness now?

215
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,867
Where is your strength,
king Subal?

216
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,867
Or are you consumed by the greed
to expand your kingdom

217
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:20,938
with the aid of
Hastinapur?

218
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,110
And has that greed overpowered

219
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,850
your love for your daughter?

220
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,953
Answer me.

221
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,022
I love my daughter Gandhari
too, son.

222
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:43,099
And I had to come to that
decision with a heavy heart.

223
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:47,098
Because emotions
make you blind.

224
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,842
You must give up emotions and
think about the circumstances.

225
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:53,937
Tomorrow you shall be
the king of Gandhar.

226
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,016
And as the king of Gandhar
you cannot be blind

227
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,109
to Gandhar's future.

228
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,945
I do not fear Bheeshma.

229
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:03,048
Father, when might fails

230
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:06,083
one must use deception.

231
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,954
I shall attack the kingdom

232
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,898
of Hastinapur so cleverly

233
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:15,892
that the entire kingdom
shall be reduced to a rubble.

234
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,104
I do not respect
any such obligation

235
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:29,072
that is a hindrance in
my beloved sister's future.

236
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:33,851
Even if I have to do the
most disgusting deeds

237
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,856
for the sake of Gandhari,
I'm willing to do it.

238
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,018
I will gladly accept hell.

239
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,021
But I shall not let my beloved

240
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:46,898
sister's future be darkened.

241
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:50,061
I will never allow Gandhari

242
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:54,097
to marry a man who is
blind since birth.

243
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,808
Never.

244
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:09,987
Gandhari
