1
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,060
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

2
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,070
Bless you.

3
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,100
Goodbye, grandfather.

4
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,990
May you live long.

5
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Goodbye, father.

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,970
May you be victorious, son.

7
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,000
May you be victorious.

8
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,030
Goodbye, uncle.

9
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,910
Bless you.
- Goodbye, teacher.

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,070
May you be victorious.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Goodbye, grandfather.

12
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,130
Goodbye.
May you be victorious.

13
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,900
Princes

14
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,070
this is the first battle
of your lives.

15
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,930
All the art and knowledge
taught by me

16
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,870
and even your might
will seem scant in this battle

17
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,830
because your opponent

18
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,900
is my friend Drupad.

19
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,800
From my revered father

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,060
the great sage Bharadwaj

21
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,010
Drupad learnt the same art

22
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,030
which all of you
have learnt from me.

23
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,870
Me and my son Ashwatthama

24
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,900
will not take part
in this battle

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,900
because Drupad had told me

26
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
that if I am proud of my art

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,800
then I needed
to generate a warrior

28
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,000
who could defeat him.

29
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,000
And I have
accepted his challenge.

30
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,840
All of you

31
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,810
must uphold the honour
of your teacher.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,740
If anyone is fearful
of this battle then

33
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,800
I release that person
from the duty

34
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,830
of Paying my fee.

35
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,520
Is there anyone

36
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,360
who doubts my teachings

37
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,480
or has no faith
in his own ability?

38
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,770
Is there anyone?

39
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,670
We have faith, teacher!

40
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,900
We have faith, teacher!

41
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,740
Splendid.

42
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,740
All of you may proceed
for the battle.

43
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,830
But the sons of Dhritarashtra

44
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,900
must go back.

45
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,770
Father, what are you saying?

46
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,830
What kind of partiality is this?

47
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,730
It is not partiality.

48
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,640
It is not partiality at all!

49
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,740
One who doubts my teachings

50
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,760
and has no faith
in his own capability

51
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,610
cannot be accepted by me
as my disciple.

52
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,600
I cannot ask for my fee
from such a person, Ashwatthama.

53
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,830
If I had to defeat Drupad
by any means possible

54
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,700
then I would have approached
the King of Hastinapur

55
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,740
as a trader intent on
making a business deal.

56
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,670
I would not have meditated
and waited all these years.

57
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,800
But we have
complete faith, teacher.

58
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,730
In order to protect oneself, if
one is accompanied by a warrior

59
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,800
who is not my disciple

60
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,510
I do not deem it faith, Prince.

61
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,510
I have no faith in his archery

62
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,570
because I did not
teach him that.

63
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,730
I do not know from where
he learnt the art.

64
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,540
Hence, if you lose
because of him

65
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,730
I will be the one
to be humiliated.

66
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,570
And even if you win
because of him

67
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,570
I will still be humiliated.

68
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,140
'The Region of Arya.'

69
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,200
'North, North-East,
East, South-East'

70
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,380
'South, South-West,
West, North-West.'

71
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,370
'Vidarbh, Kunti,

72
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Hastinapur.'

73
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,370
'Ganges,
Panchal

74
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,310
City of Kampilya.'

75
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,240
Is Drupad really that illusory

76
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,250
brother Arjun?

77
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,300
Those who
do not trust their eyesight

78
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,210
their vision cannot be
restrained by anything.

79
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,110
The biggest victory is

80
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
to gain victory
over one's senses.

81
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,170
Learn to control your senses
like me, Sahadev.

82
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,170
One who does not seek
any happiness in his life

83
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,140
cannot be defeated by anyone.

84
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,110
Would you like to have
a 'laddoo,' brother Bheem?

85
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,240
'Laddoo!'
Where is it?

86
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,270
Do you have one?
Could I have it?

87
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
This is my brother

88
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,080
who seeks no happiness
in this world.

89
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,970
I have taken the oath of
not eating 'laddoos,' brother.

90
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,240
I shall not even
think about them.

91
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,140
I might think about them
but I won't eat any

92
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,210
until we defeat Drupad

93
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,980
and have you
coronated as the Prince.

94
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,050
'Panchal.'

95
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,500
We shall make use
of the spiral formation.

96
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
We shall divide ourselves
into three battalions.

97
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,080
The first battalion,
comprising me, shall lead.

98
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,040
Dusshasan

99
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,580
you shall lead
the second battalion.

100
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,980
Your battalion will be behind
mine in the southern direction.

101
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,980
Vikarna

102
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,010
your battalion shall be
in the north

103
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,700
and will attack
from that direction.

104
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,360
In order to navigate
through any labyrinth

105
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,460
the 'Sharvyooh'* is the most efficient one.
*Chakravyuh or Padmavyuh, is a multi-tier defensive formation that looks like a blooming lotus (padma, पद्म) or disc (chakra, चक्र).

106
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,760
Drupad will certainly be
at the center of his army.

107
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,140
I

108
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,070
need to reach him.

109
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,150
Friend Duryodhan

110
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,050
before we defeat Drupad,
we must defeat his General.

111
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,950
I have heard

112
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,070
that Drupad's General
is immortal.

113
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,000
No one is immortal.

114
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,010
But Drupad's General cannot die.

115
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,970
It is due to an oath
taken in his past life.

116
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,930
And until he fulfills it

117
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,980
he won't die.

118
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,010
And that is why

119
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,980
Drupad has made him his General.

120
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,980
No matter how many times
the enemies kill him

121
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,140
he rises up every single time.

122
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,140
And upon seeing this miracle

123
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,940
their enemies run away
out of fright.

124
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,910
Friend, if we tie him up with a 'Paashastra'*
Snare tactic.

125
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,880
then defeating Drupad
will not be impossible.

126
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,140
Vikarna, do you know
how to use a 'Paashastra'?

127
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,030
I do know, brother

128
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
but I have no faith in me.

129
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,030
But Arjun knows.

130
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,110
To win with the help of Arjun

131
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,910
is to be defeated, friend.

132
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,970
Do remember, Dusshasan.

133
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,810
Under all circumstances

134
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,040
Drupad must be defeated
only at my hands.

135
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,810
This is mandatory.

136
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,840
But how will you
achieve this, friend?

137
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,900
Yudhishthir is the eldest.

138
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,940
He will also be
the General of your army.

139
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,810
And you will have to fight
according to his strategies.

140
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
In other words,
under all circumstances

141
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,880
Yudhishthir is bound to win.

142
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,300
Did you hear, General?

143
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,330
Drona is arriving here

144
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,130
with the Princes of Hastinapur.

145
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,370
They are only 105 princes

146
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,160
but you have

147
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,370
two limitless armies with you.

148
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,110
Take them in as prisoners.

149
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,360
Then Bhishma will come

150
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,370
to save them.

151
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,270
The aim of your life
will be fulfilled

152
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
and Panchal will take over
the kingdom of Hastinapur.

153
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,210
'I am here as the representative
of the kingdom of Hastinapur.'

154
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,980
'I have come here on behalf
of Prince Vichitravirya'

155
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,200
'to ask for the hands
of your daughters in marriage.'

156
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,200
'If any of the Kings
present here disagree with me'

157
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,070
'then that King has the right
to challenge me.'

158
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
'A true warrior
can never pass up'

159
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,940
'an opportunity for a combat,
son of Ganga!'

160
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,940
'I have accepted King Shalv!
as my husband with my heart.'

161
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,100
'That I'll choose King Shalv as
my husband in this 'swayamvar'

162
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,170
'had already been decided.'

163
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,980
'You have won me in the court
by displaying your might.'

164
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,970
'Now, if I am to be married'

165
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,010
'it will be only with you,
son of Ganga, Bhishma!'

166
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,940
'But this is not possible.'

167
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,170
'I have taken
a vow of celibacy.'

168
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,070
'And I am here to break
that very vow, Bhishma.'

169
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,910
'You should seek the help
of my teacher, Lord Parashuram'

170
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,140
'and if I am guilty'

171
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,070
'then only one person
is capable of punishing me'

172
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,110
'namely, my teacher
Lord Parashuram.'

173
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,970
'Until the solution
to my problem is found'

174
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,980
'Lord Parashuram
must continue this battle.'

175
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,100
'My Lord,
fulfill this wish of mine.'

176
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,930
'I wish to see him dead,
Mahadev.'

177
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,100
'I wish to be
the reason of his death.'

178
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,100
'Aiming at a higher goal'

179
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,930
'or more a noble deed'

180
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,010
'when you wish
the death of Bhishma'

181
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,010
'you will certainly become
the reason of his demise.'

182
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,870
'Then I do not wish to live'

183
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,910
'but I shall return
in my next life'

184
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,840
'after 25 years.'

185
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,070
'This girl will take revenge
for my insult.'

186
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,010
'And this girl shall be
called Shikhandini.'

187
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,940
'And when your soul
will be fatigued and aged'

188
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,840
'I shall be born with
the purpose of killing you.'

189
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,030
Bhishma!
