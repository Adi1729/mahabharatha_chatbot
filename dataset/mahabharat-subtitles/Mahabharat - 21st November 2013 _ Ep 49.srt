1
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,190
'Duryodhan.'

2
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,090
The first one is

3
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,200
Prince Duryodhan!

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,000
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

5
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,160
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,190
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

7
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,000
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,100
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

9
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,090
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

10
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,930
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

11
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,030
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,960
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

13
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,900
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

15
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

16
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,990
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

17
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,130
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

18
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,930
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

19
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,100
Father, mother.

20
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,990
Greetings.

21
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,830
To fight me is difficult.

22
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,000
That is why
my name is Duryodhan.

23
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,990
I shall not allow my enemies

24
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,940
even the time to be fearful.

25
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,830
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

26
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,030
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

27
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,960
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

28
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,930
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

29
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,930
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

30
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Greetings, uncle.
Greetings.

31
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,830
May you be victorious,
my dear.

32
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
May you be victorious.

33
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,930
I was certain, uncle

34
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,730
that you shall indeed be here
to fulfill your promise.

35
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,770
And until I fulfill my promise,
my dear

36
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,000
I shall stay right here
in Hastinapur.

37
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,790
So, uncle.

38
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,960
In this victory 'yagna' of mine

39
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,840
who is the first
to be sacrificed?

40
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,790
'Nakul.'

41
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,770
Go on, my dear.
Go on.

42
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,900
The first to compete
with Prince Duryodhan

43
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,770
is Prince Nakul of the Pandavas!

44
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,760
All hail Prince Nakul!

45
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,840
Mother, brother Nakul
is on his way.

46
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,870
Do you know that
when he was in Hastinapur

47
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,770
he used to make me laugh a lot?

48
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,870
Among all my brothers,
he is the handsomest.

49
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,800
All hail Prince Nakul!

50
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,770
All hail Prince Nakul!

51
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,860
Sanjay. - All hail Prince Nakul!
- What is happening?

52
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,630
Your Majesty, Prince Nakul
just made a wondrous entrance.

53
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,830
Sanjay, what is happening
at the moment?

54
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,590
Your Majesty

55
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,700
among Prince Duryodhan
and Prince Nakul

56
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,790
Prince Duryodhan is exhibiting
greater talent and skill.

57
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,530
Wonderful, son!

58
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,570
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

59
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,760
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

60
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,630
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

61
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,530
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

62
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,660
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

63
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,530
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

64
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,630
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

65
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,640
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

66
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,530
What was the outcome?

67
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,530
Nakul lost to Duryodhan,
sister-in-law.

68
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,590
Uncle.

69
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
That was not even a competition.

70
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,600
But it was certainly the first
step towards victory, dear.

71
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,500
Who is next?

72
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,500
'Sahadev.'

73
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,660
Next is Prince Sahadev
of the Pandavas!

74
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,670
All hail Prince Sahadev!

75
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,560
All hail Prince Sahadev!

76
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,660
Sahadev?

77
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,570
Why not Bheem?

78
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,470
You must first get rid of
the smaller thorns, my darling.

79
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,460
All hail Prince Sahadev!

80
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,340
All hail Prince Sahadev!

81
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,530
All hail Prince Sahadev!

82
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,390
All hail Prince Sahadev!

83
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,560
All hail Prince Sahadev!

84
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,840
Sanjay.

85
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,070
What is happening at the moment?
- Your Majesty

86
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,970
among Prince Duryodhan
and Prince Sahadev

87
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,010
the former is exhibiting
wondrous valour.

88
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,900
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

89
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,000
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

90
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,810
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

91
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,840
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

92
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,970
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

93
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,910
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

94
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,870
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

95
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,780
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

96
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,980
Duryodhan defeated

97
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,880
my second son as well.

98
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,850
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

99
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,900
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

100
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,970
Ashwathama has given us
a new name, Nakul.

101
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,710
Now, we are not the Kauravas
but the Pandavas.

102
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,980
Nakul, I find this name
to be quite endearing.

103
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,740
It seems as though
father is with us.

104
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,970
Why? Did you not have
any premonition today?

105
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,940
I have the premonition
of victory.

106
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,940
A premonition of victory
after defeat?

107
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,740
Nakul, brother Bheem had told me

108
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,910
that if I take part in
the competition before him

109
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,810
I must not tire Duryodhan out.

110
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
He does not want
Duryodhan to say

111
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,780
that he lost to brother Bheem
because of fatigue.

112
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,700
Sire, if the third competitor
also turns out to be Pandu's son

113
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,780
then this competition
is certainly a deception.

114
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,840
This is deception.

115
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,850
Even if the names of the sons
of Dhritarashtra are announced

116
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,740
they will not fight Duryodhan.

117
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,740
All this facade

118
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,910
is only to facilitate Duryodhan
to be crowned as the prince.

119
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,780
I know this, Vidur.

120
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,730
But...

121
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,700
But the orders of the king

122
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,670
have left me
with no alternative.

123
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,780
Now, it is Yudhishthir's turn,
my darling.

124
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,850
I will oust him from
the competition in no time.

125
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,770
But if you are unable to do so
then do remember

126
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,740
that people who take pride
in their beauty

127
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,780
are afraid of their reflection

128
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,800
lest they see
their own ugliness.

129
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,840
If you try to corrupt
Yudhishthir's interior

130
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,640
then success will be
an easy one.

131
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,800
'Yudhishthir.'

132
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,680
Yudhishthir?
- Mother Kunti.

133
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,810
Why are brother Dusshasan
and the rest not here?

134
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,680
And between whom is this
competition taking place?

135
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,710
Maybe between your father
and uncle Pandu.

136
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,610
How can that be possible?

137
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,650
Father has not even gone
to take part in the competition.

138
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,740
And is uncle going
to descend from heaven?

139
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,840
Be quiet, Dushala.

140
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,740
Watch the competition.

141
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,580
I have given you my word
to stay quiet, son.

142
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Let my name and my fame
not get tarnished.

143
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,630
Indeed, father.

144
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,800
Whether Duryodhan wins
or someone else does

145
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,580
your glory is bound to magnify.

146
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,060
Next is Prince Yudhishthir
of the Pandavas!

147
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,090
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

148
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,220
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

149
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,250
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

150
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,050
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

151
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,120
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

152
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,220
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

153
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,220
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

154
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,190
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

155
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,060
Your Majesty, Prince Duryodhan
and Prince Yudhishthir

156
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,880
are exhibiting equal valour
in the competition.

157
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,890
Both of them are at par
in their skills, your Majesty.

158
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,990
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

159
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,080
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

160
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,850
Try to recollect my words,
Duryodhan.

161
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,950
Recollect my words.

162
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,790
Yudhishthir, you truly
are very powerful.

163
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,920
The blood of which dynasty
runs through your veins?

164
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,910
From whom did your characterless
