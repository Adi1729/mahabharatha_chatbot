1
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,200
Mother, Vasuki told me

2
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,110
to crush the heads of my enemies

3
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,240
in a similar way on
the battlefield.

4
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,080
Nakul, I hope you
understand crushing.

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Powder!

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,010
Which on being consumed
cleanses the stomach.

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,130
Brother Bheem...

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,070
How can you laugh in such
an alarming situation?

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,970
Doesn't your blood boil
with anger?

10
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,100
Anger?

11
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,200
I am so angry that my
palms may emit fire

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
that is why I was
laughing, brother.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,180
The sinners aren't aware

14
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,140
that Bheem has become stronger than Hanuman* himself.
*A central character in the epic Ramayana. Vayu is the spiritual father of Hanuman.

15
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,000
I have taken an oath.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,170
I would be the one

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
to kill the hundred brothers.

18
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,040
Quiet, Bheem.

19
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,180
It isn't appropriate for us to
talk about killing our brothers.

20
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,010
Have you forgotten
father's words?

21
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,980
Bravery lies in being merciful
and not in seeking vengeance.

22
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,110
Yudhistir, don't tell him
to be quiet today.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,140
One can forgive his enemies

24
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,030
but not his family members.

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,910
Plants come to life from water.

26
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,980
That's why wood
doesn't submerge in water.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,110
The day wood
submerges in water

28
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,130
it will be doomsday.

29
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,130
And when a family deceives

30
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,930
there arises a calamity
in the family.

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,070
There's no longer any place
for us in Hastinapur.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,130
We will now got to your
grandfather's place

33
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,010
to Kuntibhoj.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,910
Kunti, don't punish the
Kuru dynasty so severely.

35
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,040
The daughter-in-law who at
her husband's house

36
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,070
doesn't get happiness, comfort
and respect

37
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,960
not only the family

38
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,870
but the entire dynasty
is disgraced.

39
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,940
The ancestors in heaven
feel humiliated.

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,070
But, sire...

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,840
I have collected all
the information

42
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,840
from my spies.

43
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,980
The way when a part of
a body is wounded

44
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,910
the brain feels the pain.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm enduring the pain
of this incident.

46
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,910
I have decided to find a
solution to this dilemma.

47
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,930
Dear, I request you

48
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,800
please stay back.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,770
Believe me, Kunti.

50
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,970
Don't you trust me, dear?

51
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,800
Yes, sire.

52
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,770
Your majesty, couldn't you hear
my footsteps today?

53
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,830
I...

54
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Greetings, sire.

55
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,740
You shouldn't greet me
sitting on the throne!

56
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,740
Aren't you conscious
about that today?

57
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,770
Your majesty, what were you
listening to with such

58
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,710
concentration that you didn't
hear my footsteps today?

59
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,610
I...
- You were probably listening to

60
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,670
the thundering sound of the
anarchy previaling in Hastinapur

61
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,830
Or were you hearing the
cries of our august

62
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,770
ancestors in heaven,
your majesty!

63
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,610
Why are your words so harsh?
- Because I had become tough

64
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,870
and taken an oath to protect
this throne and its glory.

65
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,800
What is the problem
that makes you... - Problem?

66
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,640
Your majesty, the problem
is that you haven't

67
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,630
called the justice committee.

68
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,840
Justice?

69
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:42,870
For what?

70
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,870
My son is innocent.

71
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,740
If you were confident
that he is innocent

72
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,710
then that could be heard
in your voice, your majesty.

73
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,780
Duryodhana is just a kid.

74
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,800
When you had decided to
make him the crown prince

75
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,600
hadn't you realized then
that he is a kid.

76
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,780
King, you have to do justice!

77
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,600
Pardon me, sire.

78
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,800
What judgment shall I rule out?

79
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,540
The love for my son
weakens me.

80
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
I was born blind.

81
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,710
Distrust is my sole asset.

82
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,800
So apart from my son

83
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,540
I am unable to trust
anyone else.

84
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,730
Dear, several people in
this world are blind.

85
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,770
You are not the first.

86
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,600
But they lead their life
respectfully and independently.

87
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,770
The don't plead for mercy.

88
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,710
They have made trust
the basis of their life

89
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,510
and not discontent
like you have.

90
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,730
Please forgive my son.

91
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,630
Let me assure you

92
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,570
I take an oath that
when the time comes

93
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,700
whoever you think is eligible

94
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,740
I will declare him as
the crown prince.

95
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,540
I will not argue.

96
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,570
But please pardon my
son for now.

97
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,610
If an innocent child kicks, no
one considers it a humiliation.

98
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,640
I will be agonized to
punish him.

99
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,640
I will be heartbroken.

100
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,510
If you tell me,
I will touch Kunti's feet

101
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,680
and apologise to her.

102
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,450
But do not order me
to judge Duryodhana.

103
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,700
Do not order me
to judge my Duryodhan.

104
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,240
Do not order me
to judge my Duryodhan.

105
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
Alright.

106
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,170
I have one adequate verdict
for the both of you.

107
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,210
You have to distance
yourself from him.

108
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
That would mean

109
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,140
the way Pandu's son

110
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,200
don't have the protection
of their father

111
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,130
in the same way

112
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,040
you have to stop
protecting your sons.

113
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,070
At Guru Drona's academic
institution

114
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
all your sons would study
for twelve years.

115
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,010
And in the twelve years

116
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,170
you will not try to contact
your sons in anyway.

117
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,140
Dear, you will be the one to
take the decision

118
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,230
today itself.

119
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,870
Kripi! Ashwathama!

120
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,840
I have taken my first step
towards my dream.

121
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,910
The burden of my past that
I carry within

122
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,910
I will soon be relieved of it.

123
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,100
Ashwathama!

124
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Ashwathama.

125
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,910
Son, till now you were
destined to be impoverished.

126
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,810
Now...

127
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,840
I will see to it that you
become the king of a state.

128
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,000
With the help of these princes.

129
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,240
That's surprising!

130
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,240
The soldiers from
Gandhar are here.

131
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,210
With so many things

132
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,410
What has father sent
from Gandhar?

133
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,330
These are my belongings.

134
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,170
Who has loaded them
on the chariots?

135
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,230
These are arrangements
made for your journey

136
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,210
King Shakuni.

137
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,240
Greetings, Sir Bheeshma.

138
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,210
King Shakuni!

139
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,140
Why are you mocking me?

140
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,340
I am not mocking you.

141
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,300
Your father

142
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,140
the king of Gandhar, king
Subala has decided that

143
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,230
he will renounce his throne
and become an ascetic.

144
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,340
Thus, I addressed
you as the king.

145
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,270
Is father embracing anchorite?
Who gave you this information?

146
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,370
No one did.

147
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,140
Actually, I was the one
to send him a message

148
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,300
that it's time for him
to be an ascetic.

149
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Thus...

150
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
He will declare his son

151
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,310
which means you,
as the king.

152
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,140
And Gandhar cannot dare
to disobey my orders.

153
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,110
Thus, you have finally
become a king.

154
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,080
And

155
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,270
do you have any reason

156
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,270
for being
so kind to me, Sir Bheeshma?

157
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,330
King of Gandhar,
the reason is

158
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,140
that it's right for a king

159
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,300
to stay at his capital.

160
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,340
Your team of bodyguards
are ready

161
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,300
to take you to Gandhar.

162
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,070
Please proceed.

163
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,200
Let me seek king
Dhritarashtra's permission...

164
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,170
That isn't needed.

165
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,040
I have taken the
king's permission.

166
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,130
Let me seek Gandhari's
permission...

167
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,300
I have taken the queen's
permission

168
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,010
on your behalf.

169
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,040
Please come.

170
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,270
Are you

171
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,030
throwing me
out of Hastinapur, Sire?

172
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,070
That there's no opportunity
to expel you

173
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,010
and you don't lose respect

174
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,140
that's what I'm trying to do.

175
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Proceed.

176
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,970
Proceed!

177
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,170
Proceed!
