1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,960
If we do not fail

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
their incognito exile

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,920
then there will
be a war.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,080
Child, don't assume

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
that during that war

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,920
Arjun will fight Karna

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,120
and Bhima will fight
with you.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,160
No, my child.
No.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,440
Both the troops

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,840
will seek the help

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,360
of their other friends
who are kings.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,880
The raging armies
will come together.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,800
There will be horrifying
demolition.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,160
And even if you do win

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,440
you will not be

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,720
greatly benefited.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
A broken kingdom

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,480
a shattered empire

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,440
poverty

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,720
and struggle is all
that you will get.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,400
My child, when there
is famine

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,680
not only does the water
on the land dry up

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,960
but also one's entire life
too gets dried up.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
Hence

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,920
stop chanting about
waging a war.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
My child

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,240
I am living with the aspiration
to make you the king

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,600
of a prosperous kingdom.

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,840
No war.
Just deceit. Deceit!

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,400
King of Sindhu, Jayadratha

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,760
Dushasana

32
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,640
send your envoys
to all the states

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
of the Arya empire.

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Send your spies to every corner

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,280
of the Arya dynasty.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,280
Find them!
Where have they gone?

37
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
Those five powerful men

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,360
and the most beautiful
woman in the world

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
cannot hide

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,520
this easily.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,880
Find them!

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,880
Go look!

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,400
'Virat.'

44
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Brother, there goes my mace
into its secret hiding.

45
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,360
Now it feels like the incognito
exile has begun.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,520
It will be very difficult for us
to remain in hiding

47
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,880
if all of us are together.

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
The news of our incognito exile
must have definitely reached

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,840
every corner
of the Arya empire.

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,960
Everyone must be
looking for a family

51
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,840
with five men
and a woman.

52
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,080
Hence

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
we cannot stay
together.

54
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,600
We will have a new identity
for the next one year

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,160
and we will have to always
keep this new identity in mind.

56
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,760
But, brother, if someone
asks you who you are

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,760
then what will your
answer be?

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
I cannot lie, Bhima.

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,360
If someone asks me who I am
I will remain quiet.

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,160
Your remaining quit is not
sufficient, brother.

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,320
Your being quiet
can reveal our truth.

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
Can't you lie for just
a year, brother?

63
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,760
Not even for a moment,
Nakul.

64
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,960
Whether lightning strikes
a tree once or continuously

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
there's no difference.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
The tree gets burnt
the first time.

67
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,480
Lie spoken once
harms the soul.

68
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
I cannot be defeated
by someone's conspiracy

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,800
and break my vow.
- But, brother

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,280
if we're caught again
then we'll be exiled again.

71
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
Another incognito exile.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,440
This tradition will see no end.
- I know that.

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,360
That's the whole idea
behind incognito exile.

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
But, Sahadeva

75
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,640
if I had to use lies
to be victorious

76
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
then why would we
have to be exiled?

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,800
Brother Arjun, show us
the way.

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,200
Parth*
Arjun other name, Paartha "son of Pritha (Kunti)."

79
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,520
many couples have secretive
names for each other.

80
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,240
Even I give you
a name today.

81
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,480
Here after your name is Mantri Kank.*
*Sage Gold.

82
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
And until someone specifically
asks you

83
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,360
if you have another name
beyond Kank

84
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,920
you will introduce yourself
as Kank to everyone.

85
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,160
And when someone
does question you

86
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,000
you will remain quiet.
You can do this, right?

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

88
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,280
If Draupadi has given a name
to her husband

89
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
then that will definitely
be my identity.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
In the same manner, I will
give all of you a name

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,240
and for the coming year

92
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,200
that name will be your
only identity.

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,880
No, Draupadi, don't
give me a name.

94
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,120
Madhav has already
given me a name.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
What name has he given you?

96
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,440
Brihn! It sounded something
like that, isn't it, Nakul?

97
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,560
I don't remember, brother.
But Vasudeva said

98
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,320
that brother Arjun looks
beautiful with that name.

99
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,160
Why?
What so special about that name?

100
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,920
There's a speciality,
Draupadi.

101
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,440
Now, you will have
to hide your clothes

102
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
or else he will
steal them.

103
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,160
Lord Agni, this bow was given
by you as a sacrament.

104
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,880
We're leaving our weapons
in your protection.

105
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,680
After one year

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,800
we will come back
to get our weapons

107
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,680
and we will attack
the Kauravas

108
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
to destroy them.

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
Bless us.

110
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,040
'Chaitra.'*
*The first month of the year in Hindu calendar.

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,280
Your Highness, Pandavas
are not there at Dwarka.

112
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,240
We went to Panchal.
But they weren't there, either.

113
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Where are the Pandavas?
- Our messengers have sent

114
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,440
a message from Naaglok* and Kuntibhoj, brother.
*Naga Loka: Naga/serpent Kingdom (Bheem's drowning location).

115
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,480
Pandavas are not there either.

116
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,960
Pandavas!

117
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,920
Uncle

118
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,800
even the last spy
has returned.

119
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,920
The Pandavas are not there
in any of our

120
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,800
neighbouring kingdoms

121
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,360
that is for sure.

122
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
Dwarka

123
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,400
Panchal

124
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,960
Kashi

125
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,960
Naaglok

126
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,680
Madra, Kuntibhoj

127
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,680
every place where
the Pandavas have their family

128
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
they haven't gone
even there, uncle.

129
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Where do we look for them?
In heaven!

130
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,440
My child, if they
were in Heaven

131
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,640
then why would we
look for them?

132
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,880
They are hiding

133
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,480
in one of these states

134
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
within the boundaries
Arya dynasty.

135
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
But where, uncle?

136
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,760
There's only one month left
for the completion

137
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
of the incognito exile.

138
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,480
Just 30 days!

139
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,600
I cannot find any other place

140
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,920
where we should look
for them uncle.

141
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,240
No place!

142
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
Think properly,
King of Gandhar.

143
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,480
Shakuni!

144
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,520
You are very proud

145
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
of your wisdom.

146
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,040
Vasudeva Krishna!

147
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,320
What could he have
thought of

148
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,400
that I have failed
to understand?

149
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,260
What are the things

150
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,460
that a human requires
so he can hide?

151
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,260
New attire

152
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,300
new name

153
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,100
new city

154
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,780
and a new occupation.
- Not occupation, my child.

155
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,060
Not occupation.

156
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,700
One cannot change
his occupation

157
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,620
very easily.

158
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,780
He can only indulge
in the occupation

159
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,660
that he has practise of.

160
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,540
But, uncle

161
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,740
warriors like
Arjun and Bhima...

162
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,620
If they were a part
of any army

163
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,380
then they wouldn't be
able to hide.

164
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,860
Not war!

165
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,620
What are their
other skills?

166
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,060
Nakul

167
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,940
he is the most knowledgeable
when it comes to horse riding.

168
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,140
Think, my child.
Think!

169
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,340
For the last one year

170
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,420
which kingdom's horses

171
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,260
have become the most famous?

172
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,900
Sahadeva.

173
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,620
A cow is the happiest

174
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,020
in Sahadeva's presence.

175
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,980
Think, my child.

176
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,500
Which kingdom's cows

177
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,580
have become famous
in the last one year?

178
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,540
And, Yudhisthira

179
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,020
is a scholar at monarchy.

180
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,100
Find out, my child

181
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,260
which king in the last
one year

182
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,340
has signed a treaty
with other kingdoms?

183
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,940
Think, my child.
Think!

184
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,140
I have heard

185
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,980
that the king of Virat
has signed a treaty

186
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,500
with many kingdoms
of the south.

187
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,740
His kingdom

188
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,020
has been prosperous.

189
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,500
The king has begun
work on making

190
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,220
100 new reservoirs.

191
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,860
Aroma,
odour

192
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,500
and human behaviour

193
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,620
cannot be hidden.

194
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,060
Our spies may have failed

195
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
to find them

196
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,700
but, my child

197
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,740
Pandavas

198
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,980
are definitely
in Virat.

199
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,220
In Virat!

200
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,100
Virat.

201
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,180
- Cook Vallabh. - Cook Vallabh.*
*"Beloved."

202
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,180
Please give us a 'ladoo'.

203
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
If you have so many 'ladoos'

204
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,540
then you'll become fat
like Bhima.

205
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,020
Am I fat?
- He isn't referring to you.

206
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,500
He's referring to Hastinapur's
Prince Bhima.

207
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,060
But he doesn't know
that Bhima

208
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,740
is the most powerful
in the world.

209
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,220
'Ladoos' give energy
to Bhima.

210
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,980
I want to become
the best archer in the world

211
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,460
just like Arjun.
- What's so great about archery?

212
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,740
Become strong.
Gain strength.

213
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,220
Here, child

214
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,100
have 'ladoos' prepared
by cook Vallabh.

215
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,180
You will gain strength
and become powerful.

216
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,140
Have one more.
Have them.

217
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,140
Cook, I want one too.

218
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
You!
Run away from here.

219
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,060
You want to be an archer!

220
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,780
Run!

221
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,100
Listen, child

222
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,180
take these two 'ladoos' for Tantripal.*
*"Guardian of the calves."

223
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,500
Who's Tantripal?
- There's a man

224
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,020
who is sitting
with the cows.

225
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
I'm scared that if he doesn't
get these 'ladoos'

226
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,980
he will start feeding on grass.
Here.

227
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
Go, child.
Go.

228
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,100
Tantripal...

229
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,900
Tantripal.

230
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,500
Cook 'ladoo' has sent
Vallabh for you.

231
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,660
I mean

232
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,420
cook Vallabh has sent
'ladoo' for you.

233
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,820
He himself loves 'ladoo'
since childhood.

234
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,020
What? You know him
since childhood?

235
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,500
Don't even ask, child.

236
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,500
Cook Vallabh once gave me a pat
on my back.

237
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,980
Look at what it has
become.

238
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,660
'Ladoo'!

239
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
These 'ladoos' are delicious.

240
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,500
Child, do one thing.

241
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,140
There's a person
at the stable.

242
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,260
His name is Granthika.*
*"Astrologer, narrator."

243
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,140
Go and give this 'ladoo'
to him.

244
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Take it.

245
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,380
Hurry up.
Go.
