1
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,320
Stop!

2
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,190
Enemies are not premitted
to go near his Excellency!

3
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,290
Go and tell grandsire

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,330
that his grandsons

5
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,230
wish to meet him.

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,330
We have no weapons on us.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,330
Go

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,140
and seek his permision.

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,210
His Excellency,
the sons of Pandu are here.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,250
They have no weapons on them

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,260
and they seek your permission to meet you.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,180
No,

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,260
they do not have my permission.

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,260
If they meet me today

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,260
then tomorrow in the battlefield

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,330
they will not be able to strike at me.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,240
Go and tell the sons of Pandu

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,310
that His Excellency Bhishma
cannot meet the enemies.

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,320
Stop!

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,320
Go and tell them

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,120
that they do have my
permission to meet me.

22
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,220
Grandsire,
all of us...

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,350
Before you say anything,
you must listen to me.

24
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,290
As long as I am alive

25
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,360
I have no intention of
forsaking my duties.

26
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,230
In other words

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,110
neither will I
give up my weapons

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,220
nor give up protecting
the sons of Dhristarashtra

29
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,260
It is the duty of all of you
that you must

30
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,300
battle with all your might.

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,230
If you need

32
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,310
to make a sacrifice

33
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,300
then you must do so gladly

34
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,280
and obtain victory.

35
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,150
In other words

36
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,330
slaying me is your duty.

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,070
If...

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,230
If any of you

39
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,140
forsakes this duty

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,210
then

41
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,220
it will break my heart.

42
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,090
My death

43
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,250
will become excruciatingly agonizing.

44
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,100
Even after listening to all this

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,130
if you still have a question

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,330
then go ahead and ask.

47
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,310
- But, grandsire...
- I know, dear.

48
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,180
The very thought of my death

49
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,350
makes your heart shudder.

50
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,230
However

51
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,360
it is a moment of good fortune for me

52
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,140
because the journey of a very
long and unsuccessful life

53
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,240
is drawing to an end.

54
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,270
In my life

55
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,280
I have seen nothing but misery

56
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
and now

57
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,190
it is time for my miseries to end.

58
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,070
And

59
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,210
I can have

60
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,180
that good fortune from
all of you.

61
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,210
Until now

62
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,350
you have obeyed all my orders.

63
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,190
Today

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,290
you must obey one last order

65
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,260
of your grandsire.

66
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,210
While slaying me

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,140
even if your heart shudders

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,310
your hands must not tremble!

69
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,310
[MUSIC]

70
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,130
I have only one question
for you, grandsire.

71
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,270
You are illuminating to us
the path to have the kingdom.

72
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,110
But who will dispense sound advice to us

73
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,080
to govern it?

74
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,250
Grandsire.

75
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,190
It was your oath.

76
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,160
That until you help
the throne of Hastinapur

77
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,190
get a king who is both
righteous and competent

78
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,330
you will not leave this world.

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,280
With this oath as our basis.

80
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,340
Did we begin this war.

81
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,220
However, after our victory.

82
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,210
If you are not there,

83
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,090
then who will test us?

84
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,150
Who will test us, grandsire?

85
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,360
Grandsire.

86
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,340
Until a judge gives the permission.

87
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,100
No deed can truly be called just.

88
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,240
When the son of Dhritarashtra get slain 
by me over here.

89
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,250
Who will assure us
that this is not murder.

90
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,120
But justice?

91
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,250
If you leave, then this battlefield

92
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,350
will be robbed of rightnousness
forever, grandsire.

93
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,070
Forever...

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,340
All of you are correct.

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,270
A few of my duties have
not been fulfilled yet.

96
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,250
I give you my word.

97
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,120
That before I leave this world.

98
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,190
I shall discharge all my duties.

99
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,130
You must expunge yourselves
of all your suspicions.

100
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,330
And discharge your duties.

101
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,210
Now, this judge shall
award himself a punisment!

102
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
He allowed the wife of his grandsons,

103
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,290
and his daughter-in-law

104
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,050
to be humilliated before everyone.

105
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,260
Hence the son of Shantanu.

106
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,100
Devavrat Bhishma is awarded death!

107
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,080
Before sundown tomorrow,

108
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,210
this punishment shall be imposed!

109
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,100
Now, all of you...

110
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,270
All of you should leave.

111
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:56,190
[MUSIC]

112
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,330
May you live long!

113
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,200
May you be victorious!

114
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,080
Draupadi.

115
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,160
Dear, could you wait for a while?

116
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,850
You may remember this, dear.

117
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,920
You had said during the game of dice...

118
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,720
"Duryodhan will indeed be punished for his sins."

119
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,890
"But before that every person
present in this court"

120
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,900
"will be punished for his silence."

121
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,840
"This is the curse of Yajnaseni Draupadi!"

122
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,910
That curse of yours

123
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,680
is about to yield its results now.

124
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,930
I...

125
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,900
Accept this punishment
of yours, dear.

126
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,740
A culprit...

127
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,710
attains liberation
only after being pardoned.

128
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,840
Will you...

129
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,880
be able to pardon this culprit of yours, dear?

130
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,770
No, Grandsire.

131
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,730
Please do not plead with me.

132
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,740
Dear...

133
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,670
Determining man's age...

134
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,770
in terms of years
is not correct.

135
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,680
His age...

136
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,720
is determined by the number
of sacrifices he makes.

137
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,940
You...

138
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,880
For this dynasty of mine, you...

139
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,860
have made way more sacrifices than me.

140
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,760
You truly are worthy of reverence, dear.

141
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,800
Will you...

142
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,670
be able to pardon me and
grant me liberation, dear?

143
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,850
Your highness.

144
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,820
Is it true?

145
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:36,770
Will Shikandini, the daughter of Drupad
enter the battlefield tommorow as a man?

146
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,830
She will enter not only as a man but
also as uncle's doom, Vidur!

147
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,740
She will enter not only as uncle's doom...
But also as that of my sons!

148
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,690
N-No...

149
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,730
T-That cannot be.

150
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,830
My sons cannot die.

151
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,870
M-My sons cannot die, Vidur.

152
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,680
Vidur!

153
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Do something, Vidur.

154
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,950
Send a message.

155
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:34,690
Do something but under any circumstance, 
we must stop uncle from entering the battlefield.

156
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,730
We must stop him, Vidur.

157
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,790
In his safety lies
t-that of my sons, Vidur.

158
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,780
Go and send a message at once to
the battlefield, Vidur.

159
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,840
Send a message, that is my order...

160
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,670
That uncle is barred from
entering the battlefield!

161
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
That's impossible, your highness.

162
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,760
It is too late to send a message now.

163
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,740
The sun is about to rise, Your highness.

164
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,650
In just a few moments,

165
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,680
the war will begin.

166
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,270
Your excellency

167
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,110
allow me to be of service to you

168
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,150
for one last time.

169
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,250
You are a guru

170
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,090
and a guru
ought not serve others, Guru Drona.

171
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,190
A guru is one who does not
get bound to any tie in life.

172
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,090
The day I coveted the kingdom

173
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,110
I ceased to be a guru.

174
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,270
I merely become

175
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,040
a teacher who educates people.

176
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,220
Your excellency

177
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,180
I am not worthy of reverence.

178
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,010
In this battlefield

179
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,990
you shall attain liberation.

180
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Similarly

181
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,230
after a while

182
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,170
I shall attain liberation too.

183
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,010
That day
it is possible

184
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,980
for me to regain
the title of a guru.

185
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,210
Today,
I am only a teacher.

186
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,220
Only a teacher.

187
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,030
So allow me to be
of service to you today.

188
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,230
Your excellency.

189
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,210
This is an honor to me.

190
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,210
So, do not keep it from me.

191
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,200
Goodbye!

192
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
I shall meet you again
in heaven, guru Drona.

193
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,130
May you be victorious sister!

194
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,970
May the Almighty helps you

195
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,010
get the revenge today that
you have seeked

196
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,940
in all your births.

197
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,080
May your heart
finally attains peace.
