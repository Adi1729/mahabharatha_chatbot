1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,230
In reality a human isn't
bound by his deeds.

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,170
The expectations linked to
those deeds bind him.

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,260
How so, Krishna?

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,790
If you hope to be victorious
in this war

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,730
then you shall feel
immense sorrow upon defeat.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,720
And that sorrow shall compel you
to do something else

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,330
for which you need to
be born again.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
If you are victorious

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,790
your arrogance shall grow.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,390
And that arrogance

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,560
shall drive you towards
worldly triumph.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,650
It shall make you kill

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,660
and the sin ought to it
shall bind you.

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,060
Think about it!

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,260
If in this battle
you have no desire to win

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,460
and have no fear of losing

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,000
would you feel bliss or sorrow
at the end of this war?

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,130
Neither bliss, Krishna

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,320
nor sorrow.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,130
Therefore your bliss, sorrow

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,590
hopelessness, disappointment,
arrogance

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,750
aren't due to the war.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,290
The expectations that you have
from the war

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,390
shall cause them.

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,620
Is it not true, Arjun?

26
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,360
Therefore, holding joys
and sorrows as equals

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,930
without thinking of
gain, loss, victory or defeat

28
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,360
if you engage in battle,
O' son of Kunti

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,130
you shall not bear any sins.

30
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,560
This is called 'Karma Yoga'.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,230
The one who attains
the knowledge of 'Saankhya'

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,590
realises the fact
that he isn't a body

33
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,320
but a mere soul.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,230
That the bliss and experiences of
the body are only until death.

35
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,560
And therefore, aren't real,
but just illusions.

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,360
For him becoming a 'Karma Yogi'
becomes easier.

37
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,560
But, Krishna

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,620
if deeds are meant to restrain

39
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,630
isn't it wise to renounce
the world

40
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,060
and embrace sainthood?

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Such thinking is the sole reason
for this war today, Arjun!

42
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,460
Ponder over it.

43
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,360
When the ones possessing 'Gunas'

44
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,660
and the ones who know justice
give up deeds

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,630
then the ones full of injustice

46
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,520
run the world.

47
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,460
Had Grandsire Bhishma
not renounced the world

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,160
injustice wouldn't have
grown so vast today.

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,890
And had your father
not gone on an exile

50
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,800
brother Yudishtir would be
reigning in peace today

51
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,790
and would be teaching
his subjects

52
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,890
about justice and righteousness.

53
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,420
But Arjun, the sad truth is

54
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,890
that only the virtuous ones
can benefit the world.

55
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,030
But they are the ones
who often think of sainthood.

56
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,520
Just as water drifts away
as steam

57
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,130
and did keeps lying
right there, similarly

58
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,370
the virtuous and learned ones
give up the world

59
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,030
and unjust ones possessed by
'Tamas' function in the world.

60
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,420
Ought to this very reason sins
and injustice grow in the world.

61
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,960
But 'Karma Yoga'
protects this world

62
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,030
from this bizarre situation!

63
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,890
A 'karma Yogi' gives up
expectations of an outcome

64
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,000
but not the deeds themselves.

65
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,490
He stays in this very world

66
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,160
like a saint.

67
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,090
He performs all actions

68
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,360
but doesn't lose himself in one.

69
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,520
A 'Karma Yogi' expects nothing

70
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,390
from his children,
from his dear ones

71
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,490
and even his subjects at all.

72
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,200
He himself reaps the benefits
of sainthood.

73
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,160
But he benefits the world
like a familial head.

74
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,100
A human toils for the well being
of his off-springs.

75
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,430
How can he not expect joy
from his own off-springs?

76
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,490
Whatever a human does
for his children

77
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,200
is it a transaction
or an act of love?

78
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,130
Love, Krishna.

79
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,430
Then why expect an outcome
for his deeds, Arjun?

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,730
Future gains are measured
in a transaction

81
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,460
and not in love.

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,090
The human who moulds
his children's character well

83
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,060
and bestows the virtues of
love and justice upon them

84
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,130
his children shall surely give
him love and protection.

85
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,390
The deeds of one's children

86
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,160
and the behaviour of dear ones
reflect one's own deeds, Arjun.

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,720
And when one has no rights
upon their deeds

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,890
what is the use of having hopes
and expectations from them?

89
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,030
If you think deeply, Arjun,
you shall realise soon

90
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,660
that there is no deed in life

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,830
to which linking hopes
and expectations is inevitable.

92
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,390
When the creation is God

93
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,360
and human is a fragment of God

94
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,890
all actions are caused
by God himself.

95
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,990
A human does nothing on his own.

96
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,290
This is the base principle
of 'Karma Yoga', Arjun.

97
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,130
Hence it is necessary

98
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,860
that you become a 'Karma Yogi'
and fight this battle, Arjun.

99
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,030
By giving up three 'Gunas'
be free of them, Arjun.

100
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,830
Be free of this dilemma!

101
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,890
Always think for 'Sattva'
which is the Lord himself

102
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,720
and continue with your duties.

103
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,530
The desire to achieve something

104
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,230
and the thought of defending
something that was achieved

105
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,590
must be given up, Arjun
and liberate your soul.

106
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,520
Remember, Arjun.

107
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,890
Your right is only
to commit deeds.

108
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,530
The outcome relies on the Lord.

109
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,260
Therefore neither is it right
to run from deeds

110
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,060
nor is it right to expect
a return for your deeds.

111
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,000
The one who gives up
on outcomes

112
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,460
but does not give up deeds

113
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,160
how can such a 'Karma Yogi'
be recognised, Krishna?

114
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,260
Look, Arjun?

115
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,930
The one who gives up food
just to escape its taste

116
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,890
in reality the craving for taste
never leaves his mind.

117
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,190
He faces a twofold loss.

118
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
For one he becomes weak

119
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,160
due to which the inevitable
effort of attaining the Lord

120
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,030
cannot be done by him.

121
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,690
And secondly

122
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,830
his mind is always full
of craving for taste.

123
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,230
Hence rather than giving up food

124
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,660
one better gives up
the craving for taste itself.

125
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,800
A 'Karma Yogi' draws out
all cravings in his mind.

126
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,160
He accepts life as his duty
and does function.

127
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,930
But he is never in harmony
with his actions.

128
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,600
And Arjun

129
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,760
the one who has no hopes and
expectations from his actions

130
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,570
are the one whose motives
are fulfilled.

131
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,500
The one whose mind doesn't
falter even after one failure

132
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,160
The one who doesn't think he is
most superior after one success

133
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,260
such a person is called
a 'Karma Yogi'.

134
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,700
And such a person succeeds
in life repeatedly.

135
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,730
Wishes arise out of expectations
of outcome.

136
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,960
And it is a characteristic of
wishes to stay unfulfilled.

137
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,670
Unfulfilment gives rise
to anger.

138
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,100
And anger gives rise to desire.

139
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,560
Due to desire a person

140
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,630
forgets the knowledge
of behaviour and interaction.

141
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,200
Loss of knowledge causes
loss of virtue.

142
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,670
Inappropriate actions
take place.

143
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,500
And the society becomes
an enemy of such a person.

144
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,960
And in the end such a person
meets complete downfall.

145
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,020
Like for brother Duryodhan

146
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,560
his Commander-in-chief
Grandsire

147
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,630
is his enemy

148
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,970
and he blessed you
to emerge victorious.

149
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,720
Arjun

150
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,930
dutifulness is the second step
towards the divine knowledge.

151
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,960
Strengthen your faith
in the Almighty.

152
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,360
Know your own self.

153
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,430
Break free from the shackles
of bondage.

154
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,630
Sacrifice the desire of the
outcome and do only your duty.

155
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,510
By strengthening my faith
in the Almighty

156
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,980
how can I become dutiful?

157
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,340
Arjun, due to 'Sankhya Yoga'

158
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,310
a human keeps reminiscing
the Almighty.

159
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,230
Reminiscing the Almighty

160
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,070
gives birth to a sense
of submission.

161
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,440
And this sense is called
devotion.

162
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,100
Devotion enlightens a human
about what is right and wrong.

163
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,010
And that knowledge gives him
a glimpse of the Almighty.

164
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,470
The one who gets a glimpse
of the Almighty

165
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,280
he becomes the most Dutiful.

166
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,970
He is freed from the circle of
rebirth and attains salvation.

167
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,840
That is the ultimate aim
of all souls

168
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,740
and the pinnacle
of righteousness.

169
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,740
But how will I submit

170
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,040
without a glimpse
of the Almighty, Madhav?

171
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,370
To get a glimpse of the Almighty

172
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,710
get rid of

173
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,900
greed, pride, anger

174
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,310
and prejudice.

175
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,000
If a person sitting in
a dark room says

176
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
that he wants to see the Sun
what will you suggest him?

177
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,170
Won't you tell him to come out
of the room

178
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,110
and stand under an open sky?

179
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Sun is already present there!

180
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,700
Similarly, Arjun, this universe
is the Almighty.

181
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,710
The Almighty is everything.

182
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,370
Nothing else other from Him.

183
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,240
The one who sees his soul

184
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,940
sees the Almighty.

185
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,370
Like the taste of
a single granule of salt

186
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,170
is indifferent from
the taste of the ocean

187
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,370
similarly

188
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,000
a soul is indifferent

189
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,910
from the Supreme Soul.

190
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,740
That means, Madhav

191
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,240
are you the Almighty?

192
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,940
Yes, Arjun.
I am the Almighty.

193
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,730
Just like you are.

194
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,640
But you aren't enlightened
about it

195
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,740
unlike me.

196
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,070
So, Madhav

197
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,540
why isn't submission before you
regarded submission before God?

198
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,010
Absolutely.

199
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,510
Submission before me is
submission before the Almighty.

200
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,000
Sacrifice everything
and seek my refuge, Arjun.

201
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,900
I am the universe.

202
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,780
I am present in every aspect
of the universe.

203
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,100
I am the Sun and I am the moon.

204
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,740
I am present in all the
constellations and planets.

205
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,670
I am more ancient than the Sun

206
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,970
and as new as
a blossoming flower.

207
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,000
I am the human race.

208
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,440
I am the power that creates
heaven and hell.

209
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,130
I am Duryodhan.

210
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,870
And I am Arjun too.

211
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,990
How is that possible, Madhav?

212
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,090
People have witnessed
your birth.

213
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,890
Your mother is still alive.
You took birth from her womb.

214
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,650
How can you be, both,
ancient and modern?

215
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,720
You are seeing the body

216
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,030
and I talk of the soul.

217
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,620
I have been born innumerable
times, Arjun.

218
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,960
I have many avatars.

219
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,060
I have taken up many forms
and have died right here!

220
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,790
And I will take many births
in the future, as well.

221
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,820
Whenever righteousness is harmed

222
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,560
whenever the
evil raises its hood

223
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,560
in order to rescue the righteous

224
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,860
to annihilate the evil

225
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,430
and to re-establish
righteousness, I'll take birth.

226
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,030
This has happened in every age

227
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,460
and will continue to happen
in future, as well.

228
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,690
I am the Almighty!

229
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,460
I was the Matsya avatar*
*The fish that kills Damanaka to save the vedas and also saves Manu from a great flood that submerges the entire Earth.

230
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,660
and the Vamana avatar.*
*The dwarf that grows into a giant to save the world from King Bali.

231
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,060
I am Parashurama and
I was Lord Rama!

232
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,930
I am Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (Shiva)!

233
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,160
And I am Saraswati, Kali
and Lakshmi, as well.

234
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,830
I am neither male nor female

235
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,020
nor a transgender.

236
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,390
I am neither the body
nor its parts.

237
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,450
I am knowledge, creation

238
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,730
reason and eternal.

239
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,090
I am everything!

240
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,950
Yet, I am nothing!

241
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,630
This has happened in every age

242
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,490
and will happen in future,
as well.
