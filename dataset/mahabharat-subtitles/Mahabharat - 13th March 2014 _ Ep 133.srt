1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,440
I can see that my friend
too, is very angry.

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Greetings, Madhav.

3
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,560
Only one with a right
to have a temper can be angry.

4
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,500
I bear no such rights
over you

5
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,700
other than friendship.

6
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,600
I am not the throne, Arjun

7
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,440
whose authority can
be passed on.

8
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,460
My name is Vasudev Krishna.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,600
He who claims his rights
on me

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,500
I willingly give him
the rights.

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,490
Subhadra's wedding
with Duryodhan...

12
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,630
What's the purpose
of this, Madhav?

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,370
His Highness Shakuni
said

14
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,430
that the Kuru
and Yadav clans

15
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
need to have an alliance
born of kinship.

16
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,570
How could I oppose
such a noble thought?

17
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,330
It's a conspiracy.

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,600
A conspiracy to stop
the Rajsuya Yajna

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,500
from taking place
at Indraprastha.

20
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,470
Madhav

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,440
it's a tradition.

22
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,340
The royal family
with which an alliance is forged

23
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,430
but isn't bonded together
by kinship

24
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,270
has to be defeated.

25
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,440
That's when the Rajsuya Yajna
can take place.

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
And we will never come
to defeat Dwarka.

27
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,500
Parth*
*Paartha, "son of Pritha", another name for Kunti.

28
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,270
my purpose wasn't to
break ties with Indraprastha

29
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,470
by getting Subhadra married.

30
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,370
During the Rajsuya Yajna

31
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,340
if Duryodhan attacks
Indraprastha

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,330
then you'll have to be
on their side, Madhav.

33
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,340
And we...

34
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,270
We'll have to surrender our
weapons in front of you

35
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,290
Madhav.

36
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,470
You analysed everything
politically, Arjun.

37
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
But about
my dear sister Subhadra

38
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
you never gave a thought.

39
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,340
I did think of her, Madhav.

40
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,230
You know how unrighteous
Duryodhan is.

41
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,300
How will Subhadra spend
her life with him?

42
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,430
What bliss will she get
at Hastinapur?

43
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,270
You needn't worry
about me.

44
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,170
I will be happy
wherever I go.

45
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,270
No.

46
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,300
Because of me,
my sister eyes

47
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,270
are filled with tears.

48
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,260
Now you will have to defend
me from this problem, Parth.

49
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,170
Me?
- Yes, Parth.

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,340
That's the reason
I had told you

51
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,240
that your penance

52
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,310
will be completed
at Somnath.

53
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,330
Brother.

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Tell me.

55
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,360
Will you guard me?

56
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,200
Saw that, Prince Arjun

57
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,330
I had told you, that whatever
my brother does

58
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,300
has more than
one interpretation.

59
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,270
But, Madhav, I cannot
marry Subhadra.

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
It's impossible.

61
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,330
Vikarna

62
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,140
where are uncle
and Dushashan?

63
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,130
I don't know, brother.

64
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I saw them leave
by a chariot.

65
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,300
She has been pledged

66
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,070
to Duryodhan.

67
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,240
So what?

68
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,300
Rukmini too was pledged
to Sishupal.

69
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,300
But Draupadi too was
in this state.

70
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
And there were only
two choices then.

71
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,310
Either you brothers would've
fought each other

72
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,200
or any four of you would've
renounced the world.

73
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,110
But Draupadi made way
for the third option.

74
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,060
My friend has done
a lot of favours

75
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,230
for you five brothers.

76
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,130
But here

77
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,100
the circumstances
are different.

78
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
And I didn't know that
you were hesitant

79
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,230
to take up arms
against Duryodhan.

80
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,130
Or is the thought of
Duryodhan renouncing the world

81
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,970
breaking your heart?

82
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,160
Call the bride to
the wedding podium.

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,230
Go and get Subhadra.

84
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,190
If I abduct Subhadra

85
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,100
then you and brother Balram

86
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,070
will have to fight me.

87
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,130
And I cannot take up arms
against you.

88
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,040
That's true, Parth.

89
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,060
A battle will be announced.

90
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a very dreadful
situation.

91
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,090
Subhadra

92
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,970
Parth cannot abduct you.

93
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,130
But, brother, I can
abduct your friend.

94
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,140
Abduct me!

95
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,970
How can you abduct me?

96
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,870
A warrior abducted
by a girl...

97
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,970
This has never happened before.

98
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,060
But, the solution is
an excellent one, Parth.

99
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,000
There's a problem though.

100
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,990
You'll be mocked at.

101
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,060
You will be humiliated.

102
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,970
Give it a thought.

103
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,940
What is your command?

104
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,970
In this world, it is valour that
always abducts love

105
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,960
but I believe

106
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,840
that if love abducts valour

107
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,000
then the world can be
a happier place.

108
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,940
But the final decision
is yours, Parth.

109
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,930
At your behest I had taken up
a woman's guise.

110
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,960
Let me do this too.

111
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
Subhadra

112
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,000
you know driving a chariot.

113
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,030
I have kept
the chariot

114
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,960
ready for you.

115
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,800
Brother.

116
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Stay blessed.

117
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,800
Go, Parth.

118
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,770
If the future of the entire

119
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,000
Aryan lineage didn't depend
on this abduction

120
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,770
then I wouldn't have gone
through with this fabrication.

121
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,850
Balram

122
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,980
why is the bride taking
so long to arrive?

123
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,820
I'll send the maids,
Your Highness.

124
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,920
Hurry up, charioteer.

125
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,920
That is Princess Subhadra,
uncle!

126
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,780
Where is she going
with a sage

127
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,950
at this time?

128
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,960
That was Arjun, you fool!

129
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,850
Vasudev Krishna!

130
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,660
You will have to face
the consequences

131
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,750
of this fabrication, Vasudev.

132
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,810
We will have to get
to Dwarka soon.

133
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,850
Prince Balram, it is time
for the wedding ritual.

134
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,790
Get Princess Subhadra to
the wedding podium.

135
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,910
Balram, what's taking long?

136
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,850
Why the delay?

137
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,790
How can she come,
Your Highness?

138
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,690
Because she is far
away from Dwarka.

139
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,880
And unfortunately,
her chariot is running

140
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,710
in the direction
opposite to Dwarka.

141
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
King Shakuni!

142
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,750
What are you
trying to say?

143
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,810
Dushashan and I
have seen it ourselves

144
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,810
Prince Balram.

145
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,720
At first, I thought that
the chariot wasn't in control.

146
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,590
But now, Prince Balram,
the question is

147
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,780
if the chariot wasn't in control

148
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,610
or is Princess Subhadra

149
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,750
not in control?

150
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,720
You're forgetting your limits,
King Shakuni.

151
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,810
Um...

152
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,780
And your sister has forgotten

153
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,710
about the honour of Hastinapur.

154
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,810
Keeping the prince of Hastinapur
waiting at the wedding podium

155
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,750
she has renounced Dwarka

156
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,690
and eloped with
someone else.

157
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
But why will Subhadra
do such a thing?

158
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,650
Good question.

159
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,750
But you can get the answer
from your younger brother

160
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,750
Vasudev Krishna.

161
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,850
Rudra Yadav, go and see
where Krishna is.

162
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm right here, brother.

163
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,710
Ask him, Prince Balram.
Ask him!

164
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,550
Vasudev

165
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,720
at this time,
is Princess Subhadra

166
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,710
in Dwarka?

167
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,520
No, brother.

168
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,520
I have to admit
with great regret

169
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,790
that Subhadra is not in Dwarka
right now.

170
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,610
She isn't in Dwarka!

171
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
What do you mean?

172
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,650
Where is she?
When will she return?

173
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,450
Forgive me, Your Highness.

174
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,680
It's a very disgraceful
thing for Dwarka.

175
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,560
I supplicate
and apologise to you

176
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,550
but my sister Subhadra

177
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,720
will now return with her husband
only after her marriage.

178
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,550
She will return after
her marriage!

179
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,610
What are you trying
to attempt, Prince Balram?

180
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,720
To defeat Subhadra's
abductor

181
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,690
and get Subhadra to
the wedding podium

182
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,450
is your responsibility.

183
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,650
You're right, Prince Duryodhan.

184
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,690
Krishna

185
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,420
why isn't the army ready
to attack yet?

186
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,480
I'll get the army ready
right away, brother

187
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,420
but there's a problem.

188
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,450
Who will we fight?

189
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,420
The one who abducted
is without arms

190
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,440
and is a woman.

191
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
The warrior who is armed

192
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,420
is the one who
is abducted.

193
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,680
It's a very dreadful situation.

194
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,550
Who has abducted whom?

195
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,620
Reveal this to everyone here

196
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,390
so that everyone is able
to understand

197
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,520
your conspiracy

198
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,350
Vasudev.
- King Shakuni

199
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,610
conspiracy means six kinds
of fabrications.

200
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,490
I have committed only
one fabrication, brother.

201
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,490
I lent my chariot
to my dear sister

202
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,360
so that she could abduct
her husband.

203
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,460
And do you know who she
has chosen as her husband

204
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,510
Your Highness?

205
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,320
Son of Pandu Arjun!

206
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,700
And do you know who she
has chosen as her husband

207
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,460
Your Highness?

208
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,570
Son of Pandu Arjun!

209
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Krishna

210
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,660
because of your plays

211
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,530
I'll have to hide myself
in the womb of the Earth.

212
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,530
Brother, that's certain.

213
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,490
And the place too
is certain.

214
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,430
Prince Balram

215
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,500
the princess had been pledged.

216
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,400
You had given your word

217
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,660
that Duryodhan
and Princess Subhadra's wedding

218
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,590
will be conducted by you.

219
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,660
In a certain sense,
she had been married

220
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,560
then how can she get married
for the second time?

221
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,530
Forgive me, Your Excellency.

222
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,470
If pledging means marriage

223
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,590
then what is the need
for the seven vows?

224
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,590
Pledging means,
the approval of the parents

225
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,490
but a marriage is complete
only after the approval

226
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,590
of the man and the woman.

227
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,470
Pledging cannot be considered
marriage, Your Excellency.

228
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,630
If that's the case

229
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,490
then what is the significance
of giving away the daughter

230
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,590
Vasudev?

231
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,330
The fruit of coconut
falls in the sea

232
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,630
and then the tree renounces its
right on that fruit.

233
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,500
Which bank it will go to
and which land it chooses

234
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,570
to grow as a new tree,
is decided by the fruit

235
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,470
and its fate.

236
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,400
During the giving away ceremony
the parents

237
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,530
renounce their rights
on their daughter.

238
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,460
But who she wants to give
the rights on her

239
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,340
is decided by the girl.

240
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,560
My dear sister Subhadra
also took this decision

241
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,340
and I accepted her decision
on behalf of the Yadavs.

242
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,400
Now you shall only have enmity
with Hastinapur, Vasudev.

243
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,530
Very soon, Hastinapur's army
will attack Dwarka.

244
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,290
Attack!
