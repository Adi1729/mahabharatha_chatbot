1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,180
These five Brahmans are
none other than

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,180
the princes of Hastinapur

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,360
the sons of Emperor Pandu.

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,220
And he's Arjun.

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,350
The one you dreamt of getting
Draupadi married to.

6
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,380
They are the Pandavas?

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,380
Disguised as Brahmans?

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,250
Impossible!

9
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,220
That's impossible!
- Your Highness

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,150
I assure you

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,110
welcoming them is your duty.

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,090
This is how I welcome them.

13
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,060
If they really are the Pandavas

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,250
they should be punished
for sure, Vasudev!

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,090
I'm sure these princes
of Hastinapur

16
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,120
hadn't come to Panchal
to get married.

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,220
They had come with a plan

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,050
to humiliate Panchal.

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,190
My daughter put the garland
around Arjun's neck

20
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,020
in full faith.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,120
And in exchange he gave
Draupadi a reason

22
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,020
to shed tears all her life.

23
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,090
I believed, Vasudev

24
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,060
that they understand the
meaning of righteousness

25
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,150
and this is what they did.

26
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,120
God has made them do this,
King Drupad.

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,280
It's doesn't matter whether or
not they are innocent.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,190
Because of them my daughter's
life has become miserable.

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,990
Whether she marries all five
of them or remains unmarried

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,220
she will face humiliation
all her life.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,980
Because of them, Vasudev.

32
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,050
All because of them!

33
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,220
Not because of them,
Your Highness.

34
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,990
Because of you.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,990
What future had you wanted
for Draupadi when she was born?

36
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,050
Try to recollect, Your Highness.

37
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,110
'I ask that my daughter suffer

38
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,020
all her life.'

39
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,060
'May she be bestowed with
all the impurities of the world'

40
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,090
'but still be considered pure.'

41
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,150
'Can you give me such
a daughter?'

42
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,190
'May that girl endure injustice
time and again.'

43
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,880
The consequences of the
deeds of parents

44
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,910
has to be borne by
their children.

45
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,950
Now, Draupadi too will get
all the sorrow

46
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
you had asked for her.

47
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,050
As you sow so shall you reap

48
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,850
King Drupad.

49
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,820
But, it's reassuring

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,890
that Draupadi will overcome
all her sorrow

51
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,050
and find a place among the
great women of the Aryans.

52
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,910
In the future, Draupadi will
be worshipped, Your Highness.

53
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,950
Now you should welcome
your five sons-in-law.

54
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,860
Vasudev Krishna is here,
princess.

55
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,810
Draupadi...

56
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,850
Are you happy with your
decision, dear?

57
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,550
Calm down, Draupadi.

58
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,520
Govind, what have I done?

59
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,780
How could I make such
a decision?

60
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,620
How could I have even thought
of this abomination?

61
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,590
How can a woman marry
five men?

62
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,650
This is immoral, Govind.

63
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,520
Absolutely immoral.

64
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,650
Why did you take such
an immoral decision, Draupadi?

65
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,560
What else could I have done?

66
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,560
How could I have allowed
mother Kunti's four sons

67
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,610
to become ascetics?

68
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,610
The mere thought would have
broken her heart.

69
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,550
But for my happiness

70
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,680
she didn't shed even a tear.

71
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,710
How could I be selfish

72
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
and think only about myself?

73
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,450
And Prince Arjun...

74
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,490
I have seen the disappointment
on his face.

75
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,680
How could I have
any desires, then?

76
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,550
How could I have let the four
princes make such a sacrifice

77
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,710
for my happiness?

78
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,420
And the whole community has
expectations from their princes.

79
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,660
How could I have disappointed
the whole community?

80
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,650
That's why I was forced to
be unrighteous.

81
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,450
I couldn't find any other way.

82
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,560
After considering the happiness
of so many people

83
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,590
you arrived at this decision,
Draupadi.

84
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,590
How could it be immoral?

85
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,280
After considering the happiness
of so many people

86
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,020
you arrived at this decision,
Draupadi.

87
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,060
How could it be immoral?

88
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,250
When a tiny pebble enters
a shell in the ocean

89
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,990
the shell turns it

90
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,210
into a pearl.

91
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,990
You, too, have turned
this immorality

92
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,190
into righteousness.

93
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,190
I am proud of you, Draupadi.

94
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,010
Govind...

95
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,090
The gift you gave me.

96
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,950
The five stones.

97
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,020
The five pillars of
righteousness.

98
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,050
When I saw them

99
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,050
I felt as if

100
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,080
you were ordering me to

101
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,920
marry the five Pandavas.

102
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,150
Govind...

103
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,950
Do you really consider
this to be moral?

104
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,920
No...

105
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,010
Never.

106
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,020
I cannot call this righteous

107
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,050
and fill the hearts of all
the women in the world

108
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,990
with sorrow.

109
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,950
It is immoral.

110
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,150
And it will always be immoral.

111
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,050
But...

112
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,860
Your compassion has made
you do this.

113
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,050
And compassion is the basis
of righteousness.

114
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,010
I don't understand, Govind.

115
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,080
The gift of five stones
that I gave you

116
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,050
was advice about righteousness.

117
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,910
Righteousness cannot
be demanded.

118
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,860
But you gave the five pillars
of righteousness

119
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,060
a place in your heart.

120
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,020
Knowledge calms the intellect.

121
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,820
Patience calms the mind.

122
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,960
Love soothes the heart.

123
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,920
And devotion
calms physical needs

124
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,790
and soothes the body.

125
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,820
And justice...

126
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,860
Justice calms the soul.

127
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,890
The mind, intellect, the heart,
the body and the soul

128
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,890
when these five pillars of
righteousness

129
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,890
are calm and steady

130
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,820
a human being is full
of compassion.

131
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,910
That is called righteousness.

132
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,720
And on the basis of
this righteousness

133
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,890
you have made this decision,
Draupadi.

134
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,890
And thus for you
and only you

135
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,720
it isn't a sin.

136
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,980
How will I live

137
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,960
with five husbands, Govind?

138
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,440
How will I live

139
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,530
with five husbands, Govind?

140
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,500
How will I be able to be
fair to all of them?

141
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,610
How will I fulfill my duties?

142
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,600
And the society...

143
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,440
How will I bear the taunts
of society?

144
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,600
The kind of thoughts people
would have about me, Govind!

145
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,500
Those who are righteous

146
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,440
are worshipped by God Himself.

147
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,670
You were born from fire.

148
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,410
And fire is also known
as the purifier.

149
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,630
It purifies everyone.

150
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,570
It destroys bad elements.

151
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,410
I believe

152
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,530
all those who come close
to you will be purified.

153
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,410
Don't worry, dear.

154
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,310
Whenever you need

155
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,440
any kind of help in life

156
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,530
then I

157
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,600
your friend

158
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,430
Vasudev Krishna

159
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,280
will come to you.

160
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,470
I promise you.

161
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,440
You only have to carry

162
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,380
the five pillars of
righteousness.

163
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,540
The throne of Hastinapur
awaits you.
