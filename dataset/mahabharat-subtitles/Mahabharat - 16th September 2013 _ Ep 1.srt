1
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,280
This peace and satisfaction.

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,120
I get it only when I am
with you, Satyavati.

3
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,230
The responsibilities
of the kingdom, war

4
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,270
struggle, schemes,
strategies.

5
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,040
The debate about
justice and injustice.

6
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,170
Everything is just lost
to me.

7
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,210
What more could anyone
wish for, Satyavati?

8
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,040
The desire to live,
Your Highness.

9
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,030
During the time of struggles
we realise

10
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,060
that we are alive.

11
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,310
This means you like struggles

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,280
and not peace.

13
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,300
The ones who have
all the pleasures

14
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,310
value peace.

15
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,300
The ones with only peace

16
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,220
would desire
for pleasures first.

17
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,260
And peace is attained
only after struggle

18
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,270
isn't it, King Shantanu?

19
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,130
Satyavati!

20
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,270
What are you doing, Satyavati?

21
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,140
Trying to attain pleasure.

22
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,250
Let it go, Satyavati.

23
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,040
That's a very powerful fish.

24
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,210
You wouldn't able to catch it.

25
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,250
Really?
I'm the daughter of Matysaraj.

26
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,230
Stop, Your Highness!

27
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,030
I place you under an oath.
You shouldn't try to help me.

28
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,160
Leave it, Satyavati.
I will order the fishermen.

29
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,040
They will catch
the fish for you.

30
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,220
I cannot wait until then,
Your Highness!

31
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,180
A fish and an opportunity

32
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,200
should be grabbed
once spotted.

33
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,230
Satyavati!

34
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,060
I wasn't aware that these
delicate hands were so powerful.

35
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,190
King Shantanu, you
are a warrior.

36
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,300
You are the king of a great
kingdom like Hastinapur.

37
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,270
You must be aware that
power doesn't lie in our hands

38
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,340
but instead in our hearts.

39
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
A desire is the strength
of the heart.

40
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,040
As much as can be gathered
in the cusp of one's palms

41
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,280
desires stay good only in
that measure, Satyavati.

42
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,050
Your Highness,
God has given us such tiny eyes.

43
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,050
But the same eyes

44
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,270
have the power to see
the limitless skies.

45
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,290
Am I not right, Your Highness?

46
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,200
How can I then humiliate God
by having such humble desires?

47
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,050
Desires, hopes

48
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,290
expectations, ambitions

49
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,200
are the driving forces
of a human society.

50
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,190
Aren't they?

51
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,300
If someone asks you

52
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,240
of your identity

53
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,210
what would be your answer?

54
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,100
Think about it.

55
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,290
You will immediately
realise that your desires

56
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,150
define your life.

57
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,310
The success after
achieving something

58
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,250
and the failure after not
achieving something

59
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,330
describes your identity.

60
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,280
Many people live a life

61
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,290
dying to achieve
many things

62
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,300
but their desires
never do really die.

63
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,310
Desires make them
run around

64
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,140
akin mirages of oasis make
cervids chase them.

65
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,120
But in the very womb
of these desires

66
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,180
lies the light of knowledge.

67
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,310
How?

68
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,220
When the desires are unfulfilled

69
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,260
and they shatter

70
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,200
from the same,
rays of knowledge enter into

71
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,170
the human heart.

72
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,260
No.

73
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,240
This isn't a story about
the battle of desires.

74
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,280
It isn't a story of any horrific
battue born of ambitions.

75
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,040
This story is about

76
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,120
the knowledge which arises
from the womb of desires.

77
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,210
I

78
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,050
Vasudev Krishna

79
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,290
invite all of you join
this journey

80
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,140
which would teach
you the meaning of life.

81
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,210
It will teach you the duty
of a human being.

82
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,110
It would teach you the deeds
to rise and shine from the dirt.

83
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,300
The name of this journey is

84
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,160
Mahabharata.

85
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,060
'A village in Hastinapur.'

86
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,270
Where are you,
King Shantanu!

87
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,180
Protect your subjects!

88
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Hastinapur has been cursed!

89
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,300
The king has no wife.

90
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,240
The king cannot conduct
a 'yajna'* without a wife.
* Sacrificial ritual.

91
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,250
A kingdom which doesn't
conduct 'yajna'

92
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,150
is cursed by the Gods.

93
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,020
Who will now save the
kingdom of Hastinapur?

94
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,300
Pushpak!

95
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,060
Who are you, who has dared
to challenge demon Hida?!

96
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,290
Challenges are thrown
at warriors.

97
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,270
Dacoits are warned, Hida!

98
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,120
Demons like you must
stay at Rakshashvarth.

99
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,060
You are restricted from entering
the realm of the Bharat lineage.

100
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,060
People of the Bharat lineage
chop down forests of our realm.

101
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,230
They attack on our lands.

102
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,090
If that is true

103
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,300
I promise you

104
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,150
hereafter the people of the
Bharat lineage and the demons

105
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,080
wouldn't enter into
each other's lands.

106
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,200
You should free the villagers.

107
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Stop!

108
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,500
How dare you enter into
Shantanu's kingdom, demon?

109
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,600
No demon will be spared now.

110
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,650
Attack!

111
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,650
Stop!

112
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,660
These demons have accepted
our refuge.

113
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,460
Hereafter, they wouldn't
attack the land of Bharat.

114
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,400
And now

115
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,600
no one would attack them.

116
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,430
Who are you to order?

117
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,580
What's the power that
grants you such audacity?

118
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,580
The proof of power
should always be any combat

119
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,510
is not deemed a mandate.

120
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,490
Not with words

121
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,560
but you should prove your
power by your deeds.

122
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,620
How will you protect
the demons?

123
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,630
My army is standing
before them.

124
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,450
There is no way
they could escape.

125
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
The river Ganga would
stop flowing.

126
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,450
And the pathway of river Ganga

127
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,640
will become their way.

128
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,390
No one can stop
river Ganga from flowing.

129
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,580
Who are you?

130
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,440
How could Ganga answer
your prayers and stop flowing?

131
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,470
'Because not even Lord Shiva
can decline His child's pleas.'

132
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,600
Greetings, mother.

133
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,360
Is he your son?

134
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,470
Nof mine but ours, King.

135
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,580
25 years ago when I was taking
our child along with me

136
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,590
I had promised you

137
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,490
that I will make Devarath
capable of becoming your heir.

138
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,480
Devarath, my son.

139
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,520
No, son.

140
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,580
Your place is in my heart.

141
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,590
Son, you do not know

142
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,550
I was waiting for you
day and night.

143
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,470
Your son has been trained by Parashuram* himself, King.
*Rama with the Axe (parashu). The sixth incarnation of Vishnu.

144
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,470
I have fulfilled my promise.

145
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,440
Ganga never falters
from her promises.

146
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,570
I was the unfortunate one

147
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,620
to break the promise
that I had given you.

148
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,430
Else

149
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,560
today you would have been
my wife

150
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,370
and the Queen of Hastinapur.

151
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,570
I has asked for such a promise

152
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,550
that you had to
break sometime.

153
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,460
And about being the queen

154
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,370
then a river is the queen of all
the places that are her shores.

155
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,490
Mother.

156
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,590
I am not distancing from you.

157
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,470
Whenever you call me

158
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,580
I will appear before you.

159
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,490
Leave. Now you should
go with your father.

160
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,430
The purpose of your
life is to serve him.

161
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,550
As you command, mother.

162
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,490
Look, King Shantanu
is coming this way!

163
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,630
Your Highness?

164
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,460
King Shantanu

165
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,600
what is Hastinapur
celebrating today?

166
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,600
Satyavati, my son has
returned today.

167
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,600
25 years ago

168
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,540
Ganga had married me in
the form of a woman.

169
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,360
After our son Devarath was born
she took him away.

170
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,620
But she had promised me

171
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,560
that once our son is
capable enough

172
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,580
she would bring him to me.

173
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,560
And today

174
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,450
she has fulfilled the promise,
Satyavati.

175
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,600
Today he will be enthroned
as the crown prince.

176
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,520
Sa...
Satyavati?

177
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,590
Let's go, Satyavati.
I am here to take you.

178
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,500
Why are you staring
at me, Satyavati?

179
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,630
Your Highness, I was looking
at your face.

180
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,530
Every day, you are happy
when you meet me.

181
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,520
But today

182
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,570
you have brought happiness
along with you.

183
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,430
You are right.

184
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,640
I am very happy today.

185
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,550
I will announce Devarath
as the king very soon.

186
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,550
After that

187
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,480
I relieve myself of all
the responsibilities

188
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,610
to spend the rest of
my life happily with you.

189
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,490
Will you keep me happy,
by being my wife?

190
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,350
Sure, Your Highness.

191
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,630
To love someone makes
a woman the most happy.

192
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,360
To achieve someone's love
is her biggest fortune.

193
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,580
I am blessed to have achieved
your love, Your Highness.

194
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,580
I

195
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,620
have no other desires,
Your Highness.

196
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,650
We would have a home
by this riverbank.

197
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,530
You will hunt fishes.

198
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,550
I will go and sell them
in the city.

199
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,560
What makes you laugh,
Your Highness?

200
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,530
I wonder if,
the Queen of Hastinapur

201
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,500
sells fishes on the roads
of Hastinapur

202
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,610
what would the countrymen think?

203
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,680
King, isn't a queen someone

204
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,450
whose son is entitled
to the throne?

205
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,450
Others are considered
as mere maids.

206
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,590
Rather than surviving as a maid
in the palace of Hastinapur

207
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,360
it's better I choose

208
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,530
fishing as my occupation, like
my father and spend our lives.

209
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,570
Your Highness, I hadn't loved
you having any expectations.

210
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,620
But my self-respect
is very dear to me.

211
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,550
Because after becoming your wife

212
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,490
my dignity would be
your dignity, Your Highness.

213
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,460
I tremble by the thought
of our future, Your Highness.

214
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,450
When Devarath's wife
comes to Hastinapur

215
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,590
what would be my plight,
Your Highness?

216
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,630
Here, I am the daughter
of the king of fishermen.

217
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,630
But at Hastinapur

218
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,470
I will be a stepmother
to the King of Hastinapur.

219
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,380
And when a stepson
is given the ruling authority

220
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,440
the state of a stepmother
is worse than a maid.

221
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,620
What would be
the plight of my sons?

222
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,390
They would only be serving
the king of Hastinapur.

223
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,620
Your Highness, let alone
saplings in the shade of trees

224
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,380
even grass is absent.

225
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,530
I cannot seize Devarath's rights
and hand it over to you sons.

226
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,390
But, Your Highness

227
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,510
Devarath has arrived recently.

228
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,640
I had not known about
his existence until now.

229
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,510
But when you promised to make
me the Queen of Hastinapur

230
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,490
my sons were already awarded
the rights to become the prince.

231
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,610
What are you rambling about,
Satyavati?!

232
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,450
Devarath will become
the prince of Hastinapur!

233
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,490
In that case, I would
be helpless, Your Highness.

234
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,540
You should coronate your son

235
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,620
and then you can come here.

236
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,600
But I would stay at Hastinapur

237
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,610
only as the Queen.

238
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,540
The greed for a golden fish

239
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,590
eventually led your hands
to bleed, Satyavati.

240
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,450
This greed

241
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,450
would make your heart bleed.

242
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,480
Hail the King!
- Hail!

243
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,600
Father.

244
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,480
Aren't you keeping well?

245
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,530
I am fine, son.

246
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,620
But your face...
- It's nothing.

247
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,600
Subjects!
Courtiers!

248
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,490
Today, I, Shantanu

249
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,650
announce my son, Devarath

250
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,590
as the prince of Hastinapur!

251
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,560
Hail the Prince!
- Hail him!

252
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,940
'King, isn't a queen someone'

253
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,730
'whose son is entitled
to the throne?'

254
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,860
'Others are considered
as mere maids.'

255
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,880
'Here, I am the daughter
of the king of fishermen.'

256
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,890
'At Hastinapur, I will be a
stepmother to the king.'

257
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,940
'But I would stay at Hastinapur'

258
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,810
'only as the Queen.'

259
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,680
Father.

260
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,770
If a son cannot perceive the
sorrow on his father's face

261
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,790
then he ought to be blind.

262
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,960
What is the cause
of your anguish?

263
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,700
After all...

264
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,700
Father, what is the sorrow that
your son cannot do away with?

265
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,780
Everyone says that
Devarath is very powerful.

266
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,940
But I have surrendered
before your grief.

267
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,910
Everyone says that Devarath
is very knowledgeable.

268
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:19,690
But, I am unable to find a way
to make my father happy.

269
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,880
Then...

270
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,700
Of what use is then the
power and the knowledge?

271
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,970
Father

272
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,940
until I do not find a
way to make you happy

273
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,820
I would abstain
from food.

274
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,840
No, son.

275
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,710
You shouldn't take such an oath.

276
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,920
Son, my heart is the
reason of my agony.

277
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,890
Your son can fulfil all your
wishes, father.

278
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,800
You should tell me

279
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,880
the worries that have
you so bogged down.

280
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,870
I will free you of
all the worries.

281
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,850
Son, I do not wish

282
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,880
to get rid of this agony.

283
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,940
I just want to learn to
live with this agony.

284
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,850
No, father.

285
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,870
My father be fraught
with worries all his life

286
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,690
is something completely
unacceptable to me.

287
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,940
I will surely find the reason
of your grief

288
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,800
and also find a solution
for the same.

289
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,980
Devarath!

290
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,820
Son...

291
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,760
Where can I find lady Satyavati?

292
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,930
Greetings, lady.

293
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,950
Why have you come here?

294
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,940
I have come to you for alms.

295
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,940
My father's happiness as alms.

296
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,950
My father loves you immensely.

297
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,790
He is unhappy and bereaved
by staying away from you.

298
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,890
Seeing your father unhappy

299
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,690
you shouldn't be unjust
to me, Prince.

300
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,850
I too am unhappy by staying
away from him.

301
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,700
If the separation is
bothering both of you

302
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,910
then what is the cause
for the separation?

303
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,790
If I marry your father
after smothering my desires

304
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,940
then my heart will
grieve forever.

305
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,780
I will never be at peace.

306
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,680
The one who isn't at peace

307
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,930
can never make others happy.

308
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,900
The shadow of a burning tree

309
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,680
does fall on the earth.

310
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,740
But no one can sit
under the shade that is cast.

311
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,940
What does Hastinapur lack
that would cause you unrest?

312
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,800
My happiness comes with respect.

313
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,740
How would I be
respected there?

314
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,790
What place would I be
given at Hastinapur?

315
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,950
What will be my position?

316
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,910
You will be the
Queen of Hastinapur.

317
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,890
You will be the Royal Mother.

318
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,960
Prince, a Royal Mother is
the mother of a prince.

319
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,790
I would accept you as my mother.

320
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,930
I'll honour you and bestow upon
you the rights of a mother.

321
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,790
The one you accept
isn't the truth

322
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,910
but a feeling.

323
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,910
Just like a shadow.

324
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,830
And a shadow

325
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,940
is always on the opposite
side of the light, Prince.

326
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,880
No, Prince.

327
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,880
I would become unfortunate
if I marry your father.

328
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,700
The ones who are looked at
by King Shantanu

329
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,940
become fortunate.

330
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,840
How can you be unfortunate
by attaining the king's love?

331
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,700
No, that will not happen.

332
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,950
It would, Prince.

333
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,950
Not only I

334
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,990
but my children would be
unfortunate also.

335
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,910
Your son will become
the king after you.

336
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,830
What would be the future
of my children?

337
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,690
They wouldn't even posses
the fishing skills.

338
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,840
They have to accept a
lowly position in the army

339
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,740
and be satisfied.

340
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,900
For you and the sake of your son

341
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,810
they would be destined to die
in the war and nothing else.

342
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,720
Are you trying to say, I am the
reason of my father's agony?

343
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,950
For 25 years

344
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,920
I have dreamed about my
father's love for me.

345
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,860
I have yearned for his
love and blessings.

346
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,920
And you...

347
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,920
Are you saying that

348
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,730
I am a misfortune to him?

349
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,770
No, Prince.

350
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,670
You are his fortune.

351
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,910
But, King Shantanu

352
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,980
can get only one
among two joys.

353
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,830
Either to stay with his
son at the palace

354
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,850
or to live with his wife
in this humble home.

355
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,890
Both of the joys together
are impossible for him.

356
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,970
No, lady-

357
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,870
My father will have
both the joys

358
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,790
and together.
