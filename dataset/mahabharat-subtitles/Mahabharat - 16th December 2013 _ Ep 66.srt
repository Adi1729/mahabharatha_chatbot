1
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,210
Brother

2
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,340
bowing before the wind does not
rob a tree of its strength.

3
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,120
Sailing with
the current of the ocean

4
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,120
does not insult a sea vessel.

5
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,120
Surrendering my weapons to you

6
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,210
is not an insult to me.

7
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,080
In fact, it is an honour

8
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,310
brother Yudhishthir.

9
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,310
I have a feeling that

10
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,110
when it comes to strength
and military strategies

11
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,150
you are superior to me.

12
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,080
Regarding the decision to crown
you as the Prince of Hastinapur

13
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,170
me

14
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,240
and my brothers

15
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,220
accept it.

16
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,070
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

17
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,950
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

18
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,140
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

19
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,920
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

20
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,880
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

21
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,880
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

22
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,140
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

23
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,980
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

24
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,050
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

25
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,880
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

26
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,950
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

27
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,920
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

28
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,920
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

29
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,920
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

30
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,050
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

31
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,970
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

32
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,980
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

33
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,070
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

34
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,880
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

35
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,820
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

36
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,080
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

37
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,880
All hail Prince Yudhishthir!

38
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,610
Brother Bheem,
what are you doing?

39
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,640
I had soaked these bitter gourds

40
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,640
overnight in a sugar solution,
Sahadev

41
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,440
but they still taste bitter.

42
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,630
If you soak them
for a year then maybe

43
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,640
they won't taste bitter,
brother.

44
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,630
If Duryodhan can change then
bitter gourds stand no chance.

45
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,510
Even if you soak them for life

46
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,510
there won't be any change
in them, Nakul

47
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,480
because bitter gourds are
defined by their bitterness.

48
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,470
Think positively, Bheem.

49
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,640
All of you should
try to think positively.

50
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,640
No one can have
such a weak heart

51
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,630
where righteousness
cannot dwell.

52
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,410
My heart isn't that weak, uncle

53
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,570
that righteousness
can dwell within it.

54
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,600
Five!

55
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,430
Do not say so, son.

56
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,540
Righteousness is
the basis of this world.

57
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,540
You cannot resort to
unrighteousness, son.

58
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,540
What is righteousness, mother?

59
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,400
What is it?

60
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,440
Righteousness is for

61
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
the solace of incompetent
and weak people.

62
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,410
The Almighty gave us a heart

63
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
and desires along with it.

64
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,470
Then how can
fulfilling those desires

65
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,570
be deemed unrighteous by anyone?

66
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,340
No, mother.

67
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,340
I know what righteousness is.

68
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,440
I have been taught enough
about it in the 'gurukul'

69
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,530
but pardon me, mother

70
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,570
I cannot live by it.

71
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,340
I have just one goal.

72
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,500
To have the throne
of Hastinapur.

73
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,310
Mother, the blessed event
I had been awaiting since birth

74
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,540
is drawing closer now.

75
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,330
Which blessed event
were you awaiting, son?

76
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,270
Greetings, mother.

77
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,430
At the time of my birth

78
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,430
when I had asked the great sage Vashishtha*
*One of the Saptarishis (seven great Rishis) in the seventh, i.e. the present Manvantara, or age of Manu.

79
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,380
about the path to my
enlightenment, he had said

80
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,240
that after fulfilling
all my duties on this earth

81
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,230
if, on the day
of the summer solstice

82
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,370
I leave this
earthly vessel of mine

83
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,270
then the Lord of the Sun
will take me northward

84
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,380
and show me the way to heaven.

85
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,410
Mother

86
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,400
Yudhishthir was crowned
as the Prince today.

87
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,480
Today, the royal court
of Hastinapur

88
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,500
was blessed with righteousness.

89
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,300
Today...

90
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,470
Today, I accomplished
the goal of my life, mother.

91
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,210
Are you certain

92
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,430
that Duryodhan has curbed

93
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,410
his ambitions?

94
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,410
But after the crowning
ceremony of the Prince

95
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,170
Yudhishthir and his brothers

96
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,270
will be able to protect
themselves from Duryodhan.

97
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,430
That is why...

98
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,270
That is why, today

99
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,410
my purpose was served, mother.

100
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,370
How can just one incident

101
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,280
fulfill the purpose
of someone's life, Bhishma?

102
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,300
The purpose
of one's life is served

103
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,310
only when he is free of
all ties and relationships.

104
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,240
But mother

105
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,240
I have no ties.

106
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,180
I was merely
carrying out my duties.

107
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Even a duty is a tie, son.

108
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,300
Until you find the way

109
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,210
to free yourself from this tie

110
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,330
you will not be completely free.

111
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,380
Do not say so, mother.

112
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,140
Even after leading
a righteous life

113
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
how can I not be free?

114
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,140
Mother

115
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,170
how can I finally be free?

116
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
I cannot tell you that

117
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,300
but very soon

118
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,300
someone will arrive

119
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,380
who will make you realize
your true duty.

120
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,310
Not only you, son

121
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,130
but also the entire world

122
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,270
will learn about
its true duties.

123
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,230
When you will
attain that knowledge

124
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,340
you will finally find yourself
to be free.

125
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Righteousness.

126
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,260
Everyone meditates over it.

127
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,290
Some discuss their own

128
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,130
and some, about that of others.

129
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,220
People keep discussing
someone else's unrighteousness.

130
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,270
There is no one who has never
meditated over righteousness.

131
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,300
But in true terms

132
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,200
what does righteousness mean?

133
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,290
Has anyone ever been
able to understand it?

134
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,290
Righteousness

135
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,320
teaches man how to
live with others

136
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,130
and to live with
the entire creation in peace.

137
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,260
This is the reason why
in the presence of righteousness

138
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,290
man always feels at peace.

139
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,030
Have you not experienced it?

140
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,260
In other words, righteousness
ends all of man's struggles.

141
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,170
But how can it be possible
for a man to not have

142
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,100
any struggle with another?

143
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,160
Think about it.

144
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,060
Does struggle also exist
in the presence of love?

145
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,070
Your answer to this
would be 'yes'

146
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,130
but if you think a little more
about it, you will know

147
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,260
that when one struggles
with something

148
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,060
one forgets about love.

149
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
And then

150
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,260
desires come to the forefront

151
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,090
arrogance and anger come
to the forefront but love?

152
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,230
No.

153
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,130
Love does not
come to the forefront

154
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,030
because when love
comes to the forefront

155
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,030
all arguments, all struggles
and all fights

156
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,090
come to an end.

157
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,170
What if such a love develops
for the entire world?

158
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,220
Not only for mankind

159
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,120
but also for flora and fauna
and even a blade of grass

160
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,060
if one has love in one's heart

161
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,070
then can anger ever exist in it?

162
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,160
Certainly not.

163
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,000
The feeling of love that exists
in one person for another

164
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,960
if that same love is
extended to the entire creation

165
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,130
then it is termed as compassion.

166
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,930
Compassion, in other words

167
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,970
to accept the entire world.

168
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,130
To have nothing
but love for everyone.

169
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,060
To not protest against anyone.

170
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,090
Compassion is truly
the essence of righteousness.

171
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,900
If righteousness is a tree,
compassion is its basis

172
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,160
and its root.

173
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,160
But there are instances
in life when man

174
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,960
completely forgets
the basis of righteousness.

175
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,060
He clings to a few rules
and traditions.

176
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,890
But compassion?

177
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,070
He forgets all about it.

178
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,990
And the world gets
permeated with struggles

179
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,890
with jealousies

180
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,160
with exploitation, with anger,
with hatred!

181
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,090
In other words,
with unrighteousness.

182
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,120
And then

183
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,030
the Almighty is required
to take an avatar

184
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,070
to impart the right knowledge
to man.

185
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,830
The epic of Mahabharat
is a tale of a time

186
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,130
when some people would deem
traditions to be righteous

187
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,990
while others were unrighteous

188
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,990
and were stuck in the vortex
of anger, hatred and ambitions

189
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,900
thus leading to the destruction
of righteousness.

190
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,090
Back then, people loved others

191
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,030
but they lacked love
for the entire world.

192
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,070
There was no compassion
back then.

193
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,930
That is why, I

194
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
took an avatar.

195
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,960
'Paﬂtranaya Sadhunam.'

196
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,090
For the upliftment
of the good and virtuous.

197
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,960
'Vinashaya Cha Dushkritam!'

198
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,030
For the destruction of evil
and evil-doers!

199
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,920
'Dharma Sansthapanarthaya!'

200
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,990
For the re-establishment
of righteousness

201
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,000
I, Vasudeva Krishna,
am going to arrive

202
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,000
in the epic of Mahabharat!
