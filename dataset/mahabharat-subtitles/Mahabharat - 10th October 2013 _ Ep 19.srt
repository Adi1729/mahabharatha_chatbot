1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,800
Let me go, father!
- I said, stop.

2
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,780
Father, I have to go
welcome them! - You are a fool.

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,670
Who asked you to welcome them
in this manner?

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,740
Why? Did you not enjoy
the spectacle?

5
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,700
I only wished
to please the king.

6
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,820
You wished to please him?

7
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,610
Do you think competing against
the king will please him?

8
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,710
You are better at archery
than any 'Kshatriya'.

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,700
Upon knowing this, will it
please the king or anger him?

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,610
I have explained it to you
so many times.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
The son of a charioteer
should behave like one.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,770
Son, your skills won't
please the king

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,750
but your dedication towards
him will.

14
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,650
No, father.
Our king is not like that.

15
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,740
And look at the face
of the Queen.

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,610
She has such an
affectionate look.

17
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Just like mother Radha.

18
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,790
Let me go, father!

19
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,790
No, Karna.
Karna, no.

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,670
Look at that, your Highness.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,660
A group of people from
the forest are here.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
They must have welcomed you so.

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,560
Long live King Pandu!

24
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,610
Long live King Pandu!

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,570
Long live King Pandu!

26
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,550
Four.

27
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,780
One, two, three, four.

28
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,650
One is bound to come across
obstacles, Sanjay

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,790
but the one who knows
how to overcome them

30
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,530
is the one who never loses.

31
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,780
But some obstacles

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,700
cannot be overcome, Shakuni.

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,640
Those are like shackles of fate.

34
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,560
True, your Highness.

35
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,660
You are absolutely correct.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,610
Some obstacles are like
shackles of fate.

37
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,650
Sanjay, tell me.

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,710
How will you overcome
the obstacle you face?

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,720
If the dice roll...

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,690
Yes. If I score six points,
I can overcome this obstacle.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,750
In other words, the dice can
liberate you from the shackles.

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,800
You need to befriend
your dice, Sanjay.

43
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,580
Befriend them!

44
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,710
I am not talking about
a game of dice

45
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,690
but about life.
- Life!

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,790
Life!

47
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,680
I too am talking about life,
your Highness.

48
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,830
It is all in our heads.

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,660
We have memories.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,600
Walks on two legs.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,600
We see him around us

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,710
but we

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,810
mistake him a for a human being,
your Highness.

54
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,740
Who are you talking about,
Shakuni?

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,740
Prince Pandu

56
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,620
who has recently returned
after getting married.

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,560
To me, welcoming him is like
rolling the dice right.

58
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,650
Sister, why is
Gandhari not here?

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,550
Sukta said that

60
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,650
Dhritarashtra does not
want Gandhari

61
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,730
to welcome the new couple.

62
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,680
But the new bride must be
welcomed by Gandhari, sister.

63
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,760
Ambalika

64
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,550
even Gandhari was welcomed
by Kripacharya's wife.

65
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,640
It was so for there was
no married woman

66
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,540
in our family back then.

67
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,710
But if there is a married woman
in the family

68
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,690
and yet we make someone else
give the traditional welcome

69
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,650
wouldn't that be an ill omen,
Queen Mother?

70
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,830
I shall let no ill omen befall
my family, mother Ambalika.

71
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,560
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Greetings.

72
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,760
Greetings.

73
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,570
I welcome
the Queen of Hastinapur.

74
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,690
Sister-in-law

75
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,680
My wife wishes to seek
your blessings.

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,780
Do bless her.

77
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,790
What do I bless you with, Kunti?

78
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,680
A happy married life,
children

79
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,660
a long live and welfare...

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,750
You have already been
blessed with all this.

81
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,710
Bless her by saying that
her wishes will come true

82
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,560
and that she will
face no obstacles.

83
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,700
Recognize the pawns,
your Highness

84
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,660
and keep rolling the dice.

85
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,830
All the obstacles

86
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,710
will be eliminated.

87
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,600
You are correct,
mother Ambalika.

88
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,570
And blessings
get rid of obstacles.

89
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,660
Where is brother Dhritarashtra?

90
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,570
Is he still angry?

91
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,380
Kunti, all the daughters-in-law
of the family

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,330
install their family
deities in this temple.

93
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,460
Give the priest the idol
of your family deity

94
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,200
for the consecration
ritual of the idol.

95
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,170
Sister-in-law

96
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,350
I have been blessed by everyone

97
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,400
but

98
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,200
neither did I get the
blessings of brother-in-law

99
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,380
nor did I get to meet him.

100
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,200
In the journey from the kingdom
of Kunti to Hastinapur

101
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,300
my Lord was talking
only about his elder brother.

102
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,300
His valour, his generosity

103
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,210
his fondness towards my Lord...

104
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,370
He said

105
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,450
that if his elder brother
blesses me

106
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,230
I would not require blessings

107
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,430
even from the Almighty.

108
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,190
I do not know, sister-in-law

109
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,440
whether or not I have the right
to say this.

110
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,410
Please pardon me.

111
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,310
But, sister-in-law

112
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,450
what I heard in Kuntinagar

113
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,250
is making me a little restless.

114
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,390
Absence of a festoon
at the entrance of a house

115
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,420
is not a matter of concern,
sister-in-law.

116
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,290
But the presence of a single
thorn in the orchard of a house

117
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,230
is not good.

118
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,410
There is no thorn
in this orchard, Kunti.

119
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,190
Your brother-in-law
has a very big heart.

120
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,280
To say it cannot house
his brother and his wife in it

121
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,450
is out of the question.

122
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,420
If you have heard that there's
a conflict between them

123
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,250
then it is untrue.

124
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,190
Some conniver must have
started this rumour.

125
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,460
Your brother-in-law has
boundless love for Pandu.

126
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,270
If love and deceit
compete against each other

127
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,310
love always triumphs.

128
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,480
Deceit always triumphs,
your Highness. - Deceit!

129
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,210
A warrior engages in a battle,
Shakuni

130
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,400
and not in deceit.

131
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,250
Battle!

132
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,310
Battle.

133
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,420
Deceit is like a battle,
your Highness.

134
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,190
A battle of the mind.

135
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,340
Do not consider deceit
to be bad, your Highness.

136
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,360
The people who get hurt
because of our actions

137
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,420
call it deceit

138
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,280
and the ones who benefit from it

139
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,370
call it strategy, your Highness.

140
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,320
In this game of life

141
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,350
Prince Pandu rolled the
dice perfectly

142
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,160
and defeated us.

143
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,320
Even I harbour

144
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,290
nothing but hatred
towards King Pandu.

145
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,230
Hate.

146
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,320
But now, we must
keep our minds calm

147
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,350
control our anger

148
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,310
come up with a new game

149
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,220
and defeat Prince Pandu.

150
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,220
Attention!

151
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,350
King Pandu is
making his entrance!

152
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,210
Welcome, King Pandu.
Welcome.

153
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,380
Greetings.
- Greetings, Prince.

154
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,370
Savant, greetings.

155
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,450
Congratulations, your Highness.

156
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,160
Upon hearing that you
won the 'swayamvar'

157
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,290
my brother-in-law told me

158
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,260
that his younger brother
can never lose.

159
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,170
Greetings, brother.

160
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,190
May you live long.

161
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,420
Kunti and I were waiting for you
to bless us, brother.

162
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,430
Brother-in-law could not make it

163
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,410
only because of me.

164
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,440
He kept saying that
you would have reached

165
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,240
but I insisted

166
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,230
on playing one final
round of the game.

167
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,190
Then he was free to go.

168
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,220
Even I have heard that you
love these dice dearly, Prince.

169
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,250
Love!

170
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,280
Love!

171
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,390
You may assume they are two
wives of mine, your Highness.

172
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,240
Two dutiful wives.

173
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,140
Brother...

174
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,210
Kunti wishes to come
here to seek your blessings.

175
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,180
If you allow me then
may I go and get her?

176
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,250
I-Indeed...
- No!

177
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,300
No, we should go and greet her.

178
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,420
It is the right of a new bride

179
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,360
that everyone goes to
her to welcome her.

180
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,290
Your Highness...

181
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,160
I request you
to allow brother-in-law

182
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,400
to bless her Highness
tomorrow morning.

183
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,400
Besides, he does not have
anything to gift her at present.

184
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,210
He must also
present her something.

185
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,340
Because the one to be blessed
is not only his daughter-in-law

186
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,200
but also
the Queen of Hastinapur.

187
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,160
Alright.

188
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,380
Tomorrow morning, we will

189
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,410
come here to seek
your blessings, brother.

190
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,250
Certainly.

191
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,360
Greetings, brother.

192
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,210
Saying that you will
certainly bless them

193
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,440
was good thinking
on your part, your Highness.

194
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,380
I think, my game of dice

195
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,200
is finally making
some sense to you.

196
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,190
While making a decision,
we always

197
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,390
deem the suggestion, advice,
aid and consultation of others

198
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,190
as our foundation.

199
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,180
And the foundation
of our future

200
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,330
depends upon our decisions
made in the present.

201
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,430
So, is our future the result

202
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,240
of someone else's advice

203
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,340
and someone else's suggestion?

204
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,260
Is our entire life the result
of someone else's intellect?

205
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,290
Have we ever thought about it?

206
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,250
Our experience tell us
that different people

207
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,160
give different advice
in the same situation.

208
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,390
A devotee in a temple
believes in charity

209
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,460
but a thief says
that given an opportunity

210
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,260
he would steal
the idol's ornaments.

211
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,380
A pious heart
dispenses righteous advice

212
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,410
and a depraved heart
dispenses unrighteous advice.

213
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,310
Accepting righteous advice
propels man towards happiness.

214
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,260
But accepting such advice
is possible only when one

215
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,450
is pious.

216
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,460
In other words, before accepting
someone's suggestion or advice

217
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,190
is fostering righteousness
within one's heart

218
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,230
not important?

219
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,340
Think about it.

220
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,790
'If one lies to gain something'

221
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,960
'then it is deception.'

222
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,960
'But if one hides the truth
to escape from harm'

223
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,810
'then it is not deception,
Princess.'

224
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,770
'And till the time you have
this thread on your wrist'

225
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,770
'you will not say anything to
your husband about your past.'

226
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,880
I will not base my life
on deception.

227
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,950
My Lord

228
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,820
should know the truth
about my past.

229
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,800
In the journey
from Kuntibhoj to Hastinapur

230
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,930
I could not muster the courage
to tell him about it.

231
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,890
We hardly had any privacy.

232
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,910
But today

233
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,810
the moment my Lord arrives

234
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,880
the first thing I will do

235
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,950
is tell him about my past.

236
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,860
My Lord, upon seeing
Karna's archery skills

237
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,870
were the King and Queen
not impressed?

238
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,880
Yes, they were impressed.

239
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,740
But when they
would have learned

240
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,910
that he is the
son of a charioteer

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,880
their amazement would have
turned to anger, Radha.

242
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,810
You are well aware, Radha

243
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,750
that people of our caste
can become only charioteers

244
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,840
and not become warriors.

245
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,750
But why, father?

246
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,800
You always tell me that
the best work

247
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,790
is always commended.

248
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,730
Do not argue with me, Karna.

249
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,920
When a person achieves
highest quality in his work

250
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,780
only then does he
garner respect.

251
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,810
But when a person
does someone else's work

252
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,910
he does not garner respect
but competition.

253
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,850
My Lord, the King will
see him as his competitor...

254
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,710
Is this what you are
trying to say?

255
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,880
And the King...
- Not the King.

256
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,930
The warriors of the kingdom
will see him as a rival.

257
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,860
Not only us, our entire
community will face their wrath.

258
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,000
I feel, the King will be pleased
and will give me a reward.

259
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,950
And father, you always say

260
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,800
that the person who protects
the best in a society

261
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,840
is a true king.

262
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,860
You are still
arguing with me, Karna!

263
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,900
I already said that this
concerns our family's safety!

264
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,910
It is the question of safety
of not only our family

265
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,920
but also of the entire society!

266
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,970
Yet you insist
on displaying your skills.

267
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,000
Alright.

268
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,880
You may do so.

269
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,810
Here is an arrow.

270
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,750
Let the entire world know

271
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,970
that a charioteer who
can defeat warriors

272
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,990
has been born in
in Hastinapur.

273
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,800
I am not concerned about
your mother and I.

274
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,940
We will brave it.

275
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,870
Pick up your bow and arrows.
Pick them up!

276
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,870
Karna...
