1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,360
The lives of my sons

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,920
is now my life,
uncle.

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,960
For a smile from their child,
a mother and father

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,440
can even sacrifice
their own lives.

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,640
No, uncle.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,240
If this war

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,280
jeopardizes the lives

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,680
of my sons

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
then I do not want
this war to take place.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,160
But Duryodhan...

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,280
My son wants this war

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,680
but I don't.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,920
What decision should I
take now, uncle?

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,800
How should I come to a decision?

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,640
You have never taken a decision
in your life, Your Highness.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,440
The way a cloth
flying in the wind

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,040
changes its direction
according to the wind's decision

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,880
you too have spent
your entire life in this manner.

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,040
And in the end

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,280
such a cloth gets stuck
on a thorny bush

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,080
and gets shredded to pieces.

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,120
Everyone knows this,
Your Highness.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,920
Do not use such
harsh words, uncle.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,160
I have not come to you
as a king.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,200
I have come here as your nephew
to seek advice from you.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,920
The time to dispense advice
has already passed.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,520
What advice should I
give you now?

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,320
Make Yudhishthir
the King of Hastinapur...

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,920
'If you willingly'

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,520
'give up your position as
the crown prince to Duryodhan...'

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,480
'Then I will not only
discharge my duties'

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,120
'but also regain my happiness.'

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Do not attempt to burn

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,400
the sons of Pandu in Varnavart...

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,200
'In Varnavart'

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,040
'uncle Pandu's family
will burn to ashes'

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,320
'along with their memories.'

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,720
Allow them to live in peace
in Indraprastha...

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,480
'Go ahead
and attack Indraprastha'

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,720
'but please give up the thought
of setting yourself on fire.'

41
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
'I do not wish
to merely defeat them, father.'

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,680
'I wish to insult them.'

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,120
Do not organise
a game of dice...

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,600
'Along with the knowledge
of the scriptures and weapons'

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,840
'a game of dice is also
a part of us Kshatriyas.'

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,400
'That is why,
my son Duryodhan'

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
'has organised a game of dice.'

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
Do not let
the daughter of Drupad

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,800
be disrobed in the court,
Your Highness...

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,360
'Maid Draupadi must obey
her master Duryodhan's'

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,160
'every command.'

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,800
Do not send the Pandavas
on an exile

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,840
and force them into a life
of anonymity, Your Highness...

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,320
'All five of the brothers
along with their wife Draupadi'

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
'will have to go
on an exile for twelve years'

56
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,560
'and live an additional year'

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
'in anonymity.'

58
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,760
What advice should I
give you, Your Highness?

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,680
I know that I have committed
numerous mistakes, uncle.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,520
I have been visionless

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,480
ever since I was born,
uncle.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
An...

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,160
An

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,040
unknown fear always

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
surrounds my heart.

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,320
Now

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
if I have made a mistake
in this state of mind

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,680
then how am I at fault?

69
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,960
Being visionless is not
your limitation, Dhritarashtra.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,800
Being visionless from your mind

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
is, however, your limitation.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,920
You never let the absence
of vision pull you down.

73
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Then why did you...

74
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,400
Why did you think that
you are less than anyone else?

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
And when an outsider

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,200
pointed out your shortcoming

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,960
why did you believe that person?

78
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,200
No outsider said anything.

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,160
You had said it.

80
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,800
Only then did I believe it.

81
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,760
When did I say

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,960
that you lag behind
others in power?

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,120
Try to recall,
uncle.

84
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Try to recall the day I was
about to be crowned the king.

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
'A person who is
blind since birth'

86
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,640
'is not worthy
of becoming the king.'

87
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
You believed
what Vidur said that day.

88
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,560
You believed that a person
who is blind since birth

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,200
cannot become the king.

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,320
That is the tradition
of the entire Aryan region.

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,760
Neither Vidur nor I
are at fault here.

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,360
The greed you had
within you, to rule

93
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,600
the kingdom
and gain power

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,640
has reduced you
to your present state.

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,840
You have never
honoured traditions.

96
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,880
That is why,
the entire Aryan region

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,800
is on the verge of a war today.

98
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
If this war takes place

99
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,080
then my sons will die.

100
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
And if it does not take place

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,600
then the Pandavas

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
will punish my sons.

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
My sons will die even then.

104
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,800
Will the advice
to avert this war

105
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,880
be acceptable to your sons,
Dhritarashtra?

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Will King Shakuni of Gandhar

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,680
allow them to accept it?

108
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,520
If you truly

109
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,320
wish to seek peace

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,680
then order
King Shakuni of Gandhar

111
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,080
to leave Hastinapur immediately.

112
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
A Garuda formation

113
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,920
can be built only
on an even ground, friend.

114
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,080
If the army of the enemy
bombards stones from a hill

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,200
then the soldiers might just
get crushed under their shields.

116
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,600
These battle formations of yours

117
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,040
are various ways to have

118
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,640
your army killed.

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,160
By talking of defeat
before the war

120
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,880
you are displaying your
weakness, King of Gandhar.

121
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,400
In the past ten years

122
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,120
I have conquered different
kingdoms in all four directions.

123
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
I have emerged victorious
in over 300 battles.

124
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,560
The uses of battle formations

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
and their importance

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
are not unknown to me.

127
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
And out of those battles,
how many were

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,560
against Vasudev Krishna

129
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,560
King of Anga?

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,160
A desert

131
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,720
may expand as much as it wants

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,640
a forest may give birth to
as much vegetation as it wants

133
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,840
and a river may flow
as fast as it can

134
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,720
but at the sea-shore

135
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
all of them

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
must come to an end.

137
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,000
Vasudev Krishna
is a formidable foe

138
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,240
and you may not know it,
King of Anga.

139
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Uncle

140
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
why does Vasudev Krishna

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,040
leave you so fearful?

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Fear?

143
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,280
One is fearful
of unknown objects, my child.

144
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,480
However, I know the powers
of Vasudev Krishna!

145
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
He is

146
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,240
so intelligent

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,480
and treacherous

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,520
that your entire...

149
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
That your entire army

150
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
can be destroyed

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
solely by him

152
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,200
in the battlefield

153
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,160
without any help.

154
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,120
A true battle formation

155
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,280
would be one

156
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,400
which would lead Vasudev Krishna

157
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,080
to be captured by you.

158
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,800
My child

159
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,680
as long as I am with you

160
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,040
you need not worry
even a bit.

161
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,080
A way to tackle Vasudev Krishna

162
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,280
is something I will
certainly find out.

163
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,360
Minister!
You are...

164
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,720
King of Gandhar,
His Highness has requested you

165
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,960
to leave the Kuru kingdom
at once

166
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,080
and proceed to Gandhar.

167
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,220
Your Highness!

168
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,100
Your Highness

169
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,780
what kind of an order
have you given?

170
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,260
What does banishing uncle

171
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,580
in this manner mean?

172
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,300
The Minister must have
been the one

173
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,940
to put forth this advice.

174
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,500
I had given
this advice, dear.

175
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,500
The King of Gandhar has damaged

176
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,580
Hastinapur's future enough.

177
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,660
It is time now

178
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,860
for Hastinapur
to think about its benefit.

179
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Does the benefit
of the Kuru kingdom

180
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,900
not imply that
of the Pandavas, grandsire?

181
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,940
Your benefit, son.

182
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,020
You

183
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,500
and your brothers are
being blessed with life.

184
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,100
What the King of Gandhar

185
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,820
and the King of Anga

186
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,340
are advising you about the war
and on what basis

187
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,580
are not known to me.

188
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,380
However, rain water

189
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,660
cannot be held

190
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,140
in the palms
of one's hands for long.

191
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,660
The day the sons of Pandu

192
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,300
come to the battlefield, in the
ensuing battle of righteousness

193
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,580
my competence too
will fall short.

194
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,900
You will understand this truth

195
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,860
when the King of Gandhar
will stop dispensing

196
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,260
his harmful advice to you.

197
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,180
The truth is
quite the opposite to this

198
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,580
Your Excellency.

199
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,980
The truth is

200
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,540
that the anger
of my dear Duryodhan

201
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,340
can be controlled
only by my advice.

202
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,100
Otherwise

203
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,420
during the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

204
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,100
when these warriors had been
stripped of their weapons

205
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,860
there would have been a war.

206
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,620
When dear Dushala's husband

207
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,300
was insulted

208
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,380
there would have been a war.

209
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,140
When Hastinapur

210
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,580
was about to be attacked
by the Pandavas

211
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,540
there would have been a war.

212
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,300
If you have

213
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,140
decided to banish me
in this manner

214
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,380
then this is your burden

215
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,460
and no one else's,
Your Excellency.

216
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Allow me to leave,
Your Highness.

217
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,340
You have permission on behalf
of His Highness, uncle.

218
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
You are welcome here.

219
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,820
And on behalf of His Highness,
it is an order, General

220
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,260
to prepare the army
for a battle.

221
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,380
Tomorrow at dawn

222
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,740
the army of Hastinapur will
attack the kingdom of Virat.

223
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,980
Tomorrow at dawn

224
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,380
the army of Hastinapur will
attack the kingdom of Virat.

225
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,580
Duryodhan!

226
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,740
No, Duryodhan.

227
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,500
This war will not
take place, son.

228
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,580
You may stop the army
of Hastinapur, father

229
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,860
but me

230
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,980
and my brothers
cannot be stopped by you.

231
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,820
You cannot stop my friend Karna!

232
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,620
We 101 warriors

233
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,660
will attack the kingdom
of Virat tomorrow!

234
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,540
Instead of living

235
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,140
this life of humiliation

236
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,180
it would be better if we die.

237
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,460
I will not change
my decision, father.

238
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,140
I will not change it!

239
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,020
Son Duryodhan...
- My child...

240
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,860
No...

241
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,820
Shedding one's blood

242
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,060
does not wash away one's insult.

243
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,700
However, if one sheds
the blood of the enemy

244
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,420
then the taint of the insult

245
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,380
gets washed away.

246
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,860
That is why

247
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,260
if victory in the war

248
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,140
is not certain

249
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,860
then shedding one's blood

250
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,140
is foolishness.

251
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,100
My darling

252
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,780
do not be intransigent
about a war.

253
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,940
At this moment

254
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,220
you must forget about the enmity

255
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,460
and all your struggles

256
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,500
and stay peaceful and calm,
because in doing so

257
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
lies your benefit.

258
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,980
King of Gandhar

259
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,700
hearing you talk
about establishing peace

260
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,540
in Hastinapur

261
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,220
is both astonishing

262
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,980
and delightful.

263
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,260
Then you may keep the delight
with yourself, Minister Vidur

264
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,820
and send

265
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,300
the astonishment
to the Pandavas.

266
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,140
And if I have made any mistake

267
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,700
then please pardon me.

268
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,060
Your Highness

269
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,740
I promise you

270
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,180
that my dear Duryodhan

271
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,020
will not refute my advice.

272
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,260
He will certainly

273
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,900
meditate over
the proposal of peace.

274
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,620
Will you honour this request

275
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,100
of your uncle,
my dear?

276
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,340
Alright.

277
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,820
If you insist

278
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,820
then I will not
attack this early.

279
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,420
However... - That is enough,
my dear.

280
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,100
That is enough.

281
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,540
As I leave the kingdom, I have
honoured His Excellency's wish.

282
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
I shall always be

283
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,540
proud of this

284
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,020
Your Excellency.

285
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,780
Allow me to leave,
Your Highness.
