1
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,070
Son...

2
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,170
Duryodhan?

3
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,180
Greetings, father.

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,330
Son.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,240
Did Bheem come
to Praman Koti with you?

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,240
No.
He did not come with me.

7
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,080
Dushala said
that she had seen him.

8
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,240
Eldest brother Yudhishthir
was occupied

9
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,200
and so was Arjun.

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,240
So, he said that he will
be there with the others.

11
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,080
Then where did Bheem go?

12
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
If he was not with Duryodhan

13
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,110
then how would Duryodhan
know about him, sire?

14
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,240
True.

15
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,200
Your majesty!
Your majesty!

16
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,230
Your majesty!
Your majesty!

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,010
Your Majesty, have me beheaded!

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,980
Have me beheaded, your Majesty!

19
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,170
I truly deserve death,
your Majesty.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,080
I truly deserve death.

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,050
After delivering
such a terrible news

22
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,110
I have no right to live,
your Majesty.

23
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,980
I have no right...

24
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you rambling about?

25
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,210
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,050
The fate of Kuntibhoj's daughter
is marked with misfortune.

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Such penance

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,140
exile

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,210
the death of her husband

30
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,000
and now this.

31
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,030
Your Majesty

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,010
Your Majesty, grief and agony
are choking my heart.

33
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,980
My heart breaks.

34
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,910
What news do you bring,
Prince of Gandhar?

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,910
News?

36
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,010
What news do you bring?

37
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,050
The news, great Bheeshma...

38
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,910
Soldier.

39
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,850
A hunter had gone to the woods
to hunt for game this morning.

40
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,000
There, inside the den of a tiger

41
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,810
he found these ornaments.

42
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,000
I fear

43
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,850
that these ornaments

44
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,070
belong to Prince Bheem!

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,910
Bheem!

46
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,040
Bheem!

47
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,850
Bheem... No.

48
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,970
Mother! - Mother!
- Mother!

49
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,940
Mother, what happened?

50
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,810
Mother? - Mother?
- Mother?

51
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,950
My son...

52
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,780
Bheem.

53
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,810
My...
My son cannot die.

54
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
Bheem.

55
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,740
Bheem.

56
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,750
Mother!
- Mother! - Mother.

57
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,880
'13 days later.'

58
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,870
Vidur.

59
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,910
I have seen the deaths
of my younger brothers.

60
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,780
First, the death of Pandu,
who was like a son and...

61
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,670
And now

62
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,770
the death of Pandu's son.

63
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,940
What has destiny
in store for me?

64
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,810
What has it decided?

65
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,840
God tests only
the competent, sire

66
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,780
Perhaps, to teach patience
to ordinary people.

67
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,840
The 'Brahmin' children are here,
great Bheeshma.

68
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,650
Sire, for the peace
of Bheem's soul

69
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,910
it is time for
the 'Brahmins' to be fed.

70
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,680
Let us proceed.

71
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,800
Enough of this, Kunti.

72
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,640
Bheem's...

73
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,840
Bheem's death

74
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,780
took place 13 days ago.

75
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,650
And you have been shedding
tears for the past 13 days.

76
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,610
Stop crying, Kunti.

77
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,640
Stopping my tears

78
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,740
cannot stop my weeping,
sister-in-law.

79
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,700
Your Highness, here you go.

80
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,770
One question

81
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,780
will keep agonizing me
for the rest of my life.

82
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,570
Why?

83
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,610
Why did my Bheem
go so far away from me?

84
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,740
Why?

85
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,770
Brother Bheem has
not gone anywhere, mother.

86
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,510
He will always be with us.
He will live in our hearts.

87
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,760
'Brahmins,' for the peace
of Kuru Prince Bheem's soul

88
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,880
do consume the food
that will be served to you

89
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,790
for which we shall be grateful.

90
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,750
Uncle.
- Yes.

91
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,780
What kind of a boy is he?

92
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,780
He eats so much.

93
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,590
I'm perplexed too, dear.

94
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,780
But we have
no other alternative.

95
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,850
Until all the young 'Brahmins'
are satiated

96
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,850
we must serve them food.

97
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,550
Arjun.

98
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,780
In order to serve food
to the 'Brahmins'

99
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,780
we must go to the courtyard.

100
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,750
If I feed
the young 'Brahmins' myself

101
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,750
then I will feel

102
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,650
as though...
As though I am

103
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,680
feeding my Bheem.

104
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,660
Your Highness,
we have a problem.

105
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,780
We are out of food
but there is a young 'Brahmin'

106
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,620
who is not yet satiated.

107
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,590
He is asking for more food.

108
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,490
Mother...

109
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,420
Mother, now I am satiated.

110
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,770
Bheem...

111
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,770
My son.

112
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Where had you gone?

113
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,840
I am Vasuki,
the King of Serpents.

114
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,640
My soldiers told me that you
put up quite a fight with them.

115
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,770
He was biting me.

116
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,570
Upon Pawan Dev's* request I had sent my soldiers to you
*Other name of Vayu, Pavana (the Purifier).

117
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,770
for your protection.

118
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,800
There was poison in your body

119
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,770
and in order
to cancel out its effect

120
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,640
I had sent my soldiers
to bite you.

121
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,730
Only poison can
nullify the effect of poison.

122
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,810
Could he not have told me that
before biting me?

123
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,680
We serpents are
of a furious nature.

124
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,670
But your ancestor, King Shuvasu

125
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,540
had married
the serpent woman Marisha.

126
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,680
The blood of serpents
runs through your veins.

127
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,580
That is why it is natural
for you to get angry.

128
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,810
I am not only short-tempered
but also very strong.

129
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,710
My serpents have experienced
your strength.

130
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,610
I am extremely pleased
with your courage and bravery.

131
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,610
No poison shall ever harm you.

132
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,670
Here you go.
Consume this.

133
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,540
With the help
of this special concoction

134
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
you will be blessed with
the strength of 100 elephants.

135
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,630
My blessings are with you.
