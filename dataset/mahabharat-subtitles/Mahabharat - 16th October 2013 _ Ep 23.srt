1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,540
Just like how the dark clouds
pour forth the rains

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,610
and cleanse themselves.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Just like how the water in the
rivers cleanses itself

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,700
by leaving the dirt aside
as it flows.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,740
In the same manner,
it is the duty of the king

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,600
to punish himself in order to
purify himself.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,730
How can I get rid of
my responsibilities?

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Atonement

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,800
is greater than justice
and punishment, Pandu.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,780
True atonement is one
in which

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,580
anything else in life
seems trivial in front of it.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
I understand

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,540
but I become frail thinking
of Hastinapur's future.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,670
Will this throne be
vacant again?

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,670
Even while shouldering the
responsibilities of the kingdom

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,540
you can live the life
of an ascetic.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,570
No, grandsire.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,680
If one builds his house
on a slope

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,570
he is bound to fall
into the ditch.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,570
If I live amidst this leisure

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,580
sooner or later I will forget
about my atonement

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,730
and get caught in the
worldly pleasures.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,710
How would you feel then,
grandsire?

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,470
When after 25 years
of struggle

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,680
you gave Hastinapur
a king

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,670
who is invariably
incapable?

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,630
I am the testimony to
your capability.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,470
I know there isn't anyone
more capable than you.

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,740
While in his last moments,
sage Kindam asked me a question

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,570
as to what kind
of a king was I.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,600
I couldn't distinguish between
a mystical deer and a human!

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,480
This question of his is
haunting me, grandsire.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,670
We kept brother away
from the throne

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,630
stating that he's
incomplete.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,600
But as a king

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,470
what sort of completeness
have I established?

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,470
I supplicate before you

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,610
let me go live in
the forest.

39
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,530
Let me fulfil my punishment

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,570
and improve my karma.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,630
May God bless you.

42
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,510
To improve karma

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,480
is important for a human being,
Your Highness.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,430
When one's soul
burns in hell

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,630
the pain is just unbearable.

46
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,460
Hence

47
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,500
to atone for one's sins,
during one's lifetime

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,410
is a good deed.
- Stop rambling, Shakuni.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,440
I am not rambling,
Your Highness.

50
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,570
I am not rambling.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,540
If I was in the place of
King Pandu

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,470
then I too would have
done the same.

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,410
I would have taken
the Lord's name

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,440
and spent the rest of my
life doing penance.

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,480
And I would have
permitted you too.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
But I cannot permit Pandu to
go live in the forest.

57
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,440
He is my brother.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,430
The very thought of him
living a difficult life

59
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,570
makes me shiver.

60
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,340
Difficult!
Difficult!

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,600
You, in true sense, are
generous, Your Highness.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,310
You're generous.
For real, my sister

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,470
is blessed to have you.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,440
She is very lucky.

65
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,370
Just like how

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,540
on a lotus leaf

67
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,430
a drop of water
cannot hold on.

68
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,400
In the same manner

69
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,530
sin

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,300
crime

71
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
temptation

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,530
greed

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,370
cannot hold on to
your pure heart.

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,530
Why are you changing
the topic, Shakuni?

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,410
What does my heart
have to do with this?

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
For me this is what is
important, Your Highness.

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,470
The brother

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,410
who deceitfully

79
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,500
dethroned you...

80
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,460
The one who

81
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,410
amidst the entire
royal assembly

82
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,530
had you humiliated...

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
But yet towards
the very same person

84
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,470
you have so much affection
within you.

85
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,370
You instead of

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,430
being worried of the future
of your unborn son

87
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,240
are worried about the
pain of your

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,380
deceitful brother.

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,330
You are great, Your Highness.

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,240
You are great.

91
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,430
Brother Shakuni!

92
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,370
Sister Gandhari!

93
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,300
The use of words

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,240
should be used as
a medication

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
so it can heal the pain
of one's heart.

96
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,240
But to use those words
to trigger the pain

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,330
is not right.

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,400
Wonderful, Gandhari.

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,340
Wonderful!

100
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,210
After marriage,
a girl turns into a woman

101
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,270
and becomes capable of giving
advice to her brother

102
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,430
is what I had always heard.

103
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,370
But I'm seeing it for the
first time today.

104
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,270
I'm not giving you
any advice.

105
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,380
I'm requesting, brother Shakuni.

106
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,170
Don't do anything to
divide my family.

107
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm not trying to divide,
sister Gandhari.

108
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm not trying to divide.

109
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,300
May Lord Yama claim
my life, if I'm doing so.

110
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm showing His Highness
the right path.

111
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,280
You have blindfolded yourself.

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,170
Your marital commitment
is unbelievable.

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,370
But

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,440
to inform His Highness about
the ditches in the path

115
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
has to be done by
someone after all.

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,180
Brother Shakuni...
- Hear me out!

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,240
His Highness
will be the one to decide

118
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,310
as to what's right
and what's wrong.

119
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,210
After King Pandu

120
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,140
Hastinapur's throne

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,300
shall see your son
as the king.

122
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,300
This is the least hope

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,210
His Highness
might be having.

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,240
So when the time comes

125
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,300
will King Pandu,
for the sake of your son

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,170
abdicate his authority?

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,240
Will he do a deed
as great?

128
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,180
Greatness! No!
No.

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,310
Had he such greatness
in his heart

130
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,330
would he have

131
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,100
been deceitful towards
his elder brother?

132
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,270
When destiny has played its game

133
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,100
and King Pandu,
of his own will

134
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,140
is abdicating
the throne of Hastinapur

135
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,170
then who are we,
mere humans

136
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,210
to disrupt the plot of destiny?

137
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,070
I just had to say this.

138
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,200
The rest has to be thought over
by His Highness.

139
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,340
Good bye, Your Highness.

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,170
Lord

141
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,100
please tell Pandu to give up his
decision of going to exile.

142
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,000
Remain silent

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,040
and let me gauge the situation,
Gandhari.

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,660
What's the situation indeed for
us to accept a life in exile?

145
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,730
The sin of killing the sage
was unintentional, wasn't it?

146
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,790
This is not the punishment of
the sin, Madri

147
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,520
but of being unaware.

148
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,720
If a king starts committing
crimes unintentionally

149
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,750
justice and peace can
never prevail in the kingdom.

150
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,750
When you had asked me
to get the deer skin

151
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,760
I should have given that
a thought then.

152
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,530
That means the fault is mine

153
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,660
and I accept that.
Punish me for that

154
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,490
but how is it necessary for you
to bear the harshness of exile?

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,630
No, Madri. It's not your fault.

156
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,560
Asking something to a husband

157
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,760
can't be a fault. - Then who's
the one to be blamed for?

158
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
His Highness'?

159
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,490
The attempt of trying to fulfil
my wish

160
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,630
is a mistake, isn't it, sister?

161
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,650
I understand.
All too well.

162
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,600
Henceforth, His Highness will
always listen to you

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,730
and not me.
I promise you.

164
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,460
I didn't mean that, Madri.
- Don't find faults, Madri.

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,630
Try to accept that the mistake
has been made. - I do accept.

166
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,460
I have made a mistake

167
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,630
but the consequences will have
to be borne by our sons

168
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,690
who have not yet come
into this world.

169
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,560
If they take birth in the forest

170
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,620
they will be left wanting of
their right over the throne.

171
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,690
Madri, the ones who haven't
been born as of yet

172
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,690
why to plan for their future?

173
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,660
Whatever they will be
destined to

174
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,550
will be their fate.

175
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,460
I am a princess.

176
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,590
That my progeny would
be enthroned as ruler

177
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,650
is what I have been
taught since I was a mere child.

178
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,560
So I have the right to ponder
about their future.

179
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,590
In the Kuru lineage,
it's not right

180
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,460
but competence that has
the upper hand, Madri.

181
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,400
Will only your sons have that
competency

182
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,420
and not mine, sister? - You both
can never bear sons.

183
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,620
What do you mean by that, Lord?

184
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,550
'I curse you'

185
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,500
'if you ever try to establish
marital relations with a woman'

186
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,500
'or try any conjugal acts
with her then you shall die.'

187
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,450
This is the reason

188
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,360
why I have decided
to go into exile.

189
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,530
I'll also come along with you,
Lord.

190
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,560
No, Kunti. The harshness
of exile are not meant for you.

191
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,290
You both will stay here

192
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,350
in the palace.
- Without a husband

193
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,330
the palace seems
to be like a forest

194
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,290
but if the husband is beside one

195
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,490
then even the hut in a forest
equates a palace.

196
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,350
I still can't understand
the meaning of your decision

197
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,460
but if you've already taken
a decision

198
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,390
and sister is going with you

199
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,500
then I too shall come with you.

200
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,420
If sister's place
is by your side

201
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,290
then I share the same fate too.

202
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,260
I have come to Hastinapur
along with you

203
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,360
and I shall go along

204
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,520
wherever you take me.

205
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,520
It will be a place
devoid of amenities.

206
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,390
Only hard work would be
in your destiny.

207
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,260
The crime was done by
the three of us

208
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,450
so is the predicament
we are in

209
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,520
and thus will be the atonement
done by us.

210
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,230
Lord, please go ahead with the
arrangements for the journey.

211
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,290
Madri

212
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,360
you must get ready
for the journey.

213
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,910
Sorrow, anguish, planning
and projection...

214
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,710
My consciousness is far away
from every such thing.

215
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,840
Everything seems

216
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,850
befuddled to me.

217
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,670
Bhishma, I'm unable
to find a way out.

218
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,680
You are being hopeless
but in vain.

219
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
There's a reason behind
being dejected, Bhishma.

220
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,840
Do you see that boat?

221
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,740
Even the intense flow
of this river

222
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,820
can't drown this boat.

223
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,770
But even if a small hole
appears in this very boat

224
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,680
then the same boat will drown.

225
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,710
A similar hole

226
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,770
now gapes at us

227
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,780
whilst being in
the empire of Hastinapur.

228
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,810
If Pandu abdicates

229
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,650
then Hastinapur
will again become weak.

230
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,840
Weaker than before

231
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,670
because now
subjects will talk about it.

232
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,610
The rumours will be spread.

233
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,770
The subjects will be upset
see the king leaving.

234
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,710
And the kingdom where the
subjects are upset and disturbed

235
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,620
becomes very weak.

236
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,780
You are aware of it, Bhishma.

237
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I will

238
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,680
not let the throne
of Hastinapur stay vacant.

239
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,780
We shall declare Dhritarashtra
as the king.

240
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,810
But it's against
righteousness and tradition.

241
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,670
Dhritarashtra shall
not be coronated.

242
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,780
He will be a de facto king.

243
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,710
He won't be able to carry out the Rajsuya 'yajna'.*
*The king's inauguration sacrifice performed by the ancient kings who considered themselves powerful enough to be an emperor.

244
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,580
But he'll be able to mete out
justice and righteousness.

245
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,710
You are quite apt,
Bhishma.

246
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,550
In the future, any child
being born in the Kuru lineage

247
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,670
shall be coronated.

248
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,610
But, Bhishma, will
Dhritarashtra accede to this?

249
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,770
Your Highness!

250
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,550
Your Highness!

251
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,650
Your Highness!

252
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,650
Your Highness!

253
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,680
Your Highness!

254
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

255
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,510
Your Highness, forgive me.

256
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,670
I have made a big mistake,
Your Highness.

257
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,650
What happened, Shakuni?

258
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,480
Your Highness!

259
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,680
Your Highness

260
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,540
I told Bhishma

261
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,670
that the throne
offered up just as alms

262
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,680
won't be acceptable
to you.

263
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,540
I have made a big mistake,
Your Highness.

264
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,720
You are quite apt, Shakuni.

265
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,620
I don't consume
food partaken by others.

266
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,510
I don't accept
anything in charity.

267
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,740
Charity!

268
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,520
In know it, Your Highness.

269
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,640
Now I have started
to understand you

270
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,640
that's why, before anyone
could even think about

271
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,650
enthroning you

272
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,550
I diverted the topic.

273
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,480
But I thought about it,
Your Highness.

274
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,680
The king of Panchal may not
belong to the Bharat lineage

275
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,570
he at least hails from
the Chandra lineage.

276
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Then why don't we invite him

277
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,640
to manage our
kingdom of Hastinapur?

278
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,550
What are you
rambling about, Shakuni?

279
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,640
I can get you beheaded
for this thought.

280
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,570
But, Your Highness, someone has
to be the ruler, after all.

281
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,540
And your son is
still being nurtured

282
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,640
in my dearest
sister's womb.

283
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,610
He can't be coronated

284
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,520
until you become a king.

285
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:30,380
But you consider
your own kingdom

286
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,570
as a charity.

287
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,510
Pandu will have a son.

288
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,410
He will become the king.

289
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,570
Until then, the responsibilities
of the kingdom

290
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,380
shall be handled by Queen Mother
and grandsire, okay?

291
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,650
King Pandu can't have children,
Your Highness.

292
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
What?
- I have learnt

293
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,580
that sage Kindam has
cursed your brother.

294
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,370
If taken in this manner

295
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,540
this is not charity,
Your Highness.

296
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,540
If you are considering
it to be charity

297
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,540
then there's no other way out.

298
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,540
Attention!

299
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,350
His Excellency Bhishma
is arriving.

300
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,470
Greetings, grandsire.

301
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,410
May you have a long life.

302
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,310
Greetings, grandsire.

303
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,480
Greetings.

304
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,310
Dhritarashtra,
after Pandu's exile

305
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,310
the throne of Hastinapur
has become vacant.

306
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,420
It needs a king.

307
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,540
Dear, the council of ministers
has decided

308
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,440
that in Pandu's stead

309
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,540
you should be announced
the de facto king.

310
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,350
For the sake of
Hastinapur's welfare

311
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,450
you will have to shoulder
this responsibility

312
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,370
Dhritarashtra.
