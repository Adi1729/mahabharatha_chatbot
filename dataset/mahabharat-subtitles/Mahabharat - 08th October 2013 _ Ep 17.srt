1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,570
The son you are about to beget

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,620
would inherently possess

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,470
my energy and resplendence.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,620
Son?

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,680
'I, Sage Durvasa, grant
you a mantra'

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,550
'by which you can invoke
any demigod'

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,570
'and summon him to you.'

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,570
'You would be able to beget
a son as glorious as him.'

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,720
But, Lord... I...

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,560
I haven't been married yet.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,560
How can I beget a son?

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,710
Then why did you
invoke me, Kunti?

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,510
I committed a folly, Lord.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,490
The consequences of the folly
will be borne by you, Kunti.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,750
You will surely beget a son.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,600
Sage Durvasa's curse
has no remedy

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,750
and neither can his boon
be any less bountiful.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,630
As soon as I disappear,
a portion of my energy

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,640
will stay back with you
in the form of a baby.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,730
I can't stop it from
happening, Kunti.

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,610
But what is my father's fault
in this, Lord?

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,540
He would be equally defamed.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,640
It would be widely known

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,740
that King Kuntibhoj's
daughter's character

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,500
is unchaste.

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,660
On top of that,
it would also be said

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,520
that if a Princess

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,480
could beget a son
before being married

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,610
then everyone else could.

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,580
No one would believe
that it was all due to a boon.

31
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,490
I understand
your quandary, Kunti.

32
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,640
This son of yours
is a result of a boon.

33
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,560
I also give you another boon

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,750
that even after giving birth
to a son

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,570
you will stay a maiden.

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,690
Your character will
remain pure and pious.

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,630
Accept this boon earnestly.

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,520
Surya dev so gaye chhaya andhera
(Lord of the sun has slept, and shades are darkened)

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,030
Chup chaap ye gagan so gayi hain dhara
(Slowly the heaven sleeps, and earth as well)

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,550
Tu bhi so jaa laal mere
(You are asleep as well, my child)

41
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,180
Kehana na maa ka tu taal re
(Don't let your mother words' go by)

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,270
So jaa mere laal re
(Sleep, my light)

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:23,390
So jaa mere laal re
(Sleep, my child)

44
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:42,320
Hmm…hmm...laa...laa...

45
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,800
Tu hriday ka mere, tukraa hai
(You are part of my heart)

46
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,800
Mere naina ka hai tu taara...
(and star in my eyes)

47
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,770
Meri bhul kshama kr laal mere
(Forgive my fault)

48
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,060
Mera pyaar, tu mera dulaara..
(My dear, you are my child)

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Godi meri, mamtaa tarpe
(in my lap, my love has died)

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,850
Maa bhi baas hai laachaari ha
(nothing left but helplessness)

51
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,150
So jaa mere laal re
(Sleep, my light)

52
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,780
So jaa mere laal re
(Sleep, my child)

53
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:51,210
Surya dev so gaye chhaya andhera
(Lord of the sun has slept, and shades are darkened)

54
00:04:51,950 --> 00:05:00,910
Chup chaap ye gagan so gayi hain dhara
(Slowly the heaven sleeps, and earth as well)

55
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:09,690
So jaa mere laal re
(Sleep, my light)

56
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,270
So jaa mere laal re
(Sleep, my child)

57
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,490
Please forgive me, son.

58
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,550
I'm helpless.

59
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
Due to my selfish reasons

60
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,550
I can't let my father

61
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,570
be ridiculed by all.

62
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,470
Please forgive me!

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,510
Lord Surya

64
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,530
please protect your son.

65
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,470
Don't worry about my son, Kunti.

66
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,740
He is in my sanctuary now.

67
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,490
I have provided him with
a divine armour and earrings.

68
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,680
No power in the universe
can pierce this armour of his.

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,620
The gilded sheen of his earrings

70
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,540
will shatter the darkness of his
life and be a guiding beacon.

71
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,510
My son will be
indomitable, Kunti.

72
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,600
He will be known all over
the world as Karna!

73
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,530
Karna!

74
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,740
My son!

75
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,490
My son...

76
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,700
No!

77
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,650
It's best to forget
the past, Princess.

78
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,560
Reminiscing the past

79
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,520
will cause dark clouds akin to
these to loom over your life.

80
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,590
Shall I forget?

81
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,560
How do I just forget,
Priyamvada?

82
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,730
Forsaking one's progeny

83
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,620
doesn't make him the past.

84
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,580
My son...

85
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,740
My son still lives
somewhere.

86
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,500
And till the time he draws
breath

87
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,550
he is my present.

88
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,570
But keeping this matter
a secret is best, Princess.

89
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,470
But from whom?

90
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,530
From the one who
would be my husband?

91
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,750
No, Priyamvada.

92
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,660
Just like flowing water
can't serve as a founding stone

93
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,480
in the very same way

94
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,480
life can't subsist on lies.

95
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,760
But, Princess

96
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,540
after knowing of this truth,
who will agree to marry you?

97
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,730
There must be someone...

98
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,570
There must be someone
for whom

99
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,520
my identity
isn't defined by my folly.

100
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,620
There must be someone

101
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,730
who will

102
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,630
accept me
along with my past.

103
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,760
There must be someone.

104
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,400
Greetings, sister-in-law.

105
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,410
You are welcome,
Your Highness!

106
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,450
You weren't disturbed, were you?

107
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,290
Before setting out for
the task at Kuntibhoj

108
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,320
I have come to
seek your blessings.

109
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,330
May you always be victorious,
Your Highness.

110
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,390
May your fame and glory
have no limits.

111
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,300
May you be successful
in every endeavour.

112
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,520
Can't you address me
just as Pandu, sister-in-law?

113
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,440
Addressing a king by his name
is a crime, Your Highness.

114
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,340
But the term 'Your Highness'
coming from you

115
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,500
pierces me like
a thousand thorns!

116
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,300
My heart brims over
with a feeling of guilt!

117
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,480
This throne belonged
to elder brother

118
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,540
and it is...
- No!

119
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,290
Had the throne been
your brother's

120
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,450
it'd have been his.

121
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,390
Since it wasn't so, it clearly
means, the throne is yours.

122
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,460
That was destiny.

123
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,290
Now, you have to become
worthy of the throne.

124
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,360
You had come here to become
the Empress and... - No!

125
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,420
I had come here to become
the wife of your elder brother

126
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,550
and that I am.

127
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,500
Had I come to become
the Empress

128
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,260
I would have married
the throne itself.

129
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,450
How can you be so benevolent?

130
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,550
Because a sister-in-law is
tantamount to a mother

131
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,360
Your Highness.

132
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,270
A mother has just one desire.

133
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,470
That her son
should get everything.

134
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,370
That he should achieve
all the pleasures of the world.

135
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,430
I feel, as if not just a 100

136
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,300
but I have the boon
to have 102 sons.

137
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,450
Promise me, sister-in-law

138
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,440
that when I am seated
on the throne

139
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,430
then and only at that time

140
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,430
would you address me
as 'Your Highness'.

141
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,410
Else, you'd consider me a son
and call me by my name.

142
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,390
Then not just you

143
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,500
but I would call your wife
by her name too.

144
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,540
Now, make haste to
reach Kuntibhoj

145
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,310
and get me my sister-in-law.

146
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,500
I have not laid eyes on you

147
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,350
but I can affirm that no
beautiful damsel of the world

148
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,550
would ever refuse
to be your wife.

149
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,270
Your blessings adorn my luck

150
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,550
which is why I feel confident

151
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,520
but without seeking
brother's blessings

152
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,300
I never start on any task.

153
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,400
This blessing is also on
his behalf, Pandu.

154
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,420
His heart is still
in a state of turmoil.

155
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,330
But he still loves you
as much as he used to.

156
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,330
I believe that, sister-in-law.

157
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,380
My adoration for him
is still the same.

158
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,340
I promise you

159
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,350
my wife and I

160
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,360
would always serve
you and elder brother

161
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,450
till the very end of our lives.

162
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,450
May you be victorious!

163
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,520
My respects to you,
sister-in-law.

164
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,360
My respects too.

165
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,280
The kings and princes
of the Arya region

166
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,420
by gracing the 'swayamvar' of
my daughter Kunti

167
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,440
you have indeed added
to my honour.

168
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,290
It has been the grand
tradition of the Arya region

169
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,350
that a maiden
is given the paramount right

170
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,420
to select her husband.

171
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,320
I request

172
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,340
that the decision
of my daughter Kunti

173
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,360
be heartily accepted by you

174
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,260
regardless of your being
enemies or allies.

175
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,350
You would offer the newlyweds
your blessings

176
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,480
and best wishes.

177
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,380
Come, daughter.

178
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,510
Today, I would
introduce you not to kings

179
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,450
as today, you would
be choosing your fate.

180
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,390
Father, before taking a decision

181
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,330
I would like to ask a question
to all the young men here.

182
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,540
My decision

183
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,280
will be based on the answer
to the same.

184
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,340
Only if you permit me.
- Sure.

185
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,380
In a 'swayamvar',
every maiden

186
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,390
has the right to ask questions
to the kings.

187
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,450
Attending kings and princes

188
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,390
my daughter wishes to clarify
a doubt she has.

189
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,520
The one whose answer
will be deemed most fit by her

190
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,400
will become
my daughter's husband.

191
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,500
I hope no one has any objection.

192
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,370
Prince Ashwakumar may have one,
Your Highness!

193
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,420
Whenever a question about
intelligence crops up

194
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,460
the princes of the Ashwa clan
aren't in the same league as us.

195
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,740
Please don't overstep the maxims
laid out for a 'swayamvar'.

196
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,920
A test of strength isn't
displayed at a court

197
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,920
but in battle.

198
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,770
Who are you?
- I am Hastinapur's Emperor

199
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,030
a son of the Kuru clan...
Pandu.

200
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,960
I beseech you both

201
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,810
to please return to your seats.

202
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,980
I request you to ask
your question.

203
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,890
My question goes thus...

204
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,920
Sage Gautam's wife Ahilya

205
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,930
had had a conjugal relationship
with Lord Indra.

206
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,770
Sage Gautam had punished
his wife.

207
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,840
Then why did Lord Ram

208
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,810
free Ahilya from the same?

209
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,760
By forgiving her mistake,
didn't Lord Ram

210
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,810
set the wrong example
for generations to follow?

211
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,720
The answer to this
is very simple.

212
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,800
The Lord is known
as The Benevolent One.

213
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,930
He can forgive
any sinner.

214
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,800
Then why weren't Bali
and Ravan forgiven?

215
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,840
That's discrimination.

216
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,820
Then why don't you answer
the same?

217
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,980
The answer is...

218
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,780
Every punishment has
its extremes.

219
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,790
Perhaps the Lord
would have felt

220
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,730
that it was time
Ahilya was freed.

221
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,960
But as per me,
the petrified Ahilya

222
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,920
would have repented
for her sins.

223
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,860
No!

224
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,000
The truth is that Lord Indra
had appeared before Ahilya

225
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,940
in the guise
of Sage Gautam.

226
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,970
The conjugal relationship
Ahilya established

227
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,920
was only due to the knowledge
that she was with her husband.

228
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,880
Sage Gautam had cursed
her in a fit of rage

229
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,820
but Lord Ram
was a king.

230
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,870
And a king, before
announcing a sentence

231
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,820
has to mandatorily know

232
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,870
if the punishable deed
is a crime or a folly.

233
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,760
If the intentions aren't wrong
or the nous is pure

234
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,910
repentance and atonement
alone suffice.

235
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,980
There's no need for punishment.

236
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,960
Thinking the same

237
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Lord Ram must have
forgiven Ahilya.
