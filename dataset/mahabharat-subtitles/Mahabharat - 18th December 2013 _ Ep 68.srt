1
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,290
Subhadra!

2
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,260
Brother, are you alright?

3
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,520
Why wouldn't I be, Subhadra?

4
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,450
It was you who was drowning.

5
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,260
You've forgotten your brothers

6
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,330
and stayed for so long
in Hastinapur.

7
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,420
I was afraid, Hastinapur had
become your in-laws' place.

8
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,260
Brother!

9
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,380
You are the apple
of my eyes, Subhadra.

10
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,320
Food tastes bland without you.

11
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,350
So, tell me.
Are you happy?

12
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,390
How can I be happy, brother?

13
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,220
I was terrorized
by that demon Kalyavan.

14
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,490
And brother,
I was so worried for you.

15
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,250
When you are worried,
you should meditate, Subhadra.

16
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,420
It helps immensely.

17
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,460
Besides, when one's
protector is Arjun

18
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,190
one need not worry at all.

19
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,220
Krishna!

20
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,190
No one can protect you from me!

21
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,330
Look, Kalyavan
is approaching us!

22
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,280
The other term for 'kaal'
is death, Arjun.

23
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,350
There is not a moment when
death doesn't approach a person.

24
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,250
Why worry about it, Arjun?

25
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,220
But

26
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,180
one must find time to
talk to one's loved ones.

27
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,120
So, tell me, Subhadra.
How is aunt?

28
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,280
I hope, she is well.

29
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,260
My heart yearns
to seek her blessings.

30
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,120
If you wish to stay alive
to seek her blessings

31
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,090
then draw your weapon, Vasudev!

32
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,320
Neither can my Sudarshan Chakra
nor your arrows kill him.

33
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,090
He can be slain only by
the fire of a sage's wrath.

34
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,280
So, what do we do now?

35
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,350
We shall run away.

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,150
Stop, Krishna! Why are you
fleeing like a coward?

37
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,320
Face your doom!

38
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,150
Stop, coward!

39
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,130
Shepherd, stop!

40
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,280
Stop and face your death!

41
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,020
How can you flee the battlefield
when death approaches you?

42
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,180
The future generations

43
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,290
will call you Ranchhod* and laugh at you!
*One who leaves the war area or battlefield, another name for Shri Krishna, when he left the battlefield in war with Jarasandh so that Mathura could be saved from destruction, he then went to Dwaraka.

44
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,020
I know.
The future generations

45
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,250
will refer to me by the name
of Ranchhod as well.

46
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,080
And for that,
I am grateful to you.

47
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,090
Now, quit talking and attack.

48
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,220
Krishna!

49
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,250
You said, your brother Krishna
is a courageous person.

50
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,050
Then why is he running away
in this manner?

51
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,030
You'll never understand my
brother Krishna, Prince Arjun.

52
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,250
He must certainly have
a plan in his mind.

53
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,220
Courageous men
have only one plan

54
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,090
to defeat the enemy.

55
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,250
And here, I don't see
Kalyavan getting defeated.

56
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,210
Kalyavan.

57
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,220
Hey!

58
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,960
Hey, shepherd!
Stop!

59
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,930
Where are you hiding?

60
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,160
Krishna!

61
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,980
Show yourself!

62
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,080
Krishna!

63
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,890
Where are you hiding?

64
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,950
Krishna!

65
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,960
Instead of fighting me

66
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,110
he is sleeping here.

67
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,990
Wake up, coward!

68
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,050
Wake up!

69
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,980
Wake up!

70
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,920
Wake up!

71
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Wake up!

72
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,670
Do accept my greetings,
great sage Muchukund.

73
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,670
I have grown up hearing
the stories of your valour.

74
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Who was that

75
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,530
who, without any reason

76
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,440
got burnt to ashes by me?

77
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,510
Nothing happens in this world
without a reason, great sage.

78
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,700
Perhaps

79
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,470
getting burnt by you

80
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,530
was his destiny.

81
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,640
And in order to
reduce him to ashes

82
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
maybe the Almighty
had motivated you

83
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
to leave your kingdom
and meditate here.

84
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,570
Who can ever know?

85
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,600
But do pardon me for interfering
with your meditation.

86
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,410
Now, you need not fret
and can resume your meditation.

87
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Are you happy now, Arjun?

88
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,370
Greetings, Vasudev.

89
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,410
No.

90
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,340
You need not seek my blessings

91
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,570
because you have
a place in my heart.

92
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,510
Didn't I tell you, Prince Arjun?

93
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,480
My brother must have
indeed had a plan.

94
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,530
How did you achieve this,
Vasudev?

95
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,470
How I achieved it?

96
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,470
Arjun, do you know
about King Mandhata

97
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,540
and his son, King Muchukund?

98
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,540
Yes. He fought battles
all his life

99
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,440
and had conquered
the entire world.

100
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,510
And then he gave up his kingdom
in order to rest.

101
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,540
Yes, Arjun.

102
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,340
That person is indeed
praiseworthy who realizes that

103
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,410
worldliness is labour
and meditation

104
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,410
is the only form of rest.

105
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,430
Most people deem

106
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,310
worldliness to be happiness
and keep tiring themselves

107
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,430
but they do not even
think about resting.

108
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,300
For years

109
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,310
great sage Muchukund has been
meditating in that cave.

110
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,410
He had not opened his eyes
for 100 years.

111
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,410
All this meditation had
garnered him so much power

112
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,370
that when he would open
his eyes after all this while

113
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,500
the first person he would
lay his eyes upon would

114
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,400
be reduced to ashes.

115
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,500
Kalyavan was destined
to die this way.

116
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,540
I merely brought
the various forces together.

117
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,430
That's it.

118
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,200
Arjun

119
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,330
you should come to Dwaraka.

120
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,430
I have to talk to you
about so many things.

121
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,310
I have heard so much
about your might!

122
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,330
The migrants
from Hastinapur said

123
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,410
that you had constructed
a canopy of arrows

124
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,470
to protect yourself
from the roof collapsing on you.

125
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,340
And you even defeated
King Drupad.

126
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,370
I could do so only because
of your help, Vasudev.

127
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,470
The stones that you gifted me

128
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,240
had eyes on them and because
of them I could figure out

129
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,240
as to who the real Drupad was.

130
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,280
The one who didn't
have restless eyes.

131
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
Wonderful, Arjun!

132
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
You discovered such deep meaning
from those stones?

133
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,240
In other words,
that's not the reason

134
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,330
why you sent me those stones?
- Not at all.

135
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,340
Those five stones represented
you and your brothers.

136
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,380
I liked them and hence,
I sent them as a gift.

137
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,380
Prince Arjun,
don't believe my brother

138
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,210
because what he does and what
he says never mean the same.

139
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,330
Subhadra

140
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,230
the intelligence of a man
and the situation he is in

141
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,310
helps him understand things.

142
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,120
When it rains, a Peacock dances
but the Common Hawk-Cuckoo

143
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,240
cries.

144
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,230
The true meaning
of what a person says

145
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,170
can be understood
only by an intelligent person.

146
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,270
No wonder people
misunderstand each other.

147
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,330
But Subhadra

148
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,240
do you feel no shame
in talking of your brother so?

149
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,340
If people hear you,
they will say I lie.

150
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,250
'North-West, North,
North-East, East.'

151
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,030
'Dwaraka.'

152
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Haven't you established
this kingdom, Vasudev?

153
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,990
It has prospered so much
in so little time.

154
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,120
No, Arjun.

155
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,060
I have not established
this kingdom.

156
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,190
The Yadavas have
worked hard to establish it.

157
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,020
I have merely used
my intelligence

158
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,920
to guide them.

159
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,960
The entire region of Arya knows

160
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,060
that you have
established Dwaraka.

161
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,050
And you say,
you have done nothing?

162
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,020
I am not lying, Arjun.

163
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,030
The truth is, I

164
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,150
do nothing.

165
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,930
And the one who realizes
that he does nothing himself

166
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,990
only he can achieve
an important feat.

167
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Brother!

168
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,890
Won't you come
to the city with us?

169
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,040
Will you finish your entire
conversation right here?

170
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,180
Subhadra, I'll be there.

171
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,780
You should take Arjun
to the city.

172
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,580
I

173
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,820
need to leave to execute
an exceedingly important task.

174
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,960
But I shall return soon.

175
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,820
Vasudev

176
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
if you don't mind

177
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,940
then may I accompany you?

178
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,820
You wish to come along?

179
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,960
In fact, Arjun, you will help me
a great deal by accompanying me.

180
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,880
Just give me the order.

181
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,860
But do remember, Arjun.

182
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,020
This task will be exceedingly
difficult for you.

183
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,060
The truth is, this task will be
quite gruesome for you.
