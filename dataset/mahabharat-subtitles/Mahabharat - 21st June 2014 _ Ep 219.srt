1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,950
In this war whoever
is a hurdle to punishing

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,930
the sons of Dhritarashtra

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,990
must be slain!

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,870
Perhaps slaying Grandsire
isn't inevitable, Krishna.

5
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,040
Today he disarmed our eldest brother

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,110
but did not slay him.

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,910
Therefore, in this battle of justice

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,960
even Grandsire hopes for our victory.

9
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,960
And until he does not
interfere in our path to victory

10
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,060
slaying him isn't inevitable.

11
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,910
And just like today
even tomorrow

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,040
we shall reach Prince Duryodhan.

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,880
It's not just battles, Arjun

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,990
but every moment of life
gives us new experiences.

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,960
Those who plan based on past
experiences are disappointed.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,040
If Grandsire's situations
and thoughts undergo a change

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,080
we should not face disappointment.

18
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,840
Greetings, Grandsire!

19
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,870
If you feel well, shall we

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,980
decide about strategies
for tomorrow.

21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,050
With the help of a miracle

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,050
a person may

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,000
perhaps keep a lamp's flame lit
and stable amidst strong wind.

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,030
But if the wick of the lamp is dampened

25
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,930
its flame cannot be kept lit and stable.

26
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,110
Even the wick of my soul
is drenched with tears.

27
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,920
The very Yudhishtir, to see whom

28
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,900
upon the throne of Hastinapur

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,100
I enslaved myself to the
throne of Hastinapur forever

30
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,840
today...

31
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,980
Today I had to enslave
that Yudhishtir himself.

32
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,910
How can I feel well, Master Drona

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,080
in this battlefield?

34
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,010
But...

35
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,870
But battle plans and strategies
need to be discussed.

36
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,000
Have a seat.

37
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,040
What is your advice, Master Drona?

38
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,980
There exists a very
common battle formation.

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,920
Garland formation!

40
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,980
With this we can distribute
our army into smaller clusters

41
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,020
and make an attack.

42
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,020
No, Master Drona!

43
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,090
With this battle formation

44
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,940
we cannot supervise the activity
of the entire army.

45
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Ought to this

46
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,070
either one of the sons
of Dhritarashtra may die

47
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,850
or one of the sons of Pandu could die.

48
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,980
Until my last breath I cannot bear

49
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,920
the burden of the death of
my children and grandchildren.

50
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,090
Therefore, today
on the battlefield

51
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,090
I captivated Yudhishtir.

52
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,970
I did not slay him.

53
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,070
I could not slay him,
Master Drona.

54
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,910
I could not.

55
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,110
In this battle

56
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,960
I have a single goal, Master Drona.

57
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,060
I cannot let anyone
among the Kuru clan die.

58
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,100
We must soon arrest Yudhishtir

59
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,040
and put an end to this war!

60
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,050
Prince!

61
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,830
What is the motive behind
summoning all these warriors?

62
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,940
Dear friend Karna, brace yourself.

63
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,840
Tomorrow at dawn you shall
be present at the battlefield

64
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,850
and exhibit your skill!

65
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,920
I believe you

66
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,860
won't break my trust.

67
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,090
My lad...
- Be quiet!

68
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,990
Be quiet, uncle!

69
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,130
Your advice has already
caused me enough damage!

70
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,980
It was your advice to yield to
Grandsire Bheeshma's insistence

71
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,010
and not to let my friend
Karna enter the battlefield.

72
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,980
What was the result of that?

73
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,990
Today you may have witnessed

74
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,080
that Grandsire Bheeshma stays
at the midst of our army

75
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,950
but fights on behalf of the enemy!

76
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,960
Prince, had you and your brothers

77
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,110
not been under my protection

78
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,910
all of you would perish
on the very first day of battle.

79
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,080
Honour is worthier than one's life.

80
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,060
And honour is measured
by trust, Grandsire.

81
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,050
You have broken my trust

82
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,090
and strangulated my honour!

83
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,090
You killed not just my honour

84
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,970
but the honour of all of Hastinapur.

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,950
You have brought shame upon
the name of King Shantanu!

86
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,960
Prince Duryodhan!

87
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Had I not sworn to protect you

88
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,900
I would slay you right now!

89
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,830
Then raise your weapon!

90
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,100
Let's engage in a duel,
Grandsire Bheeshma!

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,030
The embracer of justice
and the son of Ganga!

92
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,040
Let us test today

93
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,970
as to how mighty

94
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,850
these treacherous arms are!

95
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,030
He had the chance
to slay Yudhishtir!

96
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,870
But he did not do that!

97
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,070
Had you slain Yudhishtir

98
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,050
the battle would end today,
Grandsire!

99
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,920
Shame on you!

100
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
Friend Karna!

101
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,020
I order you
as the King of Hastinapur.

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,020
Tomorrow you shall
enter the battlefield!

103
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,840
You are aware of my
decision as well, Duryodhan.

104
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,150
If your friend Karna even steps
onto the battlefield tomorrow

105
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,920
I shall not fight this battle!

106
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,090
In that case, do no fight the battle.

107
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,940
Your presence on the battlefield
makes no difference to me.

108
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,900
In fact, if you are not
present on the battlefield

109
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,980
I shall attain victory
even more easily.

110
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,950
Now I do not need you.

111
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,910
Duryodhan!

112
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,980
A necklace is held worthy
only when it has pearls in it

113
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,880
and is assumed respectable too!

114
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,930
If a pearl falls off a
necklace it becomes worthless!

115
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,090
Master Drona,
before storming at me

116
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,030
think of what is just yourself!

117
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,130
Grandsire Bheeshma!

118
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,970
Even you better ponder upon your duties!

119
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,940
You have embraced the pride
of being just all your life!

120
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,980
Now tell me, where is your justice?

121
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,050
You had sworn to guard
the throne of Hastinapur!

122
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,990
If today, you renounce the battlefield

123
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,900
what about that oath of
yours, Grandsire Bheeshma?

124
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,880
'I will spend my life
not as the King of Hastinapur'

125
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,970
'but as a servant to it!'

126
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,920
'Until you are seated upon the
throne of Hastinapur as King'

127
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,910
'until then I shall be a
servant to you and Hastinapur'

128
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,930
'and abide by your every order!'

129
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,340
Yes, Grandsire Bheeshma!

130
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,270
Under any circumstance

131
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,300
you have no rights at all
to renounce the battlefield!

132
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,480
Whether my friend Karna fights or not

133
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,480
you shall have to fight this battle!

134
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,540
Yes, Grandsire Bheeshma!
Think deeply!

135
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,540
You are in a huge moral dilemma!

136
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,280
You decide, Grandsire

137
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
as to which one out of your two pledges

138
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,490
would you like to fulfill!

139
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,490
Will you defend Hastinapur

140
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,260
or renounce the battlefield upon

141
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,270
seeing Karna enter the battle?

142
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,530
Ponder over it, Grandsire.

143
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,340
Do you wish to renounce your duty

144
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,370
and perish like a pest
in the dirt

145
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,350
or embrace your duty

146
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,450
and justify your death?

147
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,530
My decision is my friend Karna...
- Wait, friend!

148
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,350
Do not insult Grandsire
in this manner.

149
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,510
I have utmost faith

150
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,350
that Grandsire shall
not break your trust.

151
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Let him fight the battle!

152
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,470
Moreover, I am always at your disposal

153
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,460
ready to lay down my life!

154
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,330
My lad!

155
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,340
The armoured one speaks wisely!

156
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,450
Duryodhan, my lad,
have mercy on Grandsire.

157
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,360
Any aged one's death should
not be meddled with, lad.

158
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,530
Very well, if you all insist

159
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,430
I can give him one chance.

160
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,340
But what shall I gain from it?

161
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,450
I solemnly swear
that until my death

162
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,360
I shall not renounce the battlefield.

163
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,410
Every moment, I shall stand
on the battlefield.

164
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,440
The way ought to Lord Shiva's fiery 'Rudra Tandav'*
*A divine dance of Shiva that depicts his violent nature.

165
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,350
the entire world was
plunged into darkness

166
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,310
similarly

167
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,510
I will erase all hope of victory

168
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,520
from the enemy's heart!

169
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,430
I shall obliterate

170
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,490
the entire army of the enemy!

171
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,370
Why do the winds
seem so strong, Krishna?

172
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,270
These are the winds of change, Draupadi!

173
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Someone's circumstances
have undergone a change.

174
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,280
Mindsets have changed.

175
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,290
And now situations
shall change as well.

176
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Would this change

177
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,400
become the reason of
our sorrow, O' Krishna?

178
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,480
Change does not bring
about sorrow, good lady

179
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,450
but it does bring about pain.

180
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,510
Therefore a human
always fears change.

181
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,390
He tries to oppose it.

182
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,430
But, good lady

183
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,260
change is the law of nature!

184
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,430
And joy...

185
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,430
Joy is a product of creation.

186
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,440
That implies, no matter
what pain change cause to one

187
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,480
in the end he does find joy.

188
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,360
Some feel the joy of success

189
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,260
while some feel
the joy of liberation.

190
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,030
Grandsire!

191
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,100
What formation do we assume
for tomorrow's battle?

192
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,130
What is the strategy?

193
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,170
Strategy?

194
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,180
There is just one strategy,
Master Drona?

195
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,920
The strategy to unleash rivers of blood!

196
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,060
Tomorrow I shall be at the
forefront of the army

197
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,990
and unleash chaos!

198
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,070
Witnessing the agony in your heart

199
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,170
I feel immensely sad.

200
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,970
But Grandsire,
you are abiding by duty.

201
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,080
But when it is time
to abide by one's duty

202
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,180
that time it is inappropriate
to express any grief

203
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,190
nor any affection.

204
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,030
I know, Master Drona!

205
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,970
Living up to the promise
made to my father is my duty.

206
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,940
Tomorrow, at dawn when I
shall enter the battlefield

207
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,910
love, affection, sacrifice,
hatred, pain, sorrow...

208
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,950
I shall renounce all of these!

209
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,060
My hands shall wield a bow

210
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,190
and the burden of duty
shall be over my head.

211
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,060
This battlefield

212
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,940
shall devour all possibilities
of a just kingdom.

213
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,940
All lights of Hastinapur
shall be extinguished by me.

214
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,040
But I...

215
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,180
I shall not mourn for it, Master Drona!

216
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,990
Just one night!

217
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,970
All the sorrows in my heart

218
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,070
shall crush all my feelings

219
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,130
by the end of this night

220
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,110
and tomorrow, at dawn

221
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,950
I shall step
onto the battlefield

222
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,150
like a heartless beast

223
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,020
driven solely by thirst for blood!
