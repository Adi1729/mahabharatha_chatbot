1
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,520
You may speak first, friend.

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,520
Vasudev

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,560
I did not know

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,640
that you would
break your promise.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,800
I am not breaking my promise,
brother Duryodhan.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
You most certainly are,
Vasudev.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,120
When I had come here

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,880
your eyes were closed.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,160
And my eyes were closed

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,760
even when friend had come here.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,560
But he sat in a place

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,240
where I could
see him first.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
And it is the fault
of the Almighty

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,680
because He has placed

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,480
the eyes in front of the head.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
A person sitting at the back

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,000
cannot be said
to have arrived first.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,000
Vasudev

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,520
but all the seats

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,840
were placed behind your head.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,640
That is not my fault.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
If friend wanted

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
he too could have taken a seat.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,440
Pride seeks to occupy
the highest place

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,440
while love seeks to occupy
the correct one.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,880
I am not breaking my promise.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,000
Then coming to you

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,520
with the hope of justice
was futile.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,840
I am leaving now,
Vasudev.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Stop,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,960
You had come here to ask
for something from Madhav.

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,800
You cannot leave
without asking for it.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,920
That would tarnish
Madhav's reputation.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
Then what is the reason

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
that Vasudev has decided
to fulfill your wish first?

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,600
Because friend has come
with a request while you

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,680
have come with a plan.

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,240
Friend has dedication
in his heart while you

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,760
have politics in yours.

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
Friend seeks charity

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
while you require support.

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,240
If one gets the opportunity
to engage in charity

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
then one seeks
to fulfill it first.

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,080
No other task in the world

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,480
is more important than charity.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,200
This is partiality,
Vasudev.

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,720
No, brother.

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,520
I certainly am partial
towards the person

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,240
who forsakes the world
and chooses me.

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,720
However, I have
my brother's orders.

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,160
So, I cannot be partial today.

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Before asking for anything

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,600
listen to my decision.

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,680
In this war,
my army and I

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,880
will not fight
from the same side.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,960
My army will stand
against me in the battlefield.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,400
The Narayani Army of Dwaraka

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,560
is like no other in this world.

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,200
Each soldier of this one 'akshauhini'* army
*An ancient battle formation that consisted of 21,870 chariots (Sanskrit ratha); 21,870 elephants; 65,610 cavalry and 109,350 infantry.

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,280
battles like a 'Maharathi.'

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,280
He can use all known
weapons of the world.

62
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,480
Defeating this army

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,400
is nearly

64
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
impossible.

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
But Vasudev

66
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
your competence

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,080
is more than that
of your Narayani Army.

68
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,840
You are correct,
brother Duryodhan.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,960
The strength and power
of my Sudarshan 'Chakra'

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
can be matched
only by Mahadev's Trident

71
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,720
and Indra's 'Vajra.'

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
Its blow

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
scares not only humans

74
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,040
but also the Gods.

75
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
The strength of my knowledge

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
the might of my character

77
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,200
and the energy of my soul
reside in this weapon.

78
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,240
The moment I use
the Sudarshan 'Chakra'

79
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,760
there will be annihilation.

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Truth-untruth

81
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,040
justice-injustice

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
weak-powerful...

83
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,440
Everything will be destroyed.

84
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
In such a situation

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,520
the presence

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
or the absence of a war

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,680
makes no difference,
brother Duryodhan.

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,960
That is why,
I have taken the decision

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
that I shall

90
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,760
not take to arms in this war.

91
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
On one hand,
there is

92
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,480
my invincible one 'akshauhini'
Narayani Army

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
while on the other

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,440
there is me.

95
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,120
Alone

96
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
and weaponless.

97
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,320
Now, the decision rests
with the two of you.

98
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,640
Tell me,
friend.

99
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
What do you wish for?

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
Make the choice,
friend.

101
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,160
My choice is clear,
Madhav.

102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,440
However, to save your name from
being tainted with partiality

103
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,600
could you please give
the opportunity

104
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,480
to Crown Prince Duryodhan
to make the choice first?

105
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,400
Tainted!

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,040
When I was a child,
Mother Yashoda

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,640
used to call me 'Kala'.*
*Kaladeva, the black deity.

108
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,680
How can a dark person
be scared of getting tainted?

109
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,000
And it is quite evident

110
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,120
what brother Duryodhan
seems to have chosen.

111
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,080
The basis of choice
of some human beings

112
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,680
is often
the possibility of a benefit

113
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,480
while the basis of choice
of other human beings

114
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
is their nature.

115
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,800
And brother Duryodhan
knows quite well

116
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,600
where his benefits lie.

117
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,080
You do know, do you not,
brother Duryodhan?

118
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,480
I most certainly do.

119
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,520
That is why, I choose...
- No.

120
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
The first one to choose

121
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,280
will be friend.

122
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,640
You have earned
this right, friend.

123
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,680
Forsaking one's rights
is not called bravery.

124
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,880
Right?

125
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
One has the right
to one's property, Madhav.

126
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,520
Love

127
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,000
knowledge

128
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,400
and truth

129
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,000
have their right
on human beings.

130
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,720
You are the embodiment
of love, knowledge and truth.

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
You are righteousness yourself.

132
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,440
I cannot choose you.

133
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,900
I can only ask for you,
Madhav

134
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,900
but neither out of
the greed of victory

135
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,700
nor the fear of defeat.

136
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,060
For...

137
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,740
For the sake of righteousness

138
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,300
I ask for you,
Madhav.

139
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
I ask for you,
Madhav.

140
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,300
You

141
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,140
asked for a person

142
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
who has no army
or weapons, Arjun?

143
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,700
Is this generosity

144
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,660
or foolishness?

145
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,300
When the juice of sugarcane
has been extracted

146
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,980
only the juice is of value.

147
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,700
The sugarcane has no value,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.

148
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,300
You are correct,
Arjun.

149
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,940
Vasudev

150
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,300
your one 'akshauhini'

151
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,180
Narayani Army will have to
suffice me now.

152
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,020
Splendid, brother.

153
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,500
Brother had said

154
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,940
that neither him,
me

155
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,700
nor our army will fight
on behalf of the Pandavas.

156
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,060
His words did not go in vain

157
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,580
friend had his wish fulfilled

158
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,860
and even your plan
was successful.

159
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
Now,
we must see

160
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,300
who gets what

161
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,380
in this war.

162
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
Kunti

163
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,100
you must indeed have heard

164
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,300
that the Yadavas of Dwaraka

165
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,500
have decided to take
Duryodhan's side.

166
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,140
Only the army of Dwaraka

167
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,660
will battle along with that of
Hastinapur, brother-in-law.

168
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,580
Today, I am reminded
of my beloved Pandu.

169
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,940
Brother-in-law,
this is the time

170
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,100
when the heart

171
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,340
becomes agitated with
the uncertainties of the future.

172
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,900
At a time like this

173
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,180
one is reminded of the past.

174
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,100
Yes!
You are correct, Kunti.

175
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,980
My heart is full
of uncertainties.

176
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,540
This reminds me of an incident
from my childhood.

177
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,580
At that time,
Pandu

178
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,060
was about three-years-old.

179
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,380
One day, in order to keep
his gold toy safe

180
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,060
he placed it in my hands.

181
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,980
A person who has vision

182
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,100
has a different world than the
ones who are visionless, Kunti.

183
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,300
Even as a child,
I could not know

184
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,300
what a toy was.

185
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,260
I could not
take care of that toy.

186
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,580
It fell from my hands and broke.

187
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,700
Pandu cried a lot at that time.

188
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,260
Then I...

189
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,420
Then I took the pieces
of that broken toy

190
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,380
in my hands

191
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,420
and etched its shape
in my mind, Kunti.

192
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,220
After working hard all night

193
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,220
I made the exact same toy

194
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
out of wood and gave it to him.

195
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,380
His joy knew no bounds
that day, Kunti.

196
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,540
He went to everyone and said

197
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,420
that something
that belonged to him

198
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,020
would stay safe
only in my hands.

199
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,260
His joy and faith

200
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,500
had left me feeling
exceedingly happy, Kunti.

201
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,100
I decided right then

202
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,180
that anything
that belongs to Pandu

203
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,900
will not be harmed
as long as I am alive.

204
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,060
But today,
I feel sad

205
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,180
that despite my presence,
I could not keep Pandu's sons

206
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
safe from all this.

207
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,740
That is why,
I request you, Kunti

208
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,820
to explain to your sons

209
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,220
to quit being
intransigent about a war

210
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,940
and dedicate themselves to us.

211
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,580
If they die

212
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,220
then my heart will break,
Kunti.

213
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,420
You need not worry,
brother-in-law.

214
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,940
The Almighty himself
has come up with a plan

215
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,820
to keep my sons safe.

216
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,460
They will not be harmed.

217
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,180
Krishna is with them.

218
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,660
Do you not remember,
brother-in-law?

219
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,700
Your sons had tried

220
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,140
to disrobe Draupadi
in the court.

221
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,860
Krishna had left the entire
court bare on its account.

222
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,940
However

223
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,100
he did not let Draupadi
get disrobed.

224
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,580
Krishna is Narayan himself.

225
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,700
The side he is on

226
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,180
is the one that will
emerge victorious.

227
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,140
Kunti...

228
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,620
But Vasudev has decided

229
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,420
not to take to arms
in the battlefield, Kunti.

230
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,860
In such a situation,
how will he aid your sons?

231
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,180
Krishna does not aid anyone,
brother-in-law.

232
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,980
The side he is on

233
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,900
gets aided by
the entire creation itself.

234
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,180
In the battlefield,
all of Arjun's arrows

235
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
will transform into
the 'Brahmastra'

236
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,100
because he will be

237
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,460
aided by Krishna's powers.

238
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,220
Bheem's mace will strike
like the 'Vajra.'

239
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,260
The weapons of Yudhishthir,
Nakul and Sahadev

240
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,460
will wreak havoc on your army

241
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,940
like lighting burns a tree down.

242
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,220
You had once promised
My Lord to keep him safe.

243
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,580
That is why,
today

244
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,700
I have lit these hundred lamps.

245
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,060
I have made an attempt
to keep your sons safe.

246
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,900
When these lamps
almost get extinguished

247
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,620
you will know

248
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,020
that the lives of your sons
are in danger.

249
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,540
Krishna being on their side

250
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,620
will take my sons to victory.
