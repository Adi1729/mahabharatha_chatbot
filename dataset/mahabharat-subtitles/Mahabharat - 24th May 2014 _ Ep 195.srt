1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,670
He too has a heart.

2
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,500
I've closely

3
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,620
watched him
strive over the years.

4
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,620
He knows

5
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,560
that the path

6
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,660
he's headed on

7
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,490
isn't just or right.

8
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,520
If we succeed in persuading him

9
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,550
then we could awaken
his conscience.

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,550
No, aunt.

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,490
No.

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,660
Only once
he experiences awakening

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,530
we'll be able to persuade him.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,500
And

15
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,430
you'll have to do it.

16
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,530
Me!

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,460
How would I do it?

18
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,430
I tried to tell him
a lot of times

19
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,630
that he's my son.

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,360
I either couldn't find
propitious time

21
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,360
or a circumstance to express it.

22
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,470
How would I face him now?

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,550
How will I

24
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,560
persuade him?

25
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,350
Krishna

26
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,460
you're omniscient.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,490
You are compassionate
towards everyone.

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,360
Only you can forgive me.

29
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,530
And...

30
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,400
Ask for forgiveness
on my behalf.

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Once...

32
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,330
For once, request

33
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,430
him to do what is right.

34
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,390
Just once.

35
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,350
One who favours righteousness

36
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,560
is always favoured.

37
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,290
I can only remind

38
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,430
Karna of what's right, aunt.

39
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,290
Since you've asked me

40
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,460
I'll certainly make a request.

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,390
Greetings!

42
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,450
Greetings!

43
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,400
Karna is addressed as Radheya
by the whole of Arya clan

44
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,260
because of you.

45
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,320
I salute you for inculcating

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,260
righteousness in Karna.

47
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,420
I've failed

48
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,330
since my son's endorsing
the ones who are unjust.

49
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,260
My son was a pure soul.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,260
I don't know
why is he defending the evil.

51
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,420
Perhaps he isn't aware

52
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,360
as to who he is.

53
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,160
You're here to meet Karna

54
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,290
but he doesn't stay here.

55
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,330
He stays in the palace, Krishna.

56
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,160
I know.

57
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,320
I also know

58
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,370
that he'll certainly
come here today.

59
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,220
Like a bird seeks shelter
in a tree

60
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,190
to find solace
away from the Sun.

61
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,260
If he's tired of standing
by injustice

62
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,160
he'd come here.

63
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,270
His family has treasured
righteousness as legacy for him.

64
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,260
Karna, your destiny
is an accumulation

65
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,160
of all your decisions.

66
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,170
One decision
can alter your destiny.

67
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,360
It can transform the future.

68
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,330
Decisions are derived
out of human perspective.

69
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,330
Altering perspective

70
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,290
is a herculean task.

71
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,060
The thoughts

72
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,060
a human has been harbouring
all his life

73
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,270
influence him.

74
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,290
When one's thoughts
can't be altered

75
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,260
one's decision too
can't be altered.

76
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,170
Hence, the future remains
uncertain as ever.

77
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,260
Prince Duryodhan too

78
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,230
could've set things right
for himself.

79
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,220
But he can't do anything
about it now.

80
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,130
It's ones experience

81
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,160
that influences
his thoughts, Krishna.

82
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,130
One who's experienced
injustice all his life

83
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,200
considers everyone around him
as an enemy.

84
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,060
What's wrong with it?

85
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,250
My friend deserves the throne.

86
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,250
How can you say that?

87
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,160
His father's the King.

88
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,020
A King's son
is crowned as a King.

89
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,030
Do you mean one's birth
determines what one deserves?

90
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,060
And not his capabilities!

91
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,030
You're trying to talk me
into things.

92
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,200
All I desire is respect.

93
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,060
I've never desired for power.

94
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,020
For I know

95
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,130
one's birth
determines ones rights

96
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,060
and one has to earn respect.

97
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,100
Then you only have

98
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,070
the right
to be a charioteer, Karna.

99
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Don't you want
to be a part of this war?

100
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,060
When everyone around me
mocked at my capabilities

101
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,100
my friend, Duryodhan

102
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,990
rewarded it with what
it rightfully deserved.

103
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,930
I'll have to support him now.

104
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,970
I don't consider it
a war at all, Krishna.

105
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
I am just here
to carry out my duties.

106
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,900
If you were born to a King

107
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,960
and you rightfully deserved
to be a King.

108
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,120
You weren't being favoured.

109
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,090
Would you still call
this war a duty?

110
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,160
It's baseless to reason
on this, Krishna.

111
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,120
For I wasn't born to a King.

112
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,970
I don't have the right
to be a King.

113
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,060
For one's birth

114
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,090
determines one's rights.

115
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,920
If you ask me

116
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,830
one who's capable
deserves the throne.

117
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,090
And respect...

118
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,920
Self-respect is the optimal
form of respect.

119
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,890
For one who expects
to be respected

120
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,990
is never sated

121
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,860
with the amount
of respect one gets.

122
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,020
Like you're

123
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,930
so lost
in your quest for respect

124
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,900
that you aren't able
to differentiate

125
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,930
between the right
and the wrong.

126
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,930
I don't think
Duryodhan's wrong, Krishna.

127
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,800
Because you're looking
at the truth in fragments.

128
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,020
I'd told you

129
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,030
that one's decision
carves out one's destiny.

130
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,900
One decision of yours
can alter your destiny.

131
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,060
Assume

132
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,060
if Kunti was your mother.

133
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,020
How can I assume that?

134
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,800
I am Adhiratha and Radha's son

135
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,990
who's indebted to
Duryodhan for eternity.

136
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,830
No, Karna.

137
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,860
You don't know
whom you were born to.

138
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,310
You owe your capabilities
to the Sun God.

139
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
You are

140
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,270
Lord Suryanarayana's* boon.
*The Supreme Light.

141
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,210
How do you say that? 

142
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,210
Karna

143
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,230
you weren't born
to Adhiratha and Radha.

144
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,430
They found you floating
on the Ganges.

145
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,370
So...

146
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,380
Who was I born to, Krishna?

147
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,310
You were born
to Kunti, the Queen.

148
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,180
Your father is
Lord Suryanarayana.

149
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,100
Hence you were born

150
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,300
with earrings and a shield.

151
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,180
You may ask Adhiratha about it.

152
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,170
You may ask
Lord Suryanarayana too.

153
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,140
Then

154
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,110
you may alter your perspective

155
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,330
and decide.

156
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,070
It's a request.

157
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,040
Mother!

158
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,110
Mother!

159
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,040
Where are you, mother?

160
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,270
Karna, my son!

161
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,170
I was cooking up
a meal for you.

162
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,230
Mother...
- What is it, son?

163
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,200
What did Krishna say?

164
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,070
Krishna is evil, mother.

165
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,110
He's vicious.

166
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,070
Duryodhan was right.

167
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,170
What did he say?
- Answer me, mother.

168
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,970
I...

169
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,140
I am your son, right?

170
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,170
Right?

171
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,110
You certainly are my son.

172
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,110
You definitely are!

173
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,140
That evil Krishna has been

174
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,100
trying to delude me.

175
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,100
He wants to talk me into
things by deceiving me.

176
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,130
The King of Gandhar said

177
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,030
that he'd definitely make
an effort to deceive me.

178
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,170
But how can one
deceive me this way, mother.

179
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,870
He said
that my entire life is a lie.

180
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,010
He tried to make me believe

181
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,030
that I've been living a lie
all my life.

182
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,010
He deluded me
to such an extent

183
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,970
that he questioned my existence.

184
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,130
He said

185
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,140
that you're not my mother.
That's what he did, mother.

186
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,130
No one can separate us, son.

187
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,010
You are my son.
My son.

188
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,040
Who told you that you weren't
born to me and Adhiratha?

189
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,930
How greedy can one be

190
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,130
to utter such a lie?

191
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,870
I've always been drawn

192
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,840
to the Lord Suryanarayana

193
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,870
since I was a child.

194
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,940
I can look into the eye
of the scorching Sun

195
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,930
that people stay away from.

196
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,030
No matter how heavy I feel

197
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,030
whenever I happen to see the Sun

198
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,870
I feel at ease at once.

199
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,030
My heart's filled with joy,
mother.

200
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
But...

201
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,040
But that doesn't mean

202
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,070
that I was a boon
from Lord Suryanarayana.

203
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,930
Isn't it, mother?

204
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,560
But that doesn't mean

205
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,490
that I was a boon
from Lord Suryanarayana.

206
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,720
No, son.
Try to recall.

207
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,690
Try to recall, son.

208
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,650
When you were a kid
and I'd go to fetch water...

209
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,460
I used to pay attention

210
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,460
to you as you'd cry even
when I stood near the well.

211
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Yes.

212
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,390
If you weren't my son

213
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,530
how could I hear you cry.

214
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,390
I am your mother, child.

215
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,620
How can he say

216
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,500
that you aren't my son?

217
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,490
How can he say that?

218
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,620
I am your son, mother.

219
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,490
I am your son.

220
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,550
You certainly are my son.

221
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,390
During your childhood,
when you were to save a kid

222
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,450
and you slipped off
the chariot.

223
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,430
I almost died.

224
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,590
Only a mother would be
so concerned, right?

225
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Yes.
- And... And come here.

226
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,330
Look at this, son.
Look at this.

227
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,590
I've served you food.

228
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,420
How would I know
what you'd like to eat

229
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,330
if I wasn't your mother?

230
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,550
I might not have given birth
to you.

231
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,400
But I was the one
who raised you.
