1
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,250
A father always prays for
the well being of his child.

2
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,260
He worries about
the future of his progeny.

3
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,360
Due to this

4
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,270
he always tries to decide

5
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,300
their future endeavours himself.

6
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,130
The path which the father
has tread himself...

7
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,430
The path whose pitfalls he
is familiar with...

8
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,350
He knows where lies shade and
sunshine of the path

9
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,170
That should be the path
his son should take too.

10
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,170
This is the desire
of every father.

11
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,220
Indeed, it is
a noble intention.

12
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,420
But

13
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,190
we always forget to reflect
upon three questions.

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,280
Which questions?

15
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,180
The first question.

16
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,340
Doesn't every path
change with time?

17
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,300
Doesn't time always bring forth
newer challenges?

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,240
So, how can experiences from
a time gone by

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,170
benefit the new generation?

20
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,400
The second question.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,220
Is every child
an image of his parents?

22
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,150
Yes.

23
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,300
Morals are always taught to
the children by the parents.

24
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,420
But, inner capability.

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,410
Inner capability is something
that's God gifted.

26
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,310
So do you believe the path where
the father has found success

27
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,390
is the path where the son shall

28
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,270
find success and bliss too?

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,330
Third question.

30
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,370
Aren't the challenges and
strife of life beneficial?

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
Doesn't every new question
open a portal to a new answer?

32
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,330
So does the act of
depriving children from

33
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,330
new questions, strife
and challenges

34
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,260
qualify as benefiting them
or harming them?

35
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,260
Therefore, just as
it would be best

36
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,430
to develop a child's character
rather than develop his future

37
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,210
similarly, instead of deciding
the path in a child's life

38
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,370
wouldn't empowering them
to face new conflicts

39
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,310
with confidence and knowledge
be more beneficial?

40
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,220
Think about it.

41
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,340
'As long as this thread
is tied across your wrist'

42
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,280
'you must not reveal your past
to your husband.'

43
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,220
No.

44
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,320
What devotion is it,
that nurses a secret within?

45
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,290
And what matrimony is it,
that has no devotion?

46
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,300
I must tell my lord the truth.

47
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,140
Kunti.

48
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,300
For a woman, this broach
symbolises her husband

49
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,450
By wearing this in her mane,
she assigns her husband

50
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,220
the highest position
in her life.

51
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,290
But I do not approve
of that tradition.

52
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,270
I shall adorn your hair
with this broach myself

53
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,340
as a symbol of our love
and trust.

54
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,220
Handling a woman's mane

55
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,270
seems harder
than handling a nation.

56
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,330
When it's about
handling a nation

57
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,320
one takes the help of ministers
and the court, your majesty.

58
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,310
But when it's about
arranging my hair

59
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,240
you shall have to
do it yourself.

60
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,200
May I say something, Kunti?

61
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,420
I wished to say something at
your 'Swayamvar'.

62
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,240
But I never got
the opportunity.

63
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,370
I was spellbound by
the question

64
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,380
you put forth at the
'Swayamvar'.

65
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,410
That very moment
I prayed inwardly

66
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,220
that my answer be the right one.

67
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,360
Your question was very witty.

68
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,410
Even I began praying the moment
I glanced upon you, my lord

69
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,160
that by god's grace, you answer
my question from your heart.

70
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,190
Were you testing my heart
or my intelligence?

71
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,160
Your heart, my lord.

72
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,170
A human tests

73
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,350
what he wishes to acquire.

74
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,420
You are amazing, Kunti.

75
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,410
You tested my heart
with just one question

76
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,270
and acquired it too.

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,260
For a king to surrender himself
to one's will so easily

78
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,210
isn't appropriate, my lord.

79
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,440
It is imperative that one
examines the virtues of

80
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,420
the person wanting to acquire
such a special heart.

81
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,230
Do you not trust my choice?

82
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,290
Or are you just flaunting
your caliber again?

83
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,210
No, my lord.

84
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,250
I...

85
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,300
I just want to
tell you something.

86
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,300
You have to pass the verdict.

87
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,400
A man who tests his wife,
is tested himself in turn.

88
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,280
My married friends tell me so.

89
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,190
That means, I have to
undergo another test.

90
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,370
Tell me.
What is the matter?

91
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,330
My lord...

92
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,380
I wanted to say...

93
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,420
My lord...

94
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,440
I wanted to say...

95
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,270
What is this?

96
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,210
Whose message has arrived
at this hour?

97
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,230
What happened, my lord?

98
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,240
The beat of the drums
conveys a message.

99
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,450
I'm sure, the matter is grave.

100
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,460
I must head to the royal court.

101
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,350
You cannot go to the battle,
Pandu.

102
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,280
You have just been married.

103
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,440
Forgive me, Queen Mother.

104
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,440
My personal pleasure cannot
hinder my sense of duty.

105
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,230
If the need for battle
has arisen

106
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,180
It is my duty to answer it.

107
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,380
I shall command the charges
during the battle, your majesty.

108
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,450
You shall have plenty of battle
opportunities, your majesty.

109
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
For a king,
no war is a final one.

110
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,330
But the first battle is
always the first one.

111
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,430
The subjects always have doubts

112
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,200
about a new king's potential,
grandfather.

113
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,380
Pandu must display his strength
at the earliest opportunity.

114
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,380
I beg your pardon, grandfather
but that is my opinion.

115
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
I may be blind.

116
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,310
But I know how to wage war.

117
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,430
I shall go instead.

118
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,190
Brother is right, grandfather.

119
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,290
It is our duty to help
the kingdom of Madra.

120
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,460
Whoever has attacked Madra

121
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,340
has done so under the assumption
that I'm a new king

122
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,330
and I'm just married.

123
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,210
I would have neither
the courage, nor the inclination

124
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,440
to help Madra.

125
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,260
The enemy wishes to gauge me.

126
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,170
And I shall undergo the test
put forth by him.

127
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,290
Have you even thought
about Kunti?

128
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,280
She shall be heartbroken.

129
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,180
What will you tell her?

130
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,210
What happened, my lord?

131
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,450
Is it distressing news?

132
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,210
A news that is pleasurable
to one

133
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,440
is perceived to be distressing
by the other.

134
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,320
A husband and a wife
aren't separate, my lord.

135
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,300
They are one.

136
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,260
What is pleasurable to you,
shall be pleasurable to me too.

137
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,270
Tell me, what is the news?

138
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,410
Someone has attacked
our ally nation.

139
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,380
I must go to battle.

140
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,370
This very moment.

141
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,190
Mother and grandfather insisted

142
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,240
that someone else will
proceed with our army.

143
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,300
But I said that this was
the king's duty.

144
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,470
Hence, I shall go to the battle
myself.

145
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,210
I should have consulted you
before coming to this decision.

146
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,450
But...
- No, my lord.

147
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,190
You have taken a decision
that truly befits a king.

148
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:46,260
If the ruler of Hastinapur
took any other decision

149
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,260
I would be disappointed.

150
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,370
I am aware that a queen would
be gratified.

151
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,440
But I wish to know what
a wife's heart feels.

152
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,170
If you are angry upon me

153
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,170
you have every right
to do so, Kunti.

154
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,290
The first night of our wedding
has brought us separation.

155
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,430
An eclipse always obscures
a full moon.

156
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,260
But after the eclipse,
that very moon

157
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,420
appears more bright and radiant.

158
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,410
I shall wait for you, my lord.

159
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,250
When shall you commence?

160
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,330
Now.
This very moment.

161
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,320
I could have spent the first
night with you and left by dawn.

162
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,200
But that would be my
weakness, Kunti.

163
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,200
And once a person surrenders
to his weakness

164
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,320
he is weakened forever.

165
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,430
I am here to be your strength,
my lord.

166
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,430
I shall not be your weakness.

167
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,410
I am a queen as well.

168
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,310
You shall be victorious
and return soon.

169
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,320
I am confident.

170
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,730
Do you wish to say
something, Kunti?

171
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,550
If something ails your heart,
you may tell me.

172
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,730
No, my lord.

173
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,560
All that my heart possesses
are prayers for you.

174
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,710
May you be victorious.

175
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,660
May you return with a token
of victory from Madrapur.

176
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,540
I shall be waiting for you.

177
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,460
Soldiers...

178
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,540
Har Har Mahadev!*
Hail Lord Shiva!

179
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,480
Har Har Mahadev!

180
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,650
Har Har Mahadev!

181
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,550
Har Har Mahadev!

182
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,730
Proceed.

183
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,700
'A few months later...'

184
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,660
Waiting is something every queen
is destined for, Kunti.

185
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,550
Turn your wait into
penance.

186
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,630
Not a lament.

187
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,460
Forgive me, sister-in-law.

188
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,530
I do not wish to cause all of
you anguish with my behaviour.

189
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,600
So why have you ceased eating?

190
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,460
What else can I do,
sister-in-law?

191
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,600
Earlier, we would get messages
through the beating of drums.

192
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,680
But now we are not getting any
messages from the battlefield.

193
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,610
No messages being conveyed
mean only one thing, Kunti.

194
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,750
That they have no good news
to convey yet.

195
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,590
But at least there
is an assurance

196
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,560
that there is no bad news too.

197
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,640
But my ears

198
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,600
are craving to hear
the drums, sister-in-law.

199
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,640
We will get a message.

200
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,700
And it shall surely be
good news.

201
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,580
I have complete faith
in Pandu.
