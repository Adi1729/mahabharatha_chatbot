1
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,110
Don't waste your potential by
punishing yourself, Yudhisthira.

2
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,140
They, who are the cause
of this state of yours

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,270
need to be punished.

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,110
They, who tried to dishonour
my friend's dignity!

5
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,110
If the wife of five Pandavas
can be treated like this

6
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
then much worse can happen
to ordinary women

7
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,170
in Duryodhan's kingdom.

8
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,170
Give it a thought.

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,270
Justice and protection...

10
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,200
It's your righteous duty
to establish these two.

11
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,230
Not for revenge.

12
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,240
You will have to fight a battle
for the ultimate reality.

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Here are the five gems
of the tiara

14
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,230
which Madhav had given you.

15
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,040
But don't adorn them
in the tiara.

16
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,140
Your vow was justified.

17
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
Until the battle is over

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
neither tie your hair

19
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,130
nor adorn the tiara.

20
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,210
Your open locks
will keep reminding us

21
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,170
of our life's goal!

22
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,200
If that's your promise

23
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,940
then listen to my
resolution...

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,110
Until I wash my hair
with the blood

25
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,130
from Dushasana's chest

26
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,140
I will not tie my hair!

27
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,010
That will definitely happen,
Draupadi.

28
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,940
I will wash your hair with the
blood from Dushasana's chest.

29
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,070
King Dhritarashtra
and Queen Gandhari's lives

30
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,100
will see no ray of light,
Draupadi.

31
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,940
Only darkness
will surround them!

32
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,870
Forgive me, Your Highness

33
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,140
but we have been ordered
to put off the lamps.

34
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
Orders to put off the lamps?
- Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,940
It's the Queen's orders
that there will be darkness

36
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,030
in the whole of Hastinapur,
today.

37
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,040
No lamps or flambeaux shall
be lit even in the royal palace.

38
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,070
Forgive me, but I will
have to carry out the orders.

39
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,070
Mother, what sort
of an order have you given?

40
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,010
Why are all the lamps
and flambeaux

41
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
of the palace
being put off?

42
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,880
Because the whole of Hastinapur
is in darkness today, Duryodhan.

43
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,970
No one is able to see
their future.

44
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,970
Everyone's stumbling
in darkness

45
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,030
but no one knows
it's darkness.

46
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,010
These lamps and flambeaux
give everyone

47
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,040
a false illusion of light.
- You can see darkness

48
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,970
because you're blindfolded,
dear sister.

49
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,840
In reality, today, Hastinapur
sees the light of fortune.

50
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,040
You should declare Diwali

51
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
in the whole kingdom.
- Brother!

52
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,880
You see fortune?

53
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
How?

54
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,770
Pandavas will definitely return
to take revenge.

55
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,930
They will kill
all my 100 sons.

56
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,900
But how will you understand
what I'm going through?

57
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,900
You have always given more
importance to ambitions.

58
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Duryodhan...

59
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,970
You have taught Duryodhan
to love the throne

60
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,970
more than his mother.

61
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,840
I know that you have given
a lot of love to my sons.

62
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,880
But it's the result of your love
that Duryodhan

63
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,840
has continuously been committing
unrighteous deeds

64
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,970
in order to get the throne.

65
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,770
Brother

66
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,710
at least for once you
should have thought of me.

67
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,710
Other women bear their children
in their womb

68
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,770
for just nine months.

69
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,670
I

70
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,900
kept them in my womb
for two years.

71
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,830
How will I be able to bear

72
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,710
the news of their death?

73
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,670
Why will we die, mother?

74
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,840
You have no faith in my
strength, mother.

75
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,900
Keep quiet, Duryodhan.

76
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,710
I heard from the maids about
what happened at the court.

77
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,770
How all the apparels

78
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,610
covered Draupadi
in the court.

79
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,610
Even after seeing
that miracle

80
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,800
you're boasting
about your strength.

81
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,600
Draupadi's curse

82
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,870
is still echoing
in my ears.

83
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,740
'This is the curse
of Yajna's child, Draupadi.'

84
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,800
'Duryodhan will definitely
be punished for his deeds.'

85
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,770
Thirteen years later

86
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,640
when I'll return their
property to them

87
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,640
I'll definitely ask
Yudhisthira to promise

88
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,570
to not wage a war.

89
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,710
No such occasion shall arise,
Your Highness.

90
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,570
No property shall be returned.

91
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,800
In the incognito
year of exile

92
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,830
we will crush
the Pandavas

93
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,840
and send them
to exile

94
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,540
once again.

95
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,540
This is a false hope,
brother.

96
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,640
My heart

97
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,680
trembles every moment.

98
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,770
Brother...

99
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,570
Brother

100
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,540
till today I always stopped
you from doing unrighteous.

101
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Today I request to you

102
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,510
do anything
unrighteous...

103
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,670
Yes, unrighteous deed!
Definitely.

104
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,570
I will take responsibility
for all the sins.

105
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,610
If Vasudeva Krishna
fights the battle

106
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,580
along with the Pandavas

107
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,640
then my family
will be ruined.

108
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,630
My family will be ruined,
brother.

109
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,530
It will be ruined!

110
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,730
Mother!
- Gandhari!

111
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,540
Vasudeva Krishna!

112
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,070
May you be glorious,
Pandavas.

113
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,290
For 12 years to come

114
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,030
prepare for war.

115
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Arjun, like Goddess Durga's
trident...

116
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,090
Like Lord Brahma's
four faced weapon...

117
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
In the same manner

118
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,070
is Lord Mahadev's
weapon of destruction.

119
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,240
During the battle,
if you ever face a situation

120
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,130
where you have
to confront a power

121
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,030
which is beyond
your competency

122
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,000
then you will need

123
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,090
Lord Mahadev's weapon.

124
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Hence, Arjun

125
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,030
go to Kailash.

126
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,100
Practice austerity
to please Mahadev

127
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,040
and acquire
the weapon from him.

128
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,070
Bhima

129
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,160
the science
of physical strength...

130
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,970
No one knows that better
than Hanuman.

131
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,190
Hence you will

132
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
go to mountain Gandhamadana
*Mt. Gandhamadana is the tallest peak on Pamban Island which lies in the Palk Strait between mainland India and Sri Lanka.

133
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,190
and near the Hanumanth cave

134
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,130
you will perform penance
for Lord Hanuman.

135
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,030
Acquire strength from him.

136
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,130
Nakula

137
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,030
Sahadeva

138
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,130
both of you will have to acquire
the benevolence of the Ashvins

139
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,160
so that when time comes

140
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,100
you're able to protect
your army.

141
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,070
Yudhisthira

142
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,860
you very well know

143
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,970
that righteousness
is the basis of victory

144
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,940
and the basis of righteousness
is serving the ascetics

145
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,930
as well as the company
of the highest truth.

146
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,970
Hence you and Draupadi

147
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,060
for the next 12 years

148
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,030
will serve the ascetics

149
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,930
and gather virtue.

150
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,060
Your wish is our command.

151
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,130
Subhadra will be safe with you
at Dwarka.

152
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,990
Definitely, Arjun.

153
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,970
Subhadra's son who
takes birth there...

154
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,890
I will train him
to be a warrior.

155
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,960
Your son Abhimanyu will
be immortal in history, Arjun.

156
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,870
All of you proceed
towards the forest.

157
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
May you be blessed
with a blissful life.

158
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,250
Why is righteousness
defeated, brother?

159
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,160
And why does unrighteousness
win?

160
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,120
Achieving something
is not victory

161
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,260
and losing something
is not defeat.

162
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,260
It's the impact of time,
Subhadra.

163
