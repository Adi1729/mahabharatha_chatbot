1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:10,960
I am nothing.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,860
But I am also everything.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,640
This has happened in every age

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,090
and will happen in future,
as well.

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,280
When you reflect on your own being.

6
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,970
You will find that your own self is 
also connected to me.

7
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,160
And then, like me,

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,170
you'll find that you are also within the avatar
of the Almighty.

9
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,630
But to reach that stage,

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,960
it is important for you to 
wholly submit to me.

11
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,060
What do you mean with 
'submit', Madhav?

12
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,140
It is a state of mind

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
where one surrenders all one's desires.

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,330
Not making any expectations for oneself.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,130
And not taking any oath

16
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,190
for anyone according to

17
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,710
what is requested from him.

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,950
In short, submitting yourself to someone,

19
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,320
willingly.
Your mind,

20
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,800
your thought, your knowledge,

21
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,340
your wish, your desire, your emotion,

22
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,480
and all that you have,

23
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,010
to someone.

24
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,360
That commitment is called submission.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,640
A wife committed to her husband.

26
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,320
A soldier committed to his general.

27
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,000
A student committed to his teacher.

28
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,770
Isn't all these submissions the same?

29
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,050
Isn't all of them reaching God?

30
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,460
No, Arjuna.

31
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,380
When one committed to something
or someone,

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,370
it's according to its circumstances.

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,790
One that leaves no room for doubts
or questions.

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,610
Commitment to someone evil,

35
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,260
can make one to slander.

36
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,880
King of Anga, Karna, even when 
he knows what is right,

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,960
slanders Panchali in the 
game of dice.

38
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,600
'A woman that has relations to five men'

39
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,660
'is no better than a harlot.'

40
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,100
And because of

41
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,900
King of Anga's committment 
to brother Duryodhana,

42
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,430
he will get punishment in this war.

43
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,280
Is that so?

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,650
No. But because of his loyalty
to an evil person.

45
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,430
That's why, Arjuna,

46
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,700
it is important to commit oneself 
to what is right.

47
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,340
That will make a human righteous.

48
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,780
Otherwise one is like a criminal that's 
bound with an iron chains.

49
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,340
Like a temple lamp bound by 
a brass chains.

50
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,540
Like a gold chains around our neck,

51
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,000
just as ornament.

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,260
Loyalty to a husband, 
loyalty to a teacher,

53
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,730
loyalty to friends, they are but
some forms of loyalty.

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,630
But the true loyalty of all,

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,280
is your loyalty to God.

56
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,240
But is dedication to God

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,480
must be fulfilled with "sankhya yoga" 
or "karma yoga"?

58
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,360
Because of "sankhya yoga"

59
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,840
human knows that they are 
only souls.

60
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,640
And because of 'karma yoga'

61
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,940
they can liberate themselves 
from the bind.

62
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,490
And that's because through dedication

63
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,950
human knows the real manifestation 
of the Almighty,

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,950
and knows about the Almighty.

65
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,930
A human is in the circle of life and death.

66
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,670
To reach bliss and knowledge,

67
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,260
a human dedicate itself to the Almighty,

68
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,920
and becomes the Almighty.

69
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,260
Just like water falls into a river,

70
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,870
and becomes the river itself.

71
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,020
So do you mean,

72
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,770
that this human body has 
no value, Madhav?

73
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,850
It surely has value, Arjuna.

74
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,440
A human body is a medium

75
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,610
for human to meet the Almighty.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,590
Between death and reincarnation,

77
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,660
with soul's knowledge is still active,

78
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,260
with experience, thoughts,

79
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,720
and learnings from the previous life,

80
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,310
the soul becomes part of a new body.

81
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,030
The soul growth and its commitment,

82
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,170
it only happens when it becomes part of 
a human body.

83
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,580
But, Madhav, by killing people that 
are present here,

84
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,250
do we not destroy their 
chance of liberation?

85
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,260
Your enemies have gone past the limits 
of righteousness.

86
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,140
Evil had become their second nature.

87
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,740
Liberation for them is not possible.

88
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,620
Sinners only given chance

89
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,620
to reform to a certain time.

90
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,480
I had given Sishupala 99 offences,

91
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,100
but it becomes necessary to punish him,

92
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,610
for his 100th offence.

93
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,820
If we let sinners do evils,

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,620
they will do more and more.

95
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,220
Righteousness is stopping them 
committing sins.

96
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,190
These souls will not meet their ends,

97
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,700
but leave their bodies that had been 
corrupted with evils.

98
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,820
And become part of a new human body.

99
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,020
And there are more opportunities to reform 
in their new bodies.

100
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,740
If you fight this war with this logic,

101
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,540
it would be justifed.

102
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,480
A human body, to a human, is its wealth.

103
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,380
As bhakti,* as dignity.
*Dedication.

104
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,910
Those who tread the path of truth,

105
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,680
will purify their bodies.

106
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
And, through that path,

107
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,680
they will meet their souls.

108
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,360
This is the relation between 'kshetra'* and 'kshetragna'.*
*Field, area, tract of land. **The fielder.

109
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,180
I don't understand, Madhav.

110
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
When one knows,

111
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,930
that one's body is like this dirt,

112
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,750
meaning, only a 'kshetra', a place.

113
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,660
And one who's aware of a land,

114
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,880
and standing on top of it is 'kshetragna'.

115
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,720
Then through his body,

116
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,380
one can measure one's progress.

117
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,600
A soul in the body balancing 
the 3 righteousness,

118
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,320
annihilates darkness,

119
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,460
and opening path for righteousness.

120
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,520
And with dedication to God,

121
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,760
it becomes one with the Almighty.

122
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
But the worshipper

123
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,600
is devoting but not dedicating?

124
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,440
No, Arjuna.

125
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,490
That is the first step to dedication.

126
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,240
In reality, dedication is not a duty.

127
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,600
It is a meditated state of mind.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,670
It is important for human 
to purify its soul.

129
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,510
Through prayers, repentaces,

130
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,220
'yogna', ritual,

131
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,860
'yoga' dan self learnings.

132
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,000
And remain devoted to the Almighty.

133
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,040
Devoting all his actions,

134
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,580
all moments,

135
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,520
each breath,

136
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,560
to the Almighty.

137
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,670
If dedication is only a state of mind,

138
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,900
then what use is prayers, repentances,

139
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,430
and all of these others?

140
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,250
They are only means to 
cleanse your self.

141
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,720
Cause it will be soiled again.

142
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,460
Human mind needs

143
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,810
to be repeatedly reminded of the Almighty.

144
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,660
That's why it is important

145
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,340
to pray, repent, self development, 
and others.

146
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,120
One needs to remind oneself, 
all the time,

147
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,210
that one's life is to serve the Almighty.

148
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,500
It's not important to know which river,

149
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,290
what's important is that you dive in it.

150
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,430
There's only one dedication in 'bhakti yoga',

151
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,960
that by surrendering one's life 
to the Almighty,

152
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,690
one will keep one's dedication 
to the Almighty,

153
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,690
and one will do good deeds in one's lives.

154
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,920
What is righteousness and kindness, Madhav?

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,810
Violence without reason or necessity, 
is not right, Arjuna.

156
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,240
In reality, nonviolence is a supreme decision.

157
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,430
And along with it, truth,

158
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,500
refrain from anger, sacrifice,

159
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,630
peace of mind, refrain from mocking,

160
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,520
generous,

161
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,320
actions without expecting rewards,

162
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,260
greatness, compassion, patience,

163
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,700
do not indulge in self praise, not egoistic,

164
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,940
all these qualities is called

165
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,460
the cardinal possession.

166
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,520
Only with help from these, a human becomes 
my true worshiper.

167
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,560
Fullfill their duties in life.

168
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,140
Establish truth.

169
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,980
And live without attachment to the fruit 
of his deeds.

170
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,220
I will certainly,

171
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,560
grant happiness in his life,

172
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,780
and absorb him into my self 
after his death.

173
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
What is your true form, Madhav?

174
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,680
Through 'sankya yoga',

175
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,260
I know if my soul (atma),

176
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,920
is eternal.

177
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,240
And that it is in this temporal body only 
for a certain time.

178
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,740
I know how, through actions without 
expecting rewards,

179
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,840
sacrificing the desire for rewards,

180
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,480
and fullfill one's duties,

181
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,620
one attains peace of mind and 
happiness in life.

182
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,100
Through spiritual discipline,

183
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,700
I know how important is 
submittance to you.

184
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,400
But, Madhav, you say

185
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,560
that to the Almighty

186
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
no humans are standing here, 
or all place,

187
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,960
but

188
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
I still see humans standing here.

189
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,000
All humans, Madhav.

190
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,540
I want to have a glimpse of your 
true being, Madhav.

191
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Your power, glory, knowledge,

192
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,700
in all majesty,

193
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,820
divine form. 
I want to see it, Madhav.

194
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,000
Display your devastating being 
to me, Madhav,

195
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,960
to quash all doubts in my heart.

196
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,280
Show your self, Madhav.

197
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,500
Behold, Arjuna.

198
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,360
Through the knowledge of divinity (sankya yoga), one attains discipline in altruistic deeds.

199
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,800
Through that discipline (karma yoga), 
one attains spirituality.

200
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
And through spirituality (bhakti yoga), 
one attains knowledge.

201
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,520
Behold that my 'murti'* form
*An image in which the Divine Spirit is expressed ('murta').

202
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,660
is the knowldge of the truth, Arjuna.

203
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,300
This is the supreme knowledge.

204
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,580
This form is the base of all 
knowledge and sciences.

205
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,960
This knowledge bestows salvation.

206
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,320
Even the gods can't see this form easily.

207
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,840
This form I manifested for you, Arjuna.

208
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,000
I reside in each and every particle 
of this universe.

209
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,240
And earth, sun, moon,

210
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,380
galaxy, and constellations reside in me.
