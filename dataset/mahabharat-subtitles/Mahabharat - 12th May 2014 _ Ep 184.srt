1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,720
So, this is
the new-born.

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,080
It is time
to sacrifice him, Devaki.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,320
No, brother!

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,520
What crime did this
boy child commit?

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,800
It has committed
the crime of being born!

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,600
Your child is my doom.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,560
Him being born
is a crime, Devaki.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,880
But our first child
will not kill you.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,200
Our eighth child
is meant to slay you.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,920
This is what the voice
from the sky had said.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,800
Every fruit of a poisonous tree
is poisonous, Vasudev.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,560
I will not spare
a single child of yours.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,600
Along with Mathura,
the entire nation should know

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,240
that if a person even
dreams of revolting against me

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
then he will die
right after his birth!

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,040
Devaki

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,720
give me your child.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,840
Give him to me!

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
No, brother!
I will not give my son to you!

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,400
What is his crime?
- Let me go!

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,360
He is soft and fragile.
- Let me go!

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,680
If you see his face,
your heart will melt.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,320
Just look at him,
brother.

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,800
Just look at his face.
- Foolish Devaki!

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Even a lion cub

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,360
is defenseless and fragile
like a kitten!

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,200
But when it grows up, it becomes
the King of the Jungle!

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,480
That is why, I will not let
any of your children live.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,440
No!

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
Give me your child!
Give him to me!

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,280
Give him!

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,560
No, brother!
- No, Kansa!

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,280
No!

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Brother,
let my child go.

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
My Lord...

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,960
You are my doom?
- No!

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,320
No! - Take my life instead
but please let him live!

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Let him go,
brother!

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Will you kill me?

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
My Lord...

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,320
Let me go...
- My Lord...

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
My Lord...
- No...

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,160
Kansa!
If you kill him

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,480
then do remember!

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,760
We will sacrifice
seven children of ours

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,840
even if it kills our souls!

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,200
But our eighth son meant
to slay you will indeed be born!

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,760
If you have the competence

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
then go ahead
and kill him as well!

50
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,120
No, brother!
- No...

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
No, Kansa.
No!

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,960
Uncle

53
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,320
were all the children
born before you

54
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,000
killed by King Kansa of Mathura?

55
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,200
Yes, dear.

56
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,320
Both sins and merits

57
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,240
are like a pearl necklace.

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,800
The way the first pearl
attracts the second

59
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,920
and the second
attracts the third

60
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
similarly

61
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
one good deed leads to another

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,160
while one sin leads to another.

63
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,960
Sin fuels the arrogance
of a person.

64
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,480
A person can stop himself
from committing another sin

65
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,720
only when he sees the grave
consequence of that sin.

66
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,240
But a person
blinded by arrogance

67
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,520
is unable to see
that consequence.

68
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
The tradition of
unrighteousness and crime

69
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,320
keeps getting augmented by him.

70
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,320
The number of treacherous
and deceitful acts

71
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
and crimes
a society can tolerate

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,680
and the number of crimes
it can pardon

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,120
is decided
by the society itself.

74
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,960
In a society, the one who has
the power to punish the wrong

75
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,560
needs to take that decision.

76
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
But uncle,
how were Mother Devaki

77
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
and grandsire Vasudev
able to make so many sacrifices?

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,920
Did their hearts not break

79
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,920
when a new-born child
was sacrificed each time?

80
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,960
Dear Prativindhya

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,440
after the death
of their first son

82
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,320
mother Devaki and father Vasudev
were robbed

83
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
of their happiness for life.

84
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,280
The truth is

85
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,120
those children
were not sacrificed, dear.

86
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
In that war against
unrighteousness

87
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
they were the brave martyrs.

88
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,280
The happiness

89
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,160
of my parents
had been sacrificed.

90
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,840
But why did they have to make
such a grave sacrifice, uncle?

91
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,960
Dear Srutakarman

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,520
do you know what is the limit
of the sacrifices for the people

93
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
trying to establish
righteousness?

94
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,640
The limit of the sins
of the sinners

95
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,960
is the limit
of their sacrifices.

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
In other words

97
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,280
until the sinners and their sins
get annihilated

98
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,080
the sacrifices

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,480
to be made by the righteous

100
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,800
cannot come to an end.

101
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,680
Am I correct,
friend?

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
Dhundhumali

103
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,560
please tell my sons now

104
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
how my brother Shri Krishna

105
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,280
was able to survive.

106
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
In this manner,
the wicked Kansa

107
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,520
killed all the children
of Devaki and Vasudev.

108
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,280
It was then the time
for the eighth son to be born.

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,920
My Lord...

110
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,400
My Lord,
are these thunders

111
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
a sign...

112
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,600
A sign of death
of our eighth son?

113
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
I am exceedingly frightened,
My Lord.

114
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,200
Each time a child
of mine was killed

115
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,240
I too died along with them,
My Lord.

116
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,640
But I remembered,
My Lord

117
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,960
that giving birth
to our eighth son

118
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,200
is my duty.

119
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,760
That is why...

120
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
That is why,
I am alive until now.

121
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
If brother

122
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,920
kills our eighth son

123
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,520
before our eyes

124
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,040
then I will not be able to live!

125
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
I will not be able to live!

126
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,240
If that happens,
Devaki

127
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,280
then I too shall embrace death.

128
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,400
But I have firm faith,
Devaki

129
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
that in order to salvage
the entire world

130
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,320
our eighth son
will indeed be born.

131
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
And this time, Kansa will
not be able to kill him.

132
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,760
The power to thwart
the wish of the Almighty

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
does not reside in Kansa.

134
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,200
Guard!

135
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,080
What is this
sinister environment?

136
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,240
What is this illusion?

137
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,240
Guard!
Guard!

138
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,440
Greetings,
Your Highness.

139
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,160
Go to the prison
and examine the situation.

140
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,200
The moment you hear the cry
of Devaki's eighth son

141
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
inform me at once!

142
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,760
If you delay even by a moment

143
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,520
then the way a potter
removes a pot from the wheel

144
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,120
I shall have you beheaded!

145
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,640
Go! - As you say,
Your Highness.

146
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,400
Tonight

147
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,040
Devaki's eighth son
will indeed be born.

148
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
My Lord!

149
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,900
Do not be frightened

150
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,620
Vasudev, the eldest
of the Yadavas.

151
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,620
Devaki,
the daughter of Devak

152
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,980
bless you!

153
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,260
When Hiranyaksh had submerged
the earth in the cosmic ocean

154
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,180
I had assumed the Varaha Avatar

155
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,540
and salvaged the earth.

156
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,380
In my Narasimha Avatar

157
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,540
I had slain Hiranyakashipu.

158
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,940
In my Vaman Avatar

159
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I had established King Bali
in the netherworld.

160
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,140
Each time human beings

161
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,780
forget the essence
of righteousness

162
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
each time their hearts

163
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,220
are robbed of virtues

164
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,820
when competition
takes the place of love

165
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,500
and arrogance

166
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,060
takes the place of kindness

167
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,300
and a King begins to exploit
his own subjects

168
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,700
and begins to covet

169
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,300
polity and power
more than the truth

170
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,060
I am born on this earth.

171
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,860
Today,
once again

172
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,900
I must assume
another avatar of mine.

173
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,340
The two of you

174
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,540
have made numerous sacrifices
in the name of righteousness.

175
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,580
Upon seeing your agony

176
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,940
even the Gods in the heavens
are overwhelmed with sorrow.

177
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,300
But through your medium

178
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,340
the world

179
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,340
will receive

180
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,380
righteousness and peace
as sacraments.

181
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,060
I will be born as your son

182
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,660
and play in your lap,
mother.

183
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,980
In this auspicious hour

184
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,380
I shall enter your womb
with all my skills and powers.

185
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,140
I, Vishnu,
bless the entire world

186
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,420
but now, I seek your blessings
for this endeavour.

187
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,700
Do accept me
as your son, mother.
