1
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Kripi

2
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,100
now, our son Ashwatthama

3
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,200
will never have to drink rice
flour mixture instead of milk.

4
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,100
My friend Drupad will rid us
of our poverty forever.

5
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,980
Let's go, son.
Let's go.

6
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,940
Drupad

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,910
do you remember something?

8
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,940
This is the same palace

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,070
and I was standing right here

10
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,940
in this spot.

11
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,870
And you

12
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,910
were sitting there
on your throne.

13
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,980
Long live, Your Majesty!
A Brahmin has come to meet you.

14
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,950
He says, he is your friend.
- My friend?

15
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,000
It is me, friend.

16
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,840
It is me, friend Drupad.

17
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,910
Your companion during your stay at the 'gurukul.'*
'Seminary', -kula refers to the teacher's domain, comprised of the teacher's home and school, where students are embraced as part of the family.

18
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,040
Drona.

19
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,980
There you go. This mendicant
is the King's friend?

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,070
Have you even seen your clothes?

21
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,880
The guard stationed at the
palace should be punished

22
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,810
because he allowed
this person in

23
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,900
otherwise he will allow
every possible creature

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,810
to enter the palace.

25
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,940
A relationship like friendship

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,070
cannot be weighed
in terms of clothes.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,880
It is about memories.

28
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,840
And my friend Drupad

29
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,900
remembers every moment

30
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,070
that we had spent in the
'gurukul' of Sage Bharadwaj.

31
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,810
What are you rambling
on about, Brahmin?

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,950
What friendship are you
talking about?

33
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,840
Friend

34
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,010
what kind of a question is that?

35
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,810
I am Drona. The son
of Sage Bharadwaj, Drona!

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,780
You used to learn difficult
weapon movements from me.

37
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,000
Do you not remember?

38
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,870
I remember everything.
I know

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
you were a fellow student
in the 'gurukul.'

40
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,740
But I do not remember
any friendship.

41
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,930
You do not remember
our friendship?

42
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,780
But friend...

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Friend Drupad,
you had befriended me.

44
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,740
Do you remember the night
when we were herding cattle

45
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,850
and I had saved your life by
shooting a lion with an arrow?

46
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,840
Did you forget
that incident as well?

47
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,810
Try to remember, Drupad.

48
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Try to remember that day.

49
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,680
Do you remember your reply?

50
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,840
You had insulted me
by umeashing your arrogance

51
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,670
in the royal court.

52
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,650
My soldiers
save my life every day!

53
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,830
That does not
make them my friends!

54
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,800
In a field

55
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,610
wheat and a grass called
'rajak' grow together.

56
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,850
That does not make 'rajak'
as valuable as wheat.

57
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,750
You had promised
to be my friend forever.

58
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,650
You said, we'd have the right
to each other's properties.

59
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,680
That we'd have the right
to each other's lives.

60
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,840
And that we'll divide
everything we get equally.

61
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
But

62
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,810
you forgot everything, Drupad.

63
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,580
It wasn't like I asked you
for half your kingdom, friend.

64
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,680
All I wanted

65
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,680
was two cows from you.

66
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,730
That's it.

67
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,680
Give this Brahmin
ten cows in charity.

68
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,770
I don't want charity!

69
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,800
The son of Bharadwaj

70
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,640
does not accept charity, Drupad.

71
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,800
Give me just one cow
for it is my right.

72
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,600
Your love

73
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,670
will be an example of friendship
to the entire world.

74
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,770
If you seek alms then go ahead.

75
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,740
I can write two villages
in your name

76
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,700
on a gold parchment.

77
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,750
But if you talk about rights

78
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,540
you will be sentenced to death

79
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,640
for insulting me
in my royal court!

80
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,510
Insult?

81
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,740
Drupad

82
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,700
my friendship seems
an insult to you today?

83
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,670
During the examinations,
you'd wait for me outside my hut

84
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,480
in order to gain knowledge from
me and to learn various arts!

85
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,670
Did my friendship not seem
insulting to you then?

86
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,740
Be quiet, Brahmin!

87
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,640
Getting additional aid
from a student in a 'gurukul'

88
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,670
does not establish a friendship
that lasts for ages!

89
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,650
Did you teach me
anything special?

90
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,580
Regardless,
I was the one to learn

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,670
the son of Prishata, Drupad!

92
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,650
It was my intellect that
absorbed all the knowledge!

93
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,580
It was not
some miracle of yours!

94
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,470
If you prize your life

95
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,510
then go from here!
- Drupad!

96
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,600
When a friend breaks a promise

97
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
it is a more grave crime
than murder itself.

98
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,640
Another name of Sun God is 'Mitra'*
'Friend, partner.'

99
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,670
because He had promised
to illuminate the earth

100
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,600
and He has
never broken his promise.

101
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
And today...

102
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,670
Today, the throne that inflates
your arrogance, Drupad...

103
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,430
I promise you

104
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,480
I will have you removed
from that throne.

105
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,640
You have insulted my teaching.

106
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,670
You have insulted my art.

107
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,430
Then hear me!

108
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,640
When I come to take over
your kingdom

109
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,440
I will not do so
by drawing any weapon.

110
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,470
I will train my disciples

111
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,450
who will make you
bow before me.

112
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
I will train my disciples

113
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,750
who will make you
bow before me.

114
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,910
And today, I have

115
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,840
fulfilled my promise, Drupad.

116
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Arjun

117
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,650
release Drupad of his shackles.

118
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,910
Drupad himself

119
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,740
will assist Ashwatthama
to the throne.

120
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,840
Drupad himself

121
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,740
will anoint Ashwatthama
with milk.

122
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,710
I had come to you so that you
would give my son milk to drink.

123
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,710
But today, you have
bathed him in milk, Drupad.

124
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,450
Yudhishthir,
your brothers and you

125
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,710
have achieved a great feat.

126
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,710
It has been established
that among the Kuru Princes

127
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,550
you are undoubtedly
the most superior.

128
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,510
Arjun

129
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,410
your valour will immortalise you
till the end of time.

130
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
Now, all of you
may return to Hastinapur.

131
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,480
Me and my son Ashwatthama
will stay here for a while

132
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,570
in order to chalk out
his kingdom's governance.

133
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,510
May you live long.

134
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,650
The situation I was once in

135
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,380
I will never let you be in it.

136
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,650
I return half the kingdom
conquered to you.

137
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,640
Go to the city of Kampilya

138
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,410
and rule half the kingdom
of Panchal in peace.

139
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,380
Besides, you have no son.

140
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,840
I return half the
kingdom conquered to you.

141
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,970
Go to the city of Kampilya

142
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,810
and rule half the kingdom
of Panchal in peace.

143
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,740
Besides, you have no son.

144
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,880
So, why don't you consider
my son Ashwatthama as yours

145
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,740
and help him rule
the kingdom, friend?

146
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,000
And forget everything

147
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,710
and become my friend
once again.

148
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,830
'Panchal - City of Kampilya.'

149
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,800
'Hastinapur.'

150
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,830
Where did Duryodhan
and all his brothers go?

151
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,640
They left for Hastinapur
long back, brother.

152
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,870
Maybe they lack the courage
to accompany us to Hastinapur.

153
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,900
How can he fall sleep
on an empty stomach?

154
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,730
That too on a horse.

155
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,740
Brother Arjun
has conquered sleep.

156
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,640
He can go without sleep
for a month.

157
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,670
And he can go to asleep,
irrespective of his environment.

158
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,740
Yes, I know.
People have conquered kingdoms

159
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,830
and my younger brother
has conquered sleep.

160
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,810
Nakul, we should
rest for a while.

161
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,570
I am famished.

162
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,610
Had I known that fighting
in a battle makes one so hungry

163
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,800
I would...
- What?

164
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,840
I would have fought
a battle every day.

165
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,800
One doesn't feel hungry
after a battle, brother Bheem.

166
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,770
One feels hungry
after winning it.

167
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,730
Are you awake?
But you were asleep.

168
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,740
The smaller the time period
between sleeping and waking up

169
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,640
the greater is
the success of man.

170
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,600
This is what our teacher says.

171
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,810
Even I know a person

172
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,570
who is the same, irrespective
of him being asleep or awake.

173
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,730
He keeps dreaming all the time.

174
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,630
Bheem

175
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,770
quit talking about Duryodhan
in this manner.

176
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,540
When one is agitated

177
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,740
trying to calm him
with soothing words

178
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,770
is most appropriate.

179
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,800
Brother, do you truly believe
Duryodhan will ever be at peace?

180
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,510
Will he ever accept his defeat?

181
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,540
Will he ever accept you
as the Crowned Prince?

182
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
No one can have
such a weak heart

183
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,640
where righteousness
cannot dwell.
