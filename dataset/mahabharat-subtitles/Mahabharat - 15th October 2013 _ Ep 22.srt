1
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,700
Lord...

2
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,770
Don't say anything

3
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,640
instead, just hear
me out, Gandhari.

4
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,670
Emotions are really peculiar.

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,600
They flow like water and then

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,570
cannot stop, just like
the flow of water.

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,680
In the same way, my
heart kept running

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,710
on the paths of hatred,
sorrow, anger and sadness.

9
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,660
It kept stumbling.

10
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,540
The way a dam stops
water from flowing

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,710
in the same way,
one's thought process

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,540
can be stopped due to
a single incident.

13
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,600
When there was no news of
Pandu from the battlefield

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,740
my thought process stopped
as is due to a dam.

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,630
The negative thoughts stopped.

16
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,670
My worry for Pandu

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,610
stopped my mind from travelling
the path of hatred and anger.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,700
I understood that

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,800
I was unfortunate

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,540
and no one has
conspired against me.

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,530
I was unjust with
Pandu, Gandhari.

22
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,510
When I understood that,
I realized

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,700
that I was unjust to you too.

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,540
I had rejected you, Gandhari.

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
If I realize my mistake

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,470
would you accept me?

27
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,610
My heart is overflowing
with happiness today.

28
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,470
Now that I have shown
my weaknesses to you

29
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,540
I feel relived.

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,510
So what if I couldn't
become the king?

31
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,600
Here, I am respected and
honoured more than a king.

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,580
When you gift me with
a son in the future

33
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,570
he will be the eldest in the
next generation of the Kurus.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,640
He will become the king.

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,580
He will become the heir to
the throne after Pandu.

36
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,540
I will feel like I was
enthroned, Gandhari.

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,510
Will you gift me with
such an able son?

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,340
Yes, Lord.

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,580
To fulfil your wishes

40
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,570
I can even go
to the God of death.

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,340
When it's time

42
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,340
we will together go to
the God of death, Gandhari.

43
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,570
We still have to lead
a happy life, don't we?

44
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,370
Stop!

45
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,530
Lord, look at that.

46
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,530
It's such a beautiful animal.

47
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,530
It's absolutely unusual.

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Please bring me its skin
for my throne.

49
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,380
No! We cannot kill a deer
for no reason.

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
If the deer has fawns

51
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,440
they may turn into orphans.

52
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,500
Its usual for fawns
to turn into orphans.

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,380
What's so unusual
about it, Lord?

54
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,310
I want the animal.

55
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,380
Lord, wouldn't you fulfil
your wife's simple wish?

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I'm not asking you
to crown me the queen.

57
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,300
I'm just asking for a deer.

58
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,500
Madri, you should open your
mouth to speak good things

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,340
not bitter things.

60
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,510
I will bring the deer for you.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,500
All of you, wait here.

62
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,410
Madri.

63
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,240
To kill an animal for no reason

64
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,330
isn't right.

65
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,470
Kshatriyas are used
to killing animals.

66
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,500
But you may not understand that.

67
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,270
Weren't you born into
the Yadav clan, sister?

68
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,270
And the Yadavs are
shepherds, aren't they?

69
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,230
No!

70
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
No!

71
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,280
Sage Kindam! Was that you?

72
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,110
Had you taken
the form of a deer?

73
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,110
What have you done?

74
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,110
You shot the arrow
without recognizing me.

75
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,080
I was dallying with my wife
in the form of a deer.

76
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,240
Fool!

77
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,070
In spite of seeing the deer's
appearance and grace

78
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,100
didn't you realize that it was
an unusual deer?

79
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Please forgive me, sage.

80
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,040
I have made
a grave mistake.

81
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,170
It isn't a mistake but a crime!

82
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,110
Imbecile! How could you
forget Dasharath's* fate?
*Father of Rama who killed a boy, mistaking him to be a deer, and cursed by the boy's blind parents.

83
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,270
Did you forget

84
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,170
that he had made
the same mistake?

85
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,040
He had to repent
for it all his life.

86
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,070
What kind of
a human being are you?

87
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,040
What kind of a king are you?

88
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,300
How will a cruel king like you
bring welfare to his subjects?

89
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,300
You too have to
suffer a punishment.

90
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,070
You have disturbed the intimacy
between a man and his wife.

91
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,070
I curse you!

92
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,040
If you cohabit with a woman...

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,100
If you establish a conjugal
relationship with her

94
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,170
you will be dead!

95
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,910
"Greetings!"

96
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
"I greet the King!"

97
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,810
"May there be happiness"

98
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,710
"with the queen mother,
Bhishma and the ministers!"

99
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,840
"Greetings!"

100
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,880
"Dhundhumali the imbecile has
many doubts in his heart."

101
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,750
"The doubts dance on
my head like spirits."

102
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,680
"Dhundhumali, what is
your question? Ask us."

103
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,940
"Should I?
Answer this."

104
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,750
"He is the master
and also the slave."

105
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,720
"He rests and also travels."

106
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,940
"He is freedom
and restriction too."

107
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,710
"All are fascinated by him."

108
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,720
"Tell me. Who is it?"

109
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,810
"Come on, tell me.
- Life!"

110
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,880
"There is no rest in life.
- A wife!"

111
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,770
"There is no freedom
from a wife."

112
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
"A son."

113
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,770
"Perfect!
Well done, sire."

114
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,650
"Now, the second question."

115
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,750
"What is superior to knowledge?
It is always constant."

116
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,720
"The experts surrender
before it."

117
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,770
"All the pleasures
accumulated together."

118
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,910
"Come on, tell me.
Speak up!"

119
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,700
"What is it?"

120
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
"Devotion."

121
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,680
"Experience."

122
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,870
"Foolishness."

123
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
"No!"

124
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
" Love . "

125
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,680
"Wonderful!
That was perfect, sire!"

126
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,880
"And now, the third question."

127
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,780
"A forehead like the sun,
his shoulders broad enough"

128
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,750
"he has strong insights"

129
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,840
"he is an epitome
of righteousness."

130
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
"Tell me."

131
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,750
"Come on, tell me.
Who is it?"

132
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,770
"My elder brother,
prince Dhritarashtra!"

133
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,770
"Perfect, minister."

134
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,680
"And now, the last question."

135
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,840
"The one who answers it,
will be proven intelligent."

136
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,610
"In the four answers"

137
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,680
"lies some good news."

138
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,620
"If you answer the question,
I would agree"

139
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,710
"this a court of brilliant men."

140
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,580
"What happened, Vidur?"

141
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,780
"What is the clown saying?"

142
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,810
"Brother"

143
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,770
"I have three answers."

144
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,580
"Son, love and
prince Dhritarashtra!"

145
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,550
"It means, he is trying to say"

146
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,680
"that you will achieve the love
of a son very soon, brother!"

147
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,510
The king has arrived on
a very auspicious occasion.

148
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,570
Greetings, Queen Mother.

149
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,570
Welcome, Pandu.

150
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,550
Look at the games
played by time.

151
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,510
To be a part of a happy
event in our family

152
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,520
you have returned before time.

153
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,740
Gandhari is expecting.

154
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,520
Dhritarashtra's first son
will be born very soon.

155
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
'I curse you!'

156
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,550
'If you establish a conjugal
relationship with a woman'

157
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,640
'you will be dead!'

158
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,610
Pandu

159
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,640
I hope you have understood
the news.

160
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,670
You don't look pleased at all.

161
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,570
Yes, Queen Mother.

162
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,480
Just like grief, happiness
also stops the brain

163
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,540
from functioning at times.

164
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,550
Brother, I am
extremely happy.

165
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,450
Brother, my hearty
congratulations to you!

166
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,540
'What kind of a king are you?'

167
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,610
'How will a cruel king like you
bring welfare to his subjects?'

168
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,410
Queen Mother, I have to announce
something important.

169
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,380
I killed sage Kindam
in the forest!

170
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,420
I am no longer worthy of
ruling a kingdom, Queen Mother.

171
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,750
I have killed sage Kindam!

172
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,650
I am no longer worthy of
ruling a kingdom, Queen Mother.

173
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,950
So, I have decided

174
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,750
that from this very moment

175
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,850
I renounce the throne
of Hastinapur!

176
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,590
Greetings, uncle.
- May you live long.

177
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,780
Lord Vishnu

178
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,650
made eight elephants stand
facing the eight directions

179
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,810
and gave them the responsibility
of all the three realms

180
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,680
the sky, the earth
and the heavens.

181
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,690
I hope you know that.

182
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,710
It was a very honourable
thing for them.

183
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,620
And they are restricted
by the same.

184
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,720
Pandu, think about this.

185
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,820
If one of the eight elephants

186
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,560
filled with grief and remorse,
like you

187
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,680
decides to withdraw from his
responsibilities

188
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,590
what would happen?

189
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,710
The entire creation would
be destroyed.

190
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,620
No, uncle.

191
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,780
Lord Vishnu will appoint some
other animal to bear the burden

192
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,620
of the three worlds.

193
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,620
The universe cannot be destroyed
because of one entity

194
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,660
and neither would the
kingdom of Hastinapur

195
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,620
be destroyed if I left.

196
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,710
Hastinapur will
not be destroyed.

197
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,790
But the happiness
of your Queen Mother

198
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,690
and your uncle's peace would
surely be destroyed, dear.

199
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,620
The Queen Mother has waited
for 25 years.

200
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,780
It's her right to see

201
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,620
a worthy king seated
on the throne of Hastinapur.

202
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,490
But, uncle. I am no
longer worthy.

203
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,750
I am no longer worthy.

204
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,680
I have committed
a grave sin, uncle.

205
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,660
Kripacharya and Vidur have
given you a remedy to it.

206
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,490
Donate cows,
offer prayers.

207
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,490
You should fast and abstain.

208
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
Uncle, that would be deceit.

209
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,710
It would be like
deceiving myself.

210
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,520
When Lord Indra killed a sage

211
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,510
he had renounced his kingdom.

212
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,480
He had renounced heaven.

213
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,460
He had meditated for several
years on a lotus stem.

214
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,590
When the King of Gods couldn't
wash his sins away so easily...

215
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,680
I am a mere human being.

216
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,710
How would my sins
be washed away

217
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,680
through charity and abstinence?

218
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,720
But, dear...
- Don't stop me, uncle.

219
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,690
The one who holds the sceptre

220
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,650
is called the king.

221
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,550
To give justice to everyone
and do justice with everyone

222
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,420
is the duty of a king, uncle.

223
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,490
If a king commits a crime

224
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,650
who will mete out
his punishment, uncle?
