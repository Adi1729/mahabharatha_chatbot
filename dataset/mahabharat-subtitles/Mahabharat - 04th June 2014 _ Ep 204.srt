1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,300
This is

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,370
a different circumstances.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,380
How does the current situation
any different, mother?

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,140
Sons,

5
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,300
King of Anga...

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,310
Karna, King of Anga...

7
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,280
Karna, King of Anga...

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,210
Karna, King of Anga has

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,140
showed the largest examples
involved in charity.

10
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,210
He gave away

11
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,210
part of his own body as a charity.

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,340
He gave away his shield as a charity.

13
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,370
As a warrior he is worthy to die on
the battlefield

14
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,140
and not in the camp of treatment.

15
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,080
Moreover, a better chance to slay him

16
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,270
now rest with Arjun.

17
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,140
If King of Anga die for what 
he thinks is right

18
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,050
then he will not be punished for
his improper conduct,

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,200
Nakula.

20
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,240
Mother's right.

21
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,210
Nakul, Sahadev

22
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,300
you two have to go to the rescue
King of Anga life's.

23
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,240
But brother Yudhishthir

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,210
we also need to go to welcome
uncle Shalya.

25
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,200
This is more important,
Sahadev.

26
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,010
King of Madra

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,070
will be welcomed in Kurukshetra by me.

28
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,170
Greetings, King Shalya.

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,180
Who had set up camp in the middle
of the road?

30
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,130
Who holds such important

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,040
that the road to the main camp has
been hampered?!

32
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,140
In order to welcome you, we do not
just block the road

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
but also holds our breath, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,130
And in this war

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,970
if you help us by agreeing to fight
for our side

36
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,010
it will be like the help of Lord
Shiva himself

37
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,170
Majesty.

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,080
This way, Majesty.

39
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,980
Where are my nephews, 
Nakul and Sahadev?

40
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,970
All hail King Shalya!

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,910
All hail King Shalya!

42
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,950
All hail King Shalya!

43
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,170
Majesty, all the princes are busy
preparing for war.

44
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,070
They are here at Kurukshetra.

45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,080
They may not have time.

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,040
Your Majesty, we are here 
to welcome you.

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,170
The king is here?

48
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,110
Where is he? 
- He's in the camp.

49
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,010
He has been waiting for you,
Majesty.

50
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,100
This way, Majesty.

51
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,110
All hail King Shalya!

52
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,970
All hail King Shalya!

53
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,000
Son!

54
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,940
Prince Nakula,

55
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,940
Prince Sahadev,

56
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,900
I bow before your knowledge.

57
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,970
Our holy herbs can not cure our
enemies more than this.

58
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,850
We will soon be venerating your corpse

59
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,740
Karna, King of Anga.

60
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,710
Mother,

61
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,740
let's go.

62
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,930
We must proceed towards our camp.

63
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,770
No, sons.

64
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,880
Until I live

65
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,800
I stayed in the camp of
Hastinapur, sons.

66
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,970
Mother,

67
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,900
if you stay with the enemy

68
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
you may then live in danger during
the war.

69
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,810
It is not right to trust the enemy
under any circumstances.

70
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,680
Do not worry, Prince Sahadev.

71
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,730
Just like a son

72
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,770
I will protect your mother.

73
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,670
Mother,

74
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,880
before the war's started, we will come 
to seek your blessings.

75
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,670
Let us go, Nakula.

76
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,870
Uncle Shalya must have arrived.

77
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,610
Uncle!

78
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,570
Uncle,

79
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,680
this is not our camp.

80
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,710
This camp belongs to our enemy.

81
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,640
I'm sorry, my dear nephews

82
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,670
but now, even I is an enemy to you.

83
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,680
This evil man

84
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,610
son of Dhritarashtra is just a wily fox who

85
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,640
have deceived me!

86
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,770
He made me to promise to help them,
dear nephews.

87
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,740
Making you promise!

88
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,670
But why did you make a promise
like that, uncle?!

89
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,510
What situation could it be

90
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,740
that you make a promise like that?!

91
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,740
I thought King Yudhishthira was welcoming me

92
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,740
and their praises left me blind.

93
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,540
Unknowingly

94
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,740
I promise to give them my help.

95
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,710
I was bound by my promise,
dear nephews.

96
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,710
And now, I have to fight along with
these evil people!

97
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,680
All around the world a brother

98
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,610
assume their sibling's children

99
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,610
equivalent to hundreds of 'Brahmin!'

100
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,570
Then how can you leave

101
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,600
your sister's children, uncle?

102
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,700
For me, the two of you more than 
my own children.

103
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,500
Sahadev,

104
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Nakula,

105
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,540
my prayers will always be with 
the Pandavas.

106
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,540
But I am helpless in this case.

107
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,670
That wicked Duryodhana

108
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,600
has shown that low values

109
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,600
are part of himself!

110
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,700
His blind father

111
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,410
only worthy for

112
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,550
begging outside the temple!

113
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,540
And these are the values given 
by their mother

114
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,600
to these devils!

115
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,800
His blind father

116
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,860
only worthy for

117
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,640
begging outside the temple!

118
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,860
And these are the values given 
by their mother

119
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,630
to these devils!

120
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,730
King Shalya! 
- My dear!

121
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,700
Stay within your limits!

122
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,610
Calm, my dear.

123
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,600
Relax.

124
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,800
King Shalya

125
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,770
using derogatory words like that

126
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,740
for my brother-in-law and sister

127
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,830
is unlike people like you.

128
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,570
Are you angry, Shakuni?!

129
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,630
You deceitful man!

130
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,690
Come forward

131
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,700
and let us have a duel here!

132
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,540
No, King of Madra.

133
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,660
I'm not your lover

134
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,800
that your sour words

135
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
would hurt my heart.

136
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,570
There will be a duel...

137
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,630
You will be involved in a duel

138
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,500
with your two nephews

139
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,730
on the battlefield.

140
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,540
I am going to have a duel with you!

141
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,500
And I will slay you, uncle Shalya.

142
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,540
I will kill you for this betrayal.

143
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,640
And uncle Shakuni

144
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,600
this scam must be yours.

145
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,470
So remember this oath,

146
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,440
you will be killed in this war!

147
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,600
And it will be in my hand!

148
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,540
Let's go, Nakul!

149
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,530
Whether King of Madra will be
punished or not

150
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,640
is not an important thing, Nakula.

151
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,460
At this time

152
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,610
we can not get angry or 
think about revenge.

153
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,500
We only have seven 'akshauhini' army

154
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,410
while they have eleven 
great 'akshauhini' army!

155
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,500
This problem is more important.

156
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,540
We must have someone who can help
in the beginning.

157
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,430
Grandsire Bhisma

158
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,400
Guru Drona

159
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,390
King of Anga

160
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,470
Crown Prince Duryodhana

161
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,330
Susharma

162
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,590
and now

163
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,370
even the King of Madra.

164
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,370
When all of these soldiers

165
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,440
wreak havoc on our troops

166
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,300
that our soldiers' Maharathis

167
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,430
will be completely absorbed in
protecting our troops.

168
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,310
We will not even get a chance to
attack.

169
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,360
If you all

170
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,370
remove yourself from the attachment

171
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,470
anger and fear

172
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,400
and fight with all your heart

173
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,430
for the establishment of truth

174
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,360
then, have faith that

175
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,300
our army will stand without 
we even notice it.

176
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,390
The strength of a maharathi

177
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,370
rest in his heart

178
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,330
and not in the strength of his army.

179
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,340
In order to win in this war

180
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,240
praying for the death of 
his excellency Bhisma

181
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,300
is your duty.

182
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,780
In order to win in this war

183
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,010
praying for the death of 
his excellency Bhisma

184
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,780
is your duty.

185
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,910
His excellency's death?

186
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,750
But... 
- But what, friend?

187
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,940
His excellency is Kaurava 
army general.

188
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
Protecting the Crown Prince
Duryodhana of Hastinapura

189
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,940
is an oath he had taken.

190
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,820
Until he continues to fight 
in this war

191
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,710
our victory is impossible.

192
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,750
You have taken an oath to
establish truth,

193
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,840
and sacrifice

194
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,810
is the primary basis of truth.

195
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
And more important than life

196
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,780
is sacrificing it.

197
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,780
And sacrifice of love and
affection

198
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,870
which seems to be more important
than life itself

199
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,780
is very important.
