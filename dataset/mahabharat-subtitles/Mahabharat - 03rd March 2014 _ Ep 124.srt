1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,260
Lord Indra is your
biological father.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,190
Will you be able to fight him?

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,330
The 'Vedas' say

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,320
that the might of Lord Indra

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,420
can be matched by only one God.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,260
Agni Dev.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,190
Agni Dev is termed as the
face of the Gods.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,290
Today, I shall pray to Agni Dev

9
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,300
to have the love of my father.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,200
And if I am unable
to have his love

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,390
then I would rather die!

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,160
But such an enormous forest

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,360
cannot be destroyed.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,190
To chop down a tree

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,260
is far more grave a sin
than killing 100 humans.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,290
Do not worry,
Panchali.

17
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,380
I shall pray to Agni Dev*
*God of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices.

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,400
to prey on only the illusions
of Mayasur.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,390
I will ask him not to
harm the trees.

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,130
The illusion of Mayasur
is very powerful, Arjun.

21
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,090
Can it be destroyed?

22
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,390
Brother Bheem

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,160
Agni Dev is also called
the devourer.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,130
Agni Dev can devour anything.

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,250
Even the illusion of Mayasur

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,350
will be devoured by him.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,390
But ensure that he does not
devour the serpents, Arjun.

28
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,090
In order to save the humans

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,260
if we kill the serpents

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,350
then it would be unrighteous.

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Lord of the Serpents,
there is still time.

32
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,190
Go and seek the refuge
of the Pandavas.

33
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,150
Mayasur, if you

34
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,030
had not transformed this forest

35
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,120
into an illusory one
and helped me

36
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,130
then I

37
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,160
would have bitten you
this instant.

38
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,120
And the one I bite

39
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,160
can not

40
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,150
be helped by anyone.

41
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,990
Son of Pandu,
Arjun.

42
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,890
Do not cross your limits.

43
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,960
I protect this forest.

44
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,120
Lord Indra

45
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,890
you protect

46
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,020
the entire world!

47
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,090
Yet, according to their needs,
competent warriors

48
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,900
make use of the earth.

49
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,060
Then why can we not,
Lord Indra?

50
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,960
Because I protect the serpents
of this forest!

51
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,900
These serpents have
committed the crime

52
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,990
of biting innocent people!

53
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,850
And protecting the culprits

54
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,000
does not befit the Gods,
Lord Indra!

55
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
Arjun!

56
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,020
Do not preach me
about righteousness.

57
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,990
When compared to me

58
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,990
you are only a child.

59
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,050
I am your child,
Lord Indra.

60
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,090
And the child sitting
on his father's shoulders

61
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,960
has a better vision
than his father!

62
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,020
Arjun!

63
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,990
Go away from here

64
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,890
otherwise you shall
meet your doom!

65
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,060
My life is a gift from you,
Lord Indra.

66
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
I would be blessed

67
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,890
if you gift me death as well!

68
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,020
But by laying down my weapons

69
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,960
I cannot tarnish
your reputation.

70
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,980
Arjun!

71
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,730
My foolish subjects!

72
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,660
Stop! Consuming
rodents as a meal

73
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,600
has left all of you
with a similar disposition!

74
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,850
Stop!

75
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,790
Who are you scared of?

76
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,660
No one can defeat us!
Stop!

77
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,760
Lord Indra

78
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,820
use your 'vajra!'*
*A club with a ribbed spherical head, symbolize both the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force).

79
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,690
You must keep

80
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,600
the promise you made!

81
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,690
Where are you going,
Mayasur?!

82
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,800
After spending

83
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,700
many joyful years in my refuge

84
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,690
you are abandoning me now?!

85
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,750
Dakshak

86
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,600
I had made a deal with you.

87
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,630
It was an exchange of benefits.

88
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,650
But this is a mortal trouble.

89
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,660
Neither can you protect me
nor can I protect you.

90
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,730
I am now going to seek
the refuge of the Pandavas.

91
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,420
Arjuna!
- Brother!

92
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,680
Lord Indra!

93
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,160
I am your son

94
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,480
and an ardent follower

95
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,400
of Lord Kartikeya*
*The god of war, the commander-in-chief of the army of the devas (gods) and the son of Shiva and Parvati.

96
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,560
who is the husband
of your daughter Devsena!

97
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,840
I will not get defeated
so easily.

98
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,800
I will not be defeated,
Lord Indra.

99
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,720
Lord Indra...

100
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
It's not a contest to test yours
and Arjuna's potential.

101
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,560
Arjuna is merely asking you
to spare our subjects' lives.

102
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,600
He is not trying to insult you.

103
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,240
Please do not show the Vajra
but clemency, My Lord.

104
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,560
O divine weapon Vajra!

105
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,320
Please accept my greetings.

106
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,360
Please show respect
to my divine weapon

107
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,600
and calm down.
