1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,480
This is 'Lakshagraha.'

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,320
A 'yajna' will be
conducted there. A 'yajna!'

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,180
And in that 'yajna'

4
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,380
that palace will be used
as the sacrifice, friend.

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,410
And my enemies

6
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,220
will burn to ashes
in that 'yajna!'

7
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,250
Not only your enemies,
Prince Duryodhan

8
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,380
but also the competence
of this friend of yours

9
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,320
your respect,
the glory of your ancestors

10
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,150
and even the righteousness
of Hastinapur

11
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,290
will burn to ashes.

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
What are you saying, friend?

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,160
Why are you unhappy
on this joyous occasion?

14
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
Pardon me, Prince Duryodhan

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,160
but it will be a truly
joyous occasion for me

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,190
when my arrows will crush
the head of my enemy

17
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,310
and my enemy's arrows will
cut right through my chest.

18
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,120
Beheading an enemy
who is sleeping

19
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,310
is like chopping down the tree
of righteousness, friend.

20
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,190
This is the difference between

21
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,190
a murderer and a hero.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,150
Righteousness?

23
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,150
Righteousness!

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,180
Do not ramble on about
righteousness, King of Anga.

25
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,280
There is only one form of
righteousness in the world...

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Victory!

27
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,290
Because only victors
create history.

28
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,090
And the traditions
mentioned in history

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,120
assume the form of righteousness
down the road.

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,050
Lie!

31
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,150
Righteousness is something

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,120
that nurtures the possibilities
and capabilities of a person.

33
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,020
Any task that weakens
the soul of man

34
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,180
cannot be righteousness, friend.

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,220
In other words, do you have
a soft corner for the Pandavas

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,090
now, King of Anga?

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,250
King of Anga, did you forget

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,190
who made you King?

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Foolish Dusshasan!
Be quiet!

40
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,120
My friend

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
is correct.

42
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,180
If any task of mine
is hurting my friend

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
then I shall not perform it.

44
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,180
Have Purochan
informed right away!

45
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,950
The plan has been cancelled!

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,150
Brother Duryodhan...
- No more arguments!

47
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,160
The plan has been cancelled.

48
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,180
Friend Karna

49
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,080
your happiness is more
valuable to me.

50
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,060
If you do not want me
to become the Crown Prince

51
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,050
and the King in the future

52
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,010
then I shall

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,920
renounce my royal life.

54
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,890
I desire to make you a glorious
emperor, Prince Duryodhan.

55
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,910
I am against deception.
I am not against a battle.

56
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,050
Battle? With whom shall
I engage in a battle?

57
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,080
With my father?

58
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,910
With my grandsire?

59
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,050
With my uncle Vidur?

60
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,890
Even if I win in that situation

61
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,890
it will be deemed
my defeat, friend.

62
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,850
In the battle,
will I behead my father

63
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,890
or will he behead me, friend?

64
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,890
Just answer this question
of mine, friend.

65
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,050
They have deceived us.

66
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,820
They are the unrighteous ones,
friend Karna.

67
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,820
They have given rise
to such a situation, friend

68
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,860
where I will have to either
resort to unrighteousness

69
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,850
OT

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Give up my right.

71
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,990
Friend Karna

72
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,960
the way a person who
snatches the right of another

73
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,850
is sentenced to a life in hell

74
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,890
similarly, falling prey
to weakness

75
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,920
a person who gives up
his right is also

76
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,820
sentenced to a life
in hell, friend.

77
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,820
Pertaining to the topic
of Duryodhan's right

78
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,910
if you have any doubt,
King of Anga

79
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,850
then do speak up now.

80
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,990
No.

81
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,910
I do not doubt it.

82
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,710
Then do show me the way, friend.

83
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,750
Show me the middle path.

84
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,700
Do come back soon, Kunti.

85
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,510
I shall await you.

86
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,470
Certainly, sister-in-law.

87
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,730
Goodbye, brother-in-law.

88
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,730
Bless you.

89
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,530
Goodbye, Her Highness.

90
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,540
Goodbye.

91
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,540
Goodbye, uncle.
- May you live long.

92
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,670
May you live long.
Yudhishthir

93
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,570
one must never impede
the journey of a pilgrim.

94
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,570
That is why,
I am not stopping you.

95
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,640
But the decision of
staying out of Hastinapur

96
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,530
is not a very wise one
at the moment.

97
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,600
All of you

98
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,570
need to be back soon.

99
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
Certainly, grandsire.

100
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,440
Staying away from Hastinapur
for too long

101
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,470
will not be easy for us either.

102
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,480
My concern for this place
will keep me wide awake.

103
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,500
Your departure
will rob Hastinapur

104
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,530
of its prosperity, My Lady.

105
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Goodbye, brother.

106
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,380
You need not worry
one bit for Hastinapur.

107
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,430
No, Duryodhan.

108
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,340
I am not worried
about Hastinapur.

109
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,340
The Almighty himself chalks out
the happiness of subjects.

110
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,480
One needs to worry about people

111
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
because the Almighty
protects a person only when

112
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,500
he upholds righteousness.

113
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,460
In other words

114
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,370
we are worried about you,
Duryodhan.

115
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,340
Very soon

116
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,270
the reason of your worry

117
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,530
will come to an end,
brother Bheem.

118
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,270
Be happy.

119
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,530
May glory be yours.

120
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,600
King of Anga

121
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,600
may you never deter from
the path of righteousness.

122
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,530
This is the only blessing
I can give you.

123
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,530
Unrighteousness is like mercury

124
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,500
that robs gold of its lustre.

125
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,300
'Dwaraka.'

126
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,140
In such a short time span

127
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,380
I have acquired so much
from you, Madhav.

128
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,070
The one who has the
mental state to grasp things

129
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,020
only he can acquire
something, friend.

130
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,080
You will come across the
Triveni Confluence on your way.

131
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,280
Do bathe in it.

132
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,030
There

133
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,480
lies the Lost River Saraswati.

134
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,720
While bathing

135
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,800
do think of the tale of
Goddess Saraswati getting lost

136
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,200
in that river.

137
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,300
But I have not
heard of this tale.

138
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,320
It is said that
Goddess Saraswati

139
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,600
could not walk on earth bearing
the holy fire on her palm.

140
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,920
That is why

141
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,680
she began migrating
into the earth.

142
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,880
If you think of this tale
while bathing

143
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,840
you will earn
good fortune, friend.

144
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,000
As you say.
