1
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,200
'My son is innocent.'

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,130
'Had you been confident
about his innocence'

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,090
'that would have been heard
in your voice, your majesty!'

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,260
'You have to do justice,
your majesty.'

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,170
'The way Pandu's sons don't have
the protection of their father

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,030
'in the same way'

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,200
'you will have to stop
protecting your sons.'

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,030
'Your sons will study

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,260
at Drona's hermitage
for 12 years.'

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,140
'And in these twelve years'

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,000
'you will not try to contact
your sons in anyway.'

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,000
Father.
Father!

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,780
What is this I hear?

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,240
I have been ordered to go
to the hermitage... - Quiet!

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,130
Learn to seek my permission
before entering my chambers.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,130
Father?

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,960
Yes, I order you to go
and stay at Guru Drona's

18
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,160
hermitage along with
your brothers.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
On the banks of the
river Rishabh

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,100
miles away from Hastinapur.

21
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,930
There you will concentrate
on your studies.

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,200
You will follow the
orders of your Guru.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,040
And you will be kind to
Pandu's sons.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,190
But why are you abandoning
me like this?

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,190
At least tell me the reason.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
Because that is a
tradition, son.

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,970
Your arrogance

28
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,130
and to bring your contemptuous
behaviour back to the

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,190
path of righteousness

30
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,990
this is the only solution
I have, son.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,930
But father, what arrogance
have I shown?

32
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,970
I always try to fulfill
your wishes.

33
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,930
And don't you want
me to be your heir?

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
That someday I should become
the king of the Kuru dynasty.

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,030
How dare you question me!

36
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,970
Whatever you did to
Pandu's son Bheem

37
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,920
was that my wish?

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,870
But, he is an enemy, father.

39
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,070
All of them have come here to
stop your wishes

40
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,030
from being fulfilled.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,090
This is the way one should
behave with his enemies.

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,900
Enemy?

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,990
Had I told you that Pandu's
sons are your enemies?

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,060
Father, you were the
one to say that.

45
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,000
You had said
that life means ambitions.

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,990
Our dreams are the
assets of our life.

47
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,970
Whoever becomes an obstacle in

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,990
the path of achieving
our desires

49
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,070
it's our duty to eliminate them.

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,040
Father, I did as you said.

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,870
How am I at fault then?

52
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,830
Fault...

53
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,960
I do not know
what is your fault.

54
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,800
I only know that

55
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,100
I may have given you
wrong advise.

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,870
To proceed towards the hermitage

57
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,870
is the only choice
you have, son.

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,830
So you must go.

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,800
Thus, go there

60
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,890
and use all your competence

61
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,970
to become worthy.

62
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,920
Go!

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,870
But, father...
- Go!

64
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,890
Leave.

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,700
Every child coming
into the world

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,830
is totally uncivilized.

67
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,700
His inner self has no
good values

68
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,890
nor vices.

69
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,700
It means, by birth

70
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,890
a child possesses no good
qualities or vices.

71
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,670
Then how do they attain
good qualities or vices?

72
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,770
Have we ever thought about it?

73
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,900
What they repeatedly
hear from their parents

74
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,830
children accept the
same as values.

75
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,890
Like

76
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,790
a road is formed to reach
the village river

77
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,770
only because people have been
repeatedly walking on it.

78
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,830
It means, the desires
of the parents

79
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,840
can develop as vices or good
qualities of their children.

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,900
Isn't that true?

81
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,900
Yet, when they see
vices in their children

82
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,900
the parents are astonished
and unhappy.

83
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,700
The parents ask themselves

84
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,760
where did their children
learn such immorality!

85
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,670
The truth is that, the
parents unknowingly

86
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,820
sow seeds of immorality
in their children

87
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,630
which develops

88
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,670
into a tree
of depravity in their heart.

89
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,630
It means, the parents

90
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,770
who desire to make
their children

91
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,700
virtuous and righteous
have to first

92
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,740
control their own desires.
Isn't it necessary?

93
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,830
All parents should
think about this.

94
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,760
Subjects present in the court

95
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,630
the new generation of
the Kuru dynasty

96
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,640
are today heading towards
the most important

97
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,730
phase of their life.

98
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,630
Among the four phases
mentioned in the scriptures

99
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,540
the most important is
the student life.

100
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,530
In the coming times

101
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,800
the happiness of the subjects

102
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,620
and peace

103
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,690
both depends on

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,670
the love for knowledge
of the students today

105
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,530
and their uprightness.

106
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,730
After twelve years

107
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,630
when the princes come back
after finishing their studies

108
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,530
they would be capable of
giving the great nation

109
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,570
administration, security
and justice.

110
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,740
They will return after
having gained such knowledge

111
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,760
and I believe in that.

112
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,500
Long live the princes of the
Kuru dynasty!

113
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,740
Long live the princes of the
Kuru dynasty!

114
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,660
Long live the princes of the
Kuru dynasty!

115
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,020
Prince Duryodhan.

116
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,060
Prince Yudhistir.

117
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,150
On behalf of all the princes
you will ask the king for

118
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,920
permission and advise.

119
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
The rest of the princes

120
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,060
will bid goodbye to
their respective mothers.

121
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,960
It's time to leave.

122
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Goodbye.

123
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,020
Bless you, dear.

124
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,860
Study well, dear.

125
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,020
Value the orders of
your Guru

126
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,950
more than you value
the orders of God.

127
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,900
You are wise, so I don't have
much to advise you.

128
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,020
Goodbye, father.

129
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,930
Bless you, son.

130
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,990
I have several ambitions

131
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,850
and dreams for you, my son.

132
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,830
Acquire knowledge

133
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,950
and come back soon to
prove your capability.

134
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,850
Hastinapur will be
waiting for you, son.

135
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,960
Goodbye.
- May you live long.

136
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,860
Goodbye.
- May you live long.

137
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,730
Your majesty...

138
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,830
Send off the children
with happiness and enthusiasm.

139
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,920
The children are leaving today.

140
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,790
They will return as radiant and
strong young men soon.

141
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,790
I am eagerly waiting
for the day

142
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,800
when my son, instead of
being guided by others

143
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,760
can determine a path for others.

144
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,730
The curd will make it
a happy journey

145
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,760
and the sugar will make
your journey sweet.

146
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,730
Bheem, extend your hand.

147
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,830
Mother, give it to my
younger brothers first.

148
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,660
Just a bit.

149
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,820
All three are kids.

150
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,760
It's not right for them
to eat too much.

151
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,820
It isn't right to waste
sweet curd.

152
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,760
Bheem.

153
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
Arjun.

154
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,730
Protecting your
younger brothers

155
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,620
is your responsibility.

156
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,690
Trust me, mother.

157
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,650
Now, I am stronger than Hanuman.

158
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,700
I will protect Nakul
and Sahadev.

159
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,850
But the question is

160
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,830
At times, Nakul talks a lot.

161
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,690
Who will protect me from him?

162
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Bheem, my brother,
you will do that.

163
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,750
Yes, it's true.

164
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,590
I can protect myself from you.

165
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,820
It is a bit difficult.
I am very strong.

166
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,750
My sons, it's time to leave.

167
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,790
Be successful
is your mothers blessing.

168
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,790
I will be worried for you.

169
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,370
Mother.

170
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,400
Father always said

171
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,470
whatever we do, we
should give it our best.

172
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,330
I will always follow his advise.

173
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,310
I will surely acquire the
best of knowledge.

174
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,270
And with my archery skills

175
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,470
I will always protect
my brothers.

176
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,340
Son, I have full faith in you.

177
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,210
Go.

178
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,110
Look!
Looks like uncle

179
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,230
has made arrangements
for us to rest.

180
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,010
Come.
