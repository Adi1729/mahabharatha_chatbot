1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,290
I banish you and your family
from the kingdom this instant!

2
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,320
Leave Hastinapur
at the earliest!

3
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,030
You are banishing us...

4
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,230
Uncle

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,190
what crime are you
punishing us for?

6
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,030
Crime?!

7
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,060
You have come to this court
after committing a grave sin

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,060
Yudhishthir

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,030
and yet you ask me
what your crime is?!

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,020
The soul of my beloved
younger brother Pandu

11
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,150
must be crying bitterly
in the heavens today!

12
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,250
My ancestors must be hurt
and ashamed because of you!

13
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,200
Our deed is no sin, uncle.

14
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,960
The chaste daughter
of the Great Sage Kandu

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,990
Marisha, had married
ten Prachetas.

16
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,990
Marisha had given birth
to Prajapati Daksh, uncle.

17
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,960
And that is what led to
the genesis of the creation.

18
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,060
Had marrying more than
one man been a sin

19
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,020
the entire human race

20
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,990
would have been deemed
the fruit of that sin, uncle.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Sins and merits do not
depend upon a deed.

22
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,030
The intention behind the deed...

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,960
Was it righteous or devious...

24
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,960
Sins and merits depend upon
the intention behind the deed.

25
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,990
But the ones who see deviousness
as the source of merits...

26
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,050
How can such people have the
intelligence to understand sins?

27
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,120
Brother Duryodhan

28
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,990
an elephant
putting dirt on its head

29
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,990
should not be deemed
a devious behaviour.

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,160
In order to rid itself
of parasites

31
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,960
it engages in such
an unusual behaviour.

32
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,020
Man also comes across situations

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,990
where resorting
to atypical solutions

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
is the only way out.

35
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,930
Grandsire Bhishma
has also accepted

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,030
that our deed
is a righteous one.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,920
Grandsire

38
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,820
I request you

39
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,980
to say something.

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,920
Your Highness

41
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,020
the situation that arose
in Kampilya...

42
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
I gathered information about it.

43
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,020
Then I discussed it with Vidur.

44
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,990
After scrutinizing it
from every possible angle

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,060
and in order to solve
this peculiar problem

46
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,060
by also looking into
other possible alternatives

47
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,820
they took this decision.

48
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,920
This decision of theirs

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,990
has the support of
the Great Sage Vyas.

50
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,860
This is an unrighteous deed

51
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,820
Yet

52
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,850
the sons of Pandu
and the Princess of Panchal

53
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,920
are guiltless.

54
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,920
We must accept their marriage.

55
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,860
Under no circumstance

56
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,790
will I accept it,
great Bhishma!

57
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,820
The words of a person
and the decision of a King

58
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,950
are two different things, uncle!

59
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,660
Irrespective of what an esteemed
person of a society says

60
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,820
rules are made by
the ruler of a kingdom

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,920
only after considering
all the strata of the society

62
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,660
including the most destitute,
ignorant and inferior, uncle!

63
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,660
And I am the King of Hastinapur.

64
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,790
I, Dhritarashtra, am the King
of the Kuru dynasty.

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,750
Any deed that encourages
wrong doers in the future

66
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,820
cannot be accepted by me, uncle.

67
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,830
I do not accept it
under any circumstance!

68
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
Your Highness

69
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,690
we five brothers and our wife

70
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,660
are ready to walk through a pyre

71
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,590
before the entire society
to prove our innocence!

72
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,820
Even the wrong doers
of the society will know

73
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,820
that after committing a deed
that seems unrighteous

74
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,760
they too will have to
walk through a pyre.

75
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,620
And Your Highness

76
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,760
poisoning a child and then
throwing him in the river

77
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,660
before letting a warrior
reach the arena

78
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,630
attempting to kill him
under a debris of rocks

79
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,700
and conspiring to kill family

80
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
by burning them in a palace
made of lac and clarified butter

81
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,750
are also deeds

82
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,650
which can encourage wrong doers.

83
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,720
If one continues committing
such deeds, Your Highness

84
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,630
then the throne of Hastinapur

85
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,550
will be left with no heir!

86
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,550
Your Highness!

87
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,730
Your Highness

88
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,530
I had pleaded to you
last night itself

89
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,560
to give my nephews,
my darlings

90
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,690
the permission to go to Gandhar
with me and settle there.

91
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,490
Your Highness,
your nephews and mine

92
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,690
cannot reside
in the same kingdom.

93
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,450
First, they commit such a
grave unrighteous deed

94
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,560
and to top it all,
they are accusing people!

95
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,590
Shame on them!

96
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,600
Uncle is correct, father.

97
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,590
What else can these people do?

98
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,530
A woman who has
relationships with five men

99
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
can neither know
what righteousness is

100
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,500
nor can she teach it
to her husbands.

101
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,660
Brother Duryodhan!

102
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,490
The one who insulted Panchali

103
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,490
shall be beheaded by me!
- Arjun!

104
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,430
Pardon me, Your Highness

105
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,420
but a person who does nothing
to defend his wife's honour

106
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,390
can only be a corpse!

107
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,260
He cannot be alive.
- Be quiet!

108
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,530
For taking to arms
in the royal court

109
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,230
I sentence you to death, Arjun!

110
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,450
You cannot sentence him
to death, Your Highness.

111
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,450
Your daughter-in-law

112
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,490
the future of this dynasty

113
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,260
the fortune of this lineage
was insulted by a person

114
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,230
but you did not sentence him
to death, Your Highness!

115
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,300
That is why, someone
who defends his wife's honour

116
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,260
cannot be sentenced to death
by you, Your Highness!

117
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,190
You can only

118
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,300
challenge him to a battle!

119
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,190
And I accept the challenge

120
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,190
to a battle!

121
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,400
To defend Draupadi's honour,
five formidable forces

122
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,370
the five Pandavas will rise
to the occasion, Duryodhan!

123
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,400
You will be annihilated!

124
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,420
Annihilated!

125
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,300
Stop!

126
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,530
Insulting the dynasty's
daughter-in-law

127
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,370
being unjust to the Crown Prince

128
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,270
creating an environment
of a battlefield in the court...

129
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,390
For how long will this
sacred court of Hastinapur

130
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,270
keep getting tainted
by your sons, Your Highness?!

131
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,320
My sons...

132
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,370
I cannot stay in this court
even a moment longer!

133
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,200
Your Highness

134
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,260
when a building
is feared to collapse

135
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,230
intelligent people

136
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,330
construct supportive structures
in it as a preventive measure.

137
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,170
I fear, Your Highness

138
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,390
that in order to protect
the Kuru dynasty

139
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,190
it is time now

140
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,130
to divide the kingdom.
