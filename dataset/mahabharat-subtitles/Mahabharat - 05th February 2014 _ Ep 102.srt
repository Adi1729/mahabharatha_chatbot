1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,380
I will not marry the son
of a charioteer.

2
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,200
Son of a charioteer!

3
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,280
Is this 'swayamvar' a test of
competence or caste and class?

4
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,310
It is matter of great surprise,
King Drupad

5
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,200
that your daughter
was reminded of my caste

6
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,200
when I was about
to achieve the goal.

7
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,110
It is evident that your daughter
does not want to marry me

8
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,280
but had she not ridiculed
my birth like this

9
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,330
had she not insulted my caste

10
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,170
the entire world would have
been proud of the Princess!

11
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,080
You daughter does not know,
Your Highness

12
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,040
that in this gathering here

13
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,180
she has not only insulted me

14
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,250
but also those
millions of people

15
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,300
whose competence is not
determined by their lineage

16
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,010
but labour and strength!

17
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,140
Your daughter has

18
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,270
has committed a grave sin,
Your Highness.

19
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,210
Committed a grave sin.

20
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,240
Keep quiet and return
to your place, King of Anga!

21
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,270
The decision to whom
to get married

22
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,110
and in which lineage and dynasty
to get married into

23
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,010
is a right that lies

24
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,110
solely with the maiden.

25
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
This is not a right, King Drupad

26
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,980
but the arrogance
of your daughter!

27
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,170
You have turned this 'swayamvar'
into politics, King Drupad.

28
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,980
We had thought

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,040
that to end the enmity
between Kuru and Panchal

30
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,250
you had invited us

31
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,080
but

32
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,080
you solely wanted to insult us!

33
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,170
That is a lie!

34
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,140
I have no knowledge
of any enmity, Prince.

35
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,050
If my intentions were not pure

36
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,010
then this instant

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,980
may Lord Surya burn me to ashes!

38
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,080
The 'swayamvar' of a Princess

39
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,050
is never open to beings of all
types and sections of society

40
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,080
Prince.

41
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,010
Otherwise do beings like, 'yaksh,* gandharva,'* ogres
*Fairy, nature-spirits; **Male nature spirits, part animal.

42
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,080
spirits, ghouls and others

43
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,040
not have the competence?

44
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
But none of them can come forth

45
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,910
and approach a Princess
for marriage.

46
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,040
Honouring the rules
of a 'swayamvar'

47
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,010
is the duty of everyone.

48
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,950
The truth is, by deciding to
participate in the 'swayamvar

49
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,980
King Karna of Anga has broken
the rules of this undertaking.

50
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,040
If this is what you think,
Princess Draupadi

51
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,970
then listen well to this.

52
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,970
I am challenging you

53
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,840
that if you are to get married

54
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,910
you must do so
in this very 'swayamvar'

55
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
that too with such a person

56
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,940
who emerges victorious here.

57
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,910
Take a look around you,
Princess Draupadi.

58
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,940
Is there anyone who can
achieve this goal?!

59
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,580
I am here.
Did I not tell you

60
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,640
that a person who is
fated to receive alms

61
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,580
reaches the destination somehow?

62
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,600
King Drupad,
there is no one here

63
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,650
who can take part
in this competition.

64
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,540
Is there anyone?
A Prince or a King...

65
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,740
Does anyone want to participate

66
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,750
in this facade
of a 'swayamvar?!'

67
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,610
Break that bow!

68
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,440
Destroy that goal, King Drupad!

69
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,630
And take your arrogant daughter

70
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,500
and imprison her in

71
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,530
the corner of a palace forever.
- Kuru Prince!

72
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,270
Prince Duryodhan

73
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
King Drupad is grateful to you

74
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,440
for attempting
to break that bow.

75
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,470
You have proved

76
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,300
that it is not yet time for
the bow to be destroyed.

77
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,390
Brother Yudhishthir

78
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,200
he is Vasudev.

79
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,200
You must be aware,
Crown Prince Duryodhan

80
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,310
that the bow of Lord Shiva
was built for many purposes

81
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,270
out of which one was

82
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,290
the 'swayamvar' of Goddess Sita.

83
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,370
Only after the completion
of that task

84
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,430
did that bow break.

85
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,270
This miraculous bow did not
break at your mighty hands

86
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,430
and that can mean
only one thing

87
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,470
that a warrior who can
win this competition

88
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,210
is still present here.

89
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,270
A warrior who can
win this competition

90
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,270
is still present here.

91
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
That is why

92
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,240
I request you,
Crown Prince Duryodhan

93
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,330
to allow this 'swayamvar'
to be completed.

94
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,240
Your Highness, address
all the Kings present here

95
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,330
for one last time.

96
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,210
I address this gathering
for one last time!

97
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,280
If a King, Crown Prince

98
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,340
or 'Kshatriya' warrior

99
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,280
wishes to demonstrate his might

100
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,170
then he must come forth!

101
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,260
Govind

102
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,280
can a 'Kshatriya' maiden

103
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
not get married to 'Brahmins?'

104
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,170
She most certainly can.

105
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,110
But only if you want to.

106
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,060
Yes, Govind.

107
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,230
Address the 'Brahmins'
this time.

108
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,230
I have firm faith

109
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
that my hidden fate

110
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,040
will appear before
the entire world today.

111
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,230
Your Highness

112
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,340
it is said in the 'shastras'*
*Scholar/sacred texts.

113
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
that when the might
of 'Kshatriyas' falls short

114
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,270
and the knowledge of the
'shastras' is inadequate

115
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,010
then one should turn to
'Brahmins' for answers.

116
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,130
King Gadhi's daughter* was married

117
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,030
to Sage Richika* and all of us know about it.
*Parashurama's grandparents.

118
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,110
Your Highness

119
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,130
address all the 'Brahmins'

120
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,170
and ask them to take part

121
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,940
in this competition.

122
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,000
But Vasudev

123
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,040
my daughter was born
to become a Queen.

124
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,040
Marrying a 'Brahmin'
and asking for alms

125
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,010
does not suit a Princess.

126
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,040
When a fruit gets buried
in the earth

127
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,860
it cuts through it
after some time

128
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,520
and grows into a tree.

129
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,880
If your daughter was born
to become a queen

130
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,800
then she might just
turn a 'Brahmin'

131
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,440
into a King.
