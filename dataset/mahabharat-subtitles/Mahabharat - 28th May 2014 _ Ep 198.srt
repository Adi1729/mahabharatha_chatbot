1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,910
Gather your weapons and courage

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,710
and be prepared to fight a war.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,390
We must improve the security
in Virat for this purpose.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,350
In order to harm
Panchali, Subhadra

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,510
or Uttara,
what if that wicked

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,430
and evil Duryodhan
sends someone to Virat?

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,350
That is not necessary,
My Lord.

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,270
We women of the Kuru dynasty

9
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,430
will reside
near the battlefield.

10
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,470
Taking care of the supplies
and tending to the injured

11
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,870
will be the responsibility
of us women.

12
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,790
And when you slay
Duryodhan and his brothers

13
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,750
my presence
will make him realize

14
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,470
that he is being punished

15
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,670
and that he is
not dying as a martyr.

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,990
This is how

17
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,390
I shall slay you,
Vasudev!

18
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,310
Friend Duryodhan.

19
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,550
What are you doing here?

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,310
Is this what you call
friendship?

21
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,110
When that Vasudev was
insulting me in the court

22
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,590
you had taken his side!

23
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,070
You were scared
at the thought of a war!

24
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,030
You, uncle,
that old geyser

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,070
and everyone present there
were left terror-stricken!

26
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,830
Calm down,
friend.

27
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,310
I am not scared,
friend

28
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,790
and neither have I forsaken you.

29
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,590
I shall die before you

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,350
and that is an oath of mine.

31
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,710
And I

32
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,550
shall indeed fulfil this oath.

33
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,150
A message has been sent.

34
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,510
We need to proceed
towards the battlefield.

35
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,630
Let’s go, friend.
Victory awaits you.

36
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,550
My darling

37
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,150
we must head westward towards Samanta Panchaka.*
A vast water reservoir in Kurukshetra (region "kshetra", now in Haryana state).

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,510
Have faith.

39
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,350
You have unparalleled might
fighting from your side.

40
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,590
Victory

41
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,590
awaits you.

42
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,350
‘I, son of Ganga’

43
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,910
‘swear on the purity
of my mother’

44
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,870
‘that I shall never become
the King of Hastinapur’

45
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,750
‘but spend the rest of my life
as its servant!’

46
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,550
‘I shall ensure that your sons
are made the Kings!’

47
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,710
‘I want you to promise me’

48
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,670
‘that under no circumstance’

49
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,790
‘will you quit being on the side
of my sons and me.’

50
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,230
‘As long as you are
the King of Hastinapur’

51
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,750
‘I shall serve you
and Hastinapur as a servant’

52
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,390
‘and deem every word
of yours an order.’

53
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,670
While fulfilling the promise
I made to my father

54
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,950
I have given rise to internal
conflicts within my family

55
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,110
Vidur.

56
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,350
In order to maintain
the sanctity of that throne

57
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,990
I have strived endlessly.

58
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,270
However, it got tainted
right before my eyes.

59
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,670
I know

60
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,870
that if this throne
did not have my protection

61
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,950
then Duryodhan would never
have dared to wage a war.

62
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,630
Uncle, you have merely
discharged your duties.

63
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,190
When a strong current

64
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,150
pushes a boat
towards the waterfall

65
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,710
the oarsman has
no fault in it, uncle.

66
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,710
You have always

67
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,110
tried to steer
the boat of Hastinapur

68
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,790
in the right direction.

69
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,350
That was not adequate,
Vidur.

70
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,190
I have seen my father

71
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,990
preside over that throne
and govern this kingdom.

72
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,510
I have seen the effects
of his righteous governance.

73
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,390
During his governance

74
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,670
his subjects were happy
and the Gods were pleased.

75
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,590
Righteousness,
knowledge

76
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,710
and justice

77
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,990
were the bases
of the Kuru kingdom.

78
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,830
And I have firm faith

79
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,990
that even Yudhishthir

80
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,630
will govern the Kuru kingdom
in a similar manner.

81
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,030
And righteousness,
justice and knowledge

82
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,150
will merge into one
on that throne.

83
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,190
However...

84
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,070
However what
saddens me is that I

85
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,190
shall not be able to witness it.

86
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,870
Today...

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,030
Today, I am standing before
this throne for the last time.

88
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,190
Uncle

89
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,310
why will you die?

90
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,550
You have been blessed with
the boon to die at will, uncle.

91
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,350
Dear Vidur

92
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,070
as long as I have
a weapon in my hands

93
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,030
the sons of Pandu
cannot win this war.

94
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,870
And I must fight in this war

95
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,150
until the reason of my death
appears before my eyes.

96
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,630
I have the boon to die at will

97
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,230
and now

98
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,310
I also wish to die.

99
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,550
I am contented,
dear Vidur

100
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,270
that the power which can end me

101
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,350
lies in the hands
of the Pandavas.

102
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,950
The army is ready
to march now, uncle.

103
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,750
We brothers and Uttar

104
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,870
are awaiting the next order
with our respective troops.

105
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,670
The General will make
the inspection soon, dear.

106
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,510
Only after that will the army
be ordered to march forth.

107
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,070
I hope you have appointed
Crown Prince Bheem

108
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,430
as the General,
Emperor.

109
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,790
No,
Your Highness

110
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,910
Grandsire Bhishma is
the General of Hastinapur.

111
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,350
Our General has to be someone

112
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,670
who can strip grandsire
of his weapons.

113
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,430
All hail Mahadev!

114
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,790
All hail Mahadev!

115
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,190
All hail Mahadev!

116
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,510
All hail Mahadev!

117
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,370
All hail Mahadev!

118
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,730
All hail Mahadev!

119
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,450
Greetings, father!

120
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,290
Give us your blessings,
father.

121
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,690
I am going to pull out

122
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,810
the thorns
from my heart forever.

123
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,730
What blessing
should I give my sons?

124
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,890
It is said that
where there is hope

125
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,090
there is no fear.

126
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,810
However,
the hope of your victory

127
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,490
and the fear of your defeat

128
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,610
have morphed into such an odd
entity in my heart today, son.

129
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,570
that I do not know myself

130
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,730
what blessing
I should give my sons.

131
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,690
In the battlefield

132
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,210
may your valour be unparalleled.

133
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,210
This is my blessing to you.

134
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,930
It will indeed be so,
father.

135
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,570
Not only will our valour
be unparalleled

136
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,890
but also our victory.

137
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,610
Give us your blessings,
mother.

138
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,770
I turned my back to light
in this life of mine.

139
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,890
I never knew the value of lamps.

140
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,210
That is why

141
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,650
I do not know any way to protect

142
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,370
the hundred lamps of mine.

143
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,610
Vindhan.

144
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,250
Vikarna.

145
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,090
Dusshasan...

146
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,570
My sons!

147
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,530
You must ensure
to protect each other!

148
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,890
Dear Duryodhan

149
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,130
please pardon me.

150
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,450
I took an oath without
thinking about the future.

151
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,650
But today,
I have known

152
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,530
that knowledge and solutions
give rise to contentment in life

153
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,850
and joy in the future.

154
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,290
Intransigence and oaths
are merely the paths to sorrow.

155
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,530
My blessing to you is

156
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,730
that may all of you be blessed!

157
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,930
Goodbye, mother.

158
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,610
Goodbye, father.

159
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,070
Greetings,
Guru Drona.

160
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,950
Greetings,
Your Excellency.

161
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,870
Greetings,
Supreme Emperor Yudhishthir.

162
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,310
I asked all of you
to gather here

163
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,590
so that everyone gets to know

164
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,950
that this place

165
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,830
is an exceedingly sacred one.

166
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,030
When Lord Parashuram had
put an end to sinners here

167
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,110
five lakes of blood were formed.

168
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,870
Hence, this place came to be
known as Samanta Panchaka.

169
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,830
To the north of this place
is the River Saraswati

170
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,510
and to its south
is the River Drishadvati.

171
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,750
The place that lies
between these two rivers

172
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,110
has been blessed by the
ancestors of Lord Parashuram.

173
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,110
This is where righteousness
shall be established.

174
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,710
Lord Indra had
blessed Emperor Kuru

175
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,830
saying that anyone who dies
in a battle in this place

176
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,190
shall get a place in heaven.

177
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,230
For your war of righteousness,
this region of righteousness

178
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,910
is most suitable.

179
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,150
Vasudev

180
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,510
Kurukshetra is a region
of righteousness.

181
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,110
Do tell us what the
appropriate day to gather here

182
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,510
with the intent
of a war will be.

183
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,110
My friend Draupadi has
already decided upon that day.

184
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,710
The day the stars
Kritika and Rohini align

185
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,030
during the ninth lunar month on
the 14th day of the waxing moon

186
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,630
is when the war will begin.

187
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,590
In other words, in three days
from now will begin

188
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,910
the Mahabharat.
