1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,580
Your majesty. Please remove
the blindfold at least for once

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,750
and look at your sons.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,650
Even my Lord hasn't seen
his sons, Sugadha.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,620
And they shall look as good in
vision as they do through touch.

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,720
Gandhari!
Gandhari! Dear sister.

6
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,580
Have all your sons taken birth?
- Yes, elder brother.

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,550
Only, my daughter is yet
to be born.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
That shall happen too.
Her birth isn't significant.

9
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,670
It is the hundred sons
that are important.

10
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,580
Brother!

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,550
I mean, she is important too...
Absolutely important.

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,680
Your daughter is significant
only to you.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,520
But for the throne of Hastinapur
and to defeat Pandu's sons

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,740
your hundred sons have
a higher significance.

15
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,610
It seems, Shakuni

16
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,580
that you have prepared
for battle already.

17
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
It's possible that...
- Indeed, your majesty.

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,710
It is possible.

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,710
'Possibility' is another name
for the cycle of creation.

20
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,570
How can I forget that?

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,520
But your majesty,
a race to the throne

22
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,450
and a race between two chariots,
are similar.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,680
In both, there is a possibility
that victory comes easy.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,540
But capability...

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,480
Competence.

26
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,420
Knowing one's capability

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,670
is always beneficial,
your majesty.

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,510
'15 years later.'

29
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,540
Come on, charioteer.
Faster!

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,420
Faster, faster...

31
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,610
What are you waiting for? The
chariot is stuck. Pull it out.

32
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,370
Be quick, charioteer.

33
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,580
Is he...
- He's my son, your majesty.

34
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,470
Karna.

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,350
How did that armour and
earrings appear on him?

36
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,420
It's God gifted, your majesty.

37
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,440
He bears them since birth.

38
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,250
Faster, faster...

39
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Who are you?

40
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,250
A 'Kshatriya' or a 'Suta'?*
Traditional Hindu varna/social rank: 1. Brahmins, 2. Kshatriyas, 3. Vaishyas, 4. Shudras.

41
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Stop!

42
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,280
My people. Today's contest
is devoid of any result.

43
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,290
None of the warriors succeeded
in toppling the flag.

44
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,110
It is a huge shame
on the entire Kuru clan.

45
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,350
The way a tree looks bare
upon all its leaves being shed

46
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,150
that is how our
empire looks today.

47
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Devoid of bravery

48
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,140
bereft of glory.

49
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,150
Today, only one youth impressed
me with his prodigal skill.

50
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,270
My charioteer
Sushen's son, Karna.

51
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,210
My boy...

52
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,140
Come here.

53
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,270
Your skill in riding a chariot

54
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,050
has truly pleased me, Karna.

55
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,270
I have immense faith

56
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,270
that you shall be a charioteer
for a prince of the Kuru clan

57
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,110
and perform a victory march
on these very grounds.

58
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,010
Chariot riding skills!

59
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,980
On behalf of the nation,
charioteer Sushen's son, Karna

60
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,020
shall be granted a reward of
a hundred gold coins

61
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,120
for displaying exceptional
skills in chariot riding.

62
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,180
Karna.

63
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,170
Collect the reward
that his majesty has granted.

64
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,010
His majesty has protected you,
charioteer.

65
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,080
Or else,
for committing the crime

66
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,040
of displaying archery skills
despite being a 'Suta'

67
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,020
you would have lost your life.

68
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,950
Do not try to rise above
your social status ever.

69
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,180
If the root which is bound to
be buried underneath the ground

70
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,210
rises above the surface,
it withers away.

71
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
Looking at your son's skills
as an archer

72
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,430
my mind is filled with
sadness and wonder, Sushen.*
*Adhiratha and Radha named Karna, Vasusena also known as Radheya (the son of Radha).

73
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,460
Forgive him, your majesty.

74
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,500
The society of Hastinapur
shall not forgive him.

75
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,490
The 'Kshatriya' soldiers and
warriors here won't forgive him.

76
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,600
If one keeps 'Ghee'* in a raw earthen pot
*A class of clarified butter.

77
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,390
the pot itself absorbs it.

78
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,590
Neither is that 'Ghee' useful,
nor is the earthen pot.

79
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,430
Skills beyond one's status
are of no use.

80
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,690
That is the fact, Sushen.

81
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,450
I have told him many a times,
your majesty

82
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,530
to give up his fondness
towards archery.

83
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,390
But...
But I...

84
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,520
I assure you, your majesty

85
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,490
that henceforth he shall
never touch a bow ever.

86
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,390
No, Sushen.

87
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,660
Archery skills are ingrained
within his soul.

88
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,490
Skills and craftsmanship
are a gift of god.

89
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,490
They cannot be repressed.

90
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,500
When a pearl attains full form,
the oyster opens itself.

91
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,350
You son's archery skills shall
surely surface as well.

92
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,620
And he is capable too.

93
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,350
But the society here won't
respect him for his skills.

94
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,360
It will punish him instead.

95
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,360
That is what I fear.

96
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,460
Here he shall have to
lay down his bow.

97
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,560
In the eastern regions,
the religion is liberal.

98
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,430
There, even other social classes
are allowed to pick up arms.

99
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,550
Tell your son that if he wishes
to learn Archery

100
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,330
he should settle down
in Magadha.

101
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,590
He must let go of his parents
and his homeland.

102
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,330
It saddens me, Sushen.

103
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,520
It is a tradition here, in the
'Kuru' and 'Panchal' regions

104
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,450
that apart from a 'Kshatriya',
no one else has the right

105
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,330
to acquire combat and weapon
skills.

106
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,550
Tradition is the religion,
Sushen.

107
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,360
And religion always asks for
sacrifice and penance.

108
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,430
Religion resides
within tradition.

109
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,490
And it is true that traditions
maintain religion.

110
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,400
But is religion solely
due to tradition?

111
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,450
Think about it.

112
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,490
The truth is that as there is
a sculpture hidden within a rock

113
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,290
there is religion within
the traditions.

114
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,290
There is a sculpture
within this stone.

115
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,330
This stone is not a sculpture
itself.

116
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,260
To bring out the sculpture,
it needs to be broken.

117
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,360
The unnecessary portions
need to be chiselled off.

118
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,330
Similarly

119
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,400
religion must be
sought within the traditions.

120
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,300
If the tradition of Indra's
veneration hadn't been broken

121
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,260
to start the tradition of
Govardhan's* veneration
*The day Krishna defeated Indra.

122
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,330
the Yadavas wouldn't have found
the way to their salvation.

123
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,450
Thus, the one who leaves
tradition unchanged

124
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,400
shall be deprived of religion.

125
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,360
And the one who blindly follows
tradition too

126
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,460
cannot acquire a religion.

127
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,420
They say that a swan has a
wisdom for distinguishing.

128
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,260
It leaves out the water
in the milk

129
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
and consumes only the milk.

130
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,360
Then, to acquire a true religion

131
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,390
is it crucial to possess wisdom
arising out of knowledge?

132
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,230
And without such a wisdom,
it is possible that one accepts

133
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,200
a religion, which is not
a true religion at all.

134
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Think about it.

135
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,290
Oh, prince!
What are you doing?

136
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,390
No! Forgive me, prince!

137
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,250
Run!

138
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,350
This is unfair.

139
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,090
No!
No, prince.

140
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,390
Please do not take away
my fish.

141
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,290
He tried to attack you with
a weapon, Dushasan.*
*Tough ruler/punisher.

142
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,230
How dare you try to attack me?
- No! No, prince!

143
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,090
Prince Dushasan,
a fisherman's boy

144
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,360
can never assault a prince.

145
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,200
He made a mistake, prince.
Forgive him.

146
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,330
I shall take his life.

147
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,160
I am the prince, Dushasan.

148
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,290
And I shall be the one
to dispense justice.

149
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,980
Step forward, lad.

150
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,260
Do you wish to say anything?

151
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,460
My prince, I was just protecting
my fish.

152
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,160
I did not lift my sickle.

153
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,360
A prince would never lie.

154
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,190
You have committed the crime of

155
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,320
raising a weapon
against a prince

156
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,390
and for that, you are
sentenced to death.

157
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,330
My prince. You may arrest him
and take him to the minister.

158
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,350
But I beg you,
not to take his life.

159
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,160
Yes, my prince.

160
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,250
After all, we fishermen are
your distant relatives.

161
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,230
The Queen mother hails
from our clan.

162
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,300
Please, don't be so harsh.
Forgive him.

163
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,200
Forgive him, prince. This boy
has no father as well.

164
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,330
Bring the boy forward.
Bring him here.

165
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,260
He must accept the punishment.

166
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,290
How dare you!

167
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,300
Break everybody's hands.

168
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,330
Prince..
- Break them!

169
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,160
Forgive us, prince.
Forgive us.

170
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,090
Break their hands!

171
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,260
Stop!

172
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,130
Duryodhan..

173
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,150
Dushasan.
- Uncle.

174
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,190
These fishermen have
insulted us.

175
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,190
They have raised their weapons
against us.

176
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,260
And I shall punish them.

177
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,260
Only the justice council
has the right to do justice.

178
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Or perhaps,
the king himself.

179
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,260
Soldiers, arrest them all.

180
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,320
Duryodhan.
Come on.

181
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,120
Uncle, you say that I must
mould myself to become the king.

182
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,100
But when I try to do justice,
you won't let me.

183
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,200
You had started a war
back there.

184
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,020
Does anyone start a war, within
a city of their own kingdom?

185
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,290
They were up in arms, uncle.

186
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,130
Do not argue.

187
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,290
A rock can break a rock.
It cannot break water.

188
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,230
Power can defeat those,
who are powerful.

189
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,220
Those who have nothing,
cannot be defeated.

190
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,030
And water drowns the rock.

191
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,000
Angry and dissatisfied subjects
can knock a king off his throne.

192
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,120
It breaks a kingdom.
Don't you understand that?

193
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,220
So do the subjects have a right
to insult a prince?

194
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,050
My dear child.

195
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,990
When will you learn to
be diplomatic?

196
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,130
You mustn't let arise
a situation

197
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,130
that would lead to your
insult in the first place.

198
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,150
Now, if that old hag
pardons these fishermen

199
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,000
then word shall spread
throughout the kingdom

200
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,000
that Duryodhan

201
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,120
has no say
within his own royal family.

202
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,030
Whom do you mean by old hag?

203
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,130
That fisherwoman.
The Queen mother of Hastinapur.

204
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,130
Now we have to get the
the fishermen punished.

205
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,060
Uncle!

206
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't let the bleeding stop.

207
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,030
This is a reward for your
foolishness.
