1
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,110
Madhav

2
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,470
Have they attacked from both the
East and the West?

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,720
This is not a mere attack, friend.

4
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,090
His Excellency has created a battle
formation in the war.

5
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,880
It is called the "Sarvodo Bhadra Vyooh".*
*Sarvatobhadra Vyuha: safe from all sides.

6
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,470
Only when the "Vajra" lies outside
this formation

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,110
can it be broken.

8
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,450
Bet our army is almost in the center,
friend.

9
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,270
His Excellency Bhishma

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,590
had been awaiting this moment.

11
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,040
He has the capability to break all
our battle formations.

12
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,290
Grandsire will annihilate our entire
army, Madhav.

13
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,670
Sons of Panchali!

14
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,810
I, Ashwatthama, the son of Guru Drona

15
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,880
am your doom!

16
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,710
Get acquainted with me!

17
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,370
Ashwatthama

18
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,440
we are the flames of a terrible fire!

19
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,910
You will not be able to extinguish
us!

20
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,440
King Virat, Dhrishtadyumna and you

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
need to go to the back of the army.

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,340
The army has no protection there!

23
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,260
Charioteer, make haste and move
forth!

24
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,990
But the sons of Panchali are present
in the East.

25
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,710
Bheem!

26
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,310
You need to go and hold off Ashwatthama! You
need to go protect the sons of Panchali!

27
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,840
Arjun, stay with brother Yudhishthir.

28
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,940
Ensure that neither grandsire nor
Duryodhan reach him!

29
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,670
No, Bheem!

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,510
Arjun must go and battle with
revered guru!

31
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,510
- But brother Yudhishthir... 
- Brother Arjun!

32
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,610
You need to go and protect the army!

33
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,740
If Guru Dronacharya is not stopped
today

34
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,740
then the war will end today itself.

35
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,720
Go on!

36
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,290
Move forth, charioteer!

37
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,610
Arjun and Bheem

38
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,610
had to leave Yudhishthir and go.

39
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,410
Now, Ashwatthama and Guru Drona

40
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,640
will not allow Arjun and Bheem

41
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,920
to return to protect Yudhishthir!

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,250
Today, for the first time in life you
have the opportunity of battling me.

43
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,810
Pick up your bow.

44
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,740
You shall strike first.

45
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,210
One more thing.

46
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,470
Ensure that your hands do not
tremble while doing so.

47
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,580
We had pardoned each other a long
time ago, friend!

48
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,070
Then why should I take to arms
against you?!

49
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,410
Help me recall an incident, friend

50
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,720
that will prevent my hands from trembling
while shooting my arrows at you!

51
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,440
"You are like my father."

52
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,190
"Why is such a thing happening with
me?"

53
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,070
I remember, friend Drona!

54
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,710
My daughter...

55
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,810
You had witnessed the daughter of
your friend being disrobed

56
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,480
in a court full of people!

57
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,110
Did the greatest warrior in the world

58
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,240
not have an iota of competence

59
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,590
to protect an aggrieved, a woman, 
a daughter?!

60
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,570
That was the gravest crime of my life,
Drupad.

61
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,270
I cannot be pardoned for that crime.

62
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,090
When the time is right I shall willingly
accept the punishment for it.

63
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,020
But by accepting the punishment

64
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,120
you gave me today

65
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,750
my head is at peace.

66
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,810
Now, my hands will not tremble

67
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,150
while discharging my duties, friend.

68
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,990
Even Nakul and Sahadev will have to
leave Yudhishthir now.

69
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,050
Release the orbs of fire!

70
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,070
Yudhishthir is by himself now.

71
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,320
It is time to attack him.

72
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,610
All the foot soldiers

73
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,250
and Atirathis*
*Rathi: a charioteer, ati: extremely skilled.

74
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,920
need to attack Yudhishthir, the son
of Pandu!

75
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,640
Ashwatthama!

76
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,870
Will you keep trying to prove yourself a
good archer by threatening young boys

77
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,790
or do you truly have the competence
to fight?!

78
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,920
Teacher!

79
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,870
Won't you allow your student an
opportunity to combat?

80
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,310
Opportunity is for exhibiting skills

81
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,350
but one's summoned for a war.

82
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,040
What do you want?

83
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,080
I neither need an opportunity or a
summon.

84
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,920
I just need your blessings.

85
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,770
Vikarna, I can't kill you

86
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,370
for Bhima has vowed

87
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,170
to kill you and your brothers.

88
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,810
But I can make you faint for sure.

89
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,870
I can surely kill you, Nakul.

90
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,410
Certainly, Vikarna.

91
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,740
If you could survive armed for a
moment or two before me.

92
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,810
I'll die of embarrassment.

93
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,380
Let the war begin!

94
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,280
Prince Duryodhan

95
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,560
it's time to attack Yudhishthir.

96
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,240
I'll take you to Yudhishthir.

97
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,750
As per the tradition

98
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,140
only a King can capture a King.

99
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,210
In this battlefield

100
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,180
you'd be representing your father.

101
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,120
Be ready to capture Yudhishthir.

102
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,720
Charioteer, move forward.

103
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,140
Hail Lord Mahadev!

104
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,570
Hail Lord Mahadev!

105
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,850
Hail Lord Mahadev!

106
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,920
The Grandsire has created a
splendid maze.

107
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,540
He has split all the Pandavas

108
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,310
and is taking me to Yudhishthir.

109
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,310
I told you, my child.

110
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,270
That's why even though he's old

111
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,150
he holds a greater significance over
others.

112
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,010
Yudhishthir will soon be captured by
us, brother.

113
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,940
The war would come to an end

114
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,770
and we'd emerge victorious.

115
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,440
Victorious!

116
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Don't hold him captive. No!

117
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,010
No matter what the Grandsire has
asked you to do.

118
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,710
As soon as you see an opportunity
you must...

119
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,660
kill Yudhishthir.

120
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,070
Prince Uttar.

121
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,840
Uncle's life is in danger.

122
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,910
Send a signal to my father.

123
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,880
Madhav, brother is battling all alone.

124
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,720
If he is captured we will lose the
war.

125
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,310
Madhav, take the chariot towards him.

126
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,260
Our face off is not yet complete,
Arjun.

127
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,520
Charioteer, let's move forward.
