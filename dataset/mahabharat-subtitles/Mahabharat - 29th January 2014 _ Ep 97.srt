1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,940
Arjun will come
to the 'swayamvar'

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,070
and get married to you.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,020
This is what King Drupad wants.

4
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,950
And what do you want, Govind?

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,910
When competence gets awarded

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,110
I derive great satisfaction
from it, beloved.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
And in the world,
does competence

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,040
solely belong to Arjun?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,910
Certainly not.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,040
How is it possible
for Mother Earth

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,920
to give birth to only one gem?

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,970
King of Anga, Karna, is also

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,810
competent.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,870
If he takes part
in the competition

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,820
then he shall certainly win it.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,850
Charvak too is a great archer

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,950
and the King of Matsya
is no less either.

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Then who am I
supposed to wait for?

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,780
Only competence?

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,850
Is competence
the sole virtue, Govind?

21
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,950
Is competence the sole joy?

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,880
Is wishing for joy in a marriage

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,940
not correct?

24
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,010
Wishing for joy in a marriage...

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,910
One who wishes for joy
does not get it, Draupadi.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,950
One who knows joy, gets it.

27
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,750
If you figure out
what joy means to you

28
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,750
then you shall indeed have joy.

29
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,770
Why do you never give
a definite answer, Govind?

30
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,920
A definite answer...

31
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,840
Because the efforts made
to have the answers

32
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,800
is called life.

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,910
Answers are another form
of salvation.

34
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,750
Nevertheless

35
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,740
as you are going
to the Shiv temple now

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,940
you should ask
Lord Shiva himself.

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
He is the Lord of Death
and Salvation.

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,740
That is why, He always
gives a definite answer.

39
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,710
If you are to get your answer

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
then you shall get it
only from Him.

41
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,910
Greetings.

42
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Greetings.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,710
Is there an inn in this city?

44
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,810
We wish to stay here
for a few days.

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
All the inns are full.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
You will not find
any place to stay here.

47
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,770
Are you travellers?
- Yes.

48
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,780
We have come from
the village of Ekachakra.

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,580
We wish to go to Naimisharanya.

50
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,770
Are you 'Brahmins?'

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,820
We have dressed up 'Brahmins.'

52
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,820
Was that half the truth?

53
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,800
Yes

54
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,750
because I never lie.

55
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,770
But there is half a lie
in half the truth.

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,580
You are correct.

57
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,650
If I utter half the truth
ever again

58
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,740
then the Almighty
will punish me.

59
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,670
But I cannot tell the truth.

60
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,520
That is why,
do not ask questions.

61
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,580
Did the lady have something?

62
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,580
Come inside.

63
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,550
I shall arrange
for you to rest and dine.

64
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,740
But you must
allow us to serve you.

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,810
It is mandatory

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,680
otherwise we shall
not accept the alms.

67
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,740
I am a potter.

68
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,580
I am old.

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,610
It is difficult
to dig up the soil.

70
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,740
You are young.
You may dig the soil up

71
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,740
and I shall offer you
a place to rest and dine.

72
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Then we shall serve you first.

73
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,550
Tell us from where
we need to dig up the soil.

74
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,580
We need to dig up the soil
to make pots

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
and not a mountain.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,510
We need to dig up
a small amount of soil.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,580
Any amount of soil you dig up
will be insufficient.

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,570
Our King is organizing
a 'swayamvar' for our Princess.

79
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,550
We have guests over
from all over the world.

80
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,650
Pots, earthen lamps and vessels
are required in great numbers.

81
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,580
The 'swayamvar'
of Princess Shikhandini? - No.

82
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,680
The deities
of the fire sacrifice

83
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
have blessed our King
with a daughter.

84
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,570
Our Princess Draupadi is divine.

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Her 'swayamvar' will begin
tomorrow at dawn.

86
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
The person who gets our Princess
will be most fortunate.

87
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,670
In order to make the pots

88
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,490
I require soil
from the river bank.

89
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,540
And in order to make the vessels

90
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,630
I require soil from behind
the Shiva temple.

91
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,530
I hope

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,540
I get a definite answer
from Mahadev.

93
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,630
Brother Bheem

94
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,470
since we are here, why do we not
pay homage to Mahadev?

95
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,400
You are correct.

96
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,300
'Brahmins,' do have
the sacrament before leaving.

97
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,570
A small banquet
has been held outside.

98
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,340
Why? - Princess Draupadi is
coming here for the veneration.

99
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,430
Brother Bheem, we should leave.

100
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,370
Let us have something first.

101
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,370
This is not alms but a banquet.

102
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,460
If Shikhandini is also here,
she will recognize us.

103
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,300
We should leave.

104
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,440
Brother Bheem, let's go!

105
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
Brother Bheem, go and dig...

106
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,200
Brother Bheem.
- W-What?

107
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,370
Go and dig up the soil.
I shall go get the cart.

108
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Go on, brother Bheem.

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,980
The aroma of food
is tempting me.

110
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,940
Prince Arjun, please let me go.

111
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,940
King Vrikodar

112
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,100
pay attention to your work.

113
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,070
Brother Bheem, in order
to make the vessels

114
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,980
we were asked to bring
soil from behind the temple.

115
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,040
Let me go get it.

116
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,140
Stop...

117
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,870
Let me go and get the soil.

118
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,040
I can do it, brother.
- No... Let me do it.

119
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Brother Bheem, I can go get it.

120
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,940
You need not worry.
I shall go get it.

121
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,000
I shall be back soon.
- But...

122
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,030
I-I will go get it.

123
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,970
It seems, King Vrikodar was
unable to suppress his appetite.

124
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,810
Govind says, you always
give a definite answer.

125
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,940
Will I get my answer, My Lord?

126
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,770
Stop, Princess.

127
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,670
Let's go, Princess.

128
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,550
Princess Shikhandini has
asked us to return soon.
