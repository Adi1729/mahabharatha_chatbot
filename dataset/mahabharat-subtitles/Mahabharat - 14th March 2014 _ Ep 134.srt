1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,180
Hastinapur can only be your
enemy henceforth, Vasudev!

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,440
Very soon, the army of
Hastinapur will attack Dwaraka!

3
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,310
We are outside the borders
of Dwaraka now, My Lord.

4
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,280
You should rest for a while

5
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,400
after which you can take
the reins of the chariot.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,170
You and your brother

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,240
can never be fully
understood by me.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,340
If your head cannot aid you
in understanding someone

9
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,170
then you should give
your heart to that person.

10
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,270
I must look for a 'Brahmin'
and get married to you soon

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,170
otherwise your brother Balaram
may come and take you away.

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,400
Marriage!
In the woods!

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,170
No, My Lord.

14
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,170
I will not get married
in the woods.

15
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,270
I wish to get married
only in a 'mandap.'

16
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,370
How can I build a 'mandap'
in these woods?

17
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,270
You need not
build one, My Lord.

18
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,210
You are still not well
acquainted with my brother.

19
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,170
When a 'mandap' was
being built in Dwaraka

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,230
brother pointed to it and said

21
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,070
'Subhadra, look.'

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,140
'You will get married
in that 'mandap.'

23
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,140
So, I will certainly
get married there.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,070
You are not well acquainted
with King Shakuni of Gandhar.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,180
Something major troubles me
at the moment.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,170
King Shakuni of Gandhar
will certainly

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,110
make Hastinapur and Dwaraka
fight each other.

28
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,070
And even Indraprastha
is not yet independent.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,140
I too shall be ordered

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,110
to fight Madhav with my Gandiva.

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,210
And not only the army of
Hastinapur, Vasudev Krishna

32
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,300
but also that of Indraprastha
shall take part in this battle!

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,210
You seem to be forgetting

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,200
that Indraprastha
is not yet independent.

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,210
The person for whom

36
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,280
you have insulted our King

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,070
that very person

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,040
will come to fight you with
his Gandiva outside Dwaraka

39
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,200
Vasudev!

40
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,010
Aunt

41
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,040
my beloved sister is your
daughter-in-law now.

42
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,270
Hastinapur and Dwaraka
may have become enemies

43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,170
but I am certain that you will
not punish my sister for it.

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,130
Even the person who chops
a tree down and burns it

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
keeps the fruits
of that tree safely.

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,100
This is tradition.

47
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,010
I cannot welcome Subhadra, dear.

48
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,140
The property
may have been divided

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,070
but not the rights.

50
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,170
The right to welcome a new
daughter-in-law lies solely

51
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,010
with the King and the Queen.

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,200
This is a major problem.

53
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,940
His Excellency

54
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,970
if Hastinapur does not
welcome Arjun's wife

55
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,910
then it would mean

56
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,010
that Hastinapur has
accepted Indraprastha

57
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,010
as an independent state.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,170
King Dhritarashtra

59
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,000
you must welcome Arjun's wife

60
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,910
and deem Dwaraka
a part of family

61
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,170
otherwise

62
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,030
you must declare the sons
of Pandu independent.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,870
What do you suggest

64
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,010
His Excellency Bhishma?

65
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,840
Dear Dhritarashtra

66
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,030
you must welcome Arjun.

67
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,800
My darling

68
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,810
Vasudev is no longer your enemy.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,940
He is my enemy now.

70
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,830
I will crush the Yadavas

71
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,840
even if the entire Aryan region

72
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,000
is set ablaze with
the fire of a war.

73
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,930
Greetings, mother!

74
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,000
Arjun!

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,940
Son

76
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,780
heat of a fire turns
gold ores into pure gold.

77
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,840
Similarly

78
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,770
after every struggle

79
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
my sons become more glorious.

80
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,770
I am very proud of you, son.

81
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,870
When a mother has the capability
of challenging her own self

82
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,730
her sons are bound to be
powerful, mother.

83
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,900
While deciding not to
come to Indraprastha

84
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,740
your heart must have broken
into a thousand pieces.

85
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,680
I can only imagine what you
must have gone through.

86
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,910
I can only imagine it.

87
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,800
Do not worry for me, son.

88
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,680
In order to find a pearl

89
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,900
its shell is bound to be broken.

90
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
No, mother.

91
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,940
We will not let that happen.

92
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,700
We will not.

93
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,870
As you had instructed

94
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,780
we will become independent

95
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,900
and Indraprastha

96
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,710
shall be sanctified
by your presence.

97
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,800
Let's go, son.

98
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,830
Krishna has said that your
penance is now over.

99
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,730
You must now get married

100
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,640
return to Indraprastha soon

101
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
and perform the Rajsuya 'Yajna.'

102
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Indraprastha awaits you, son.

103
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,830
Her Highness

104
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,800
Prince Bheem has
sent this 'laddoo.'

105
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
My Lord Bheem knows

106
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,830
that My Lord Arjun has
the right to me this year.

107
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,640
So, I too shall spend this year
engrossed in a penance.

108
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,670
I consume only two
food items every day.

109
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,770
He knows this quite well
and hence, has sent

110
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,640
only one 'laddoo'
for you to taste.

111
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,610
He has made this himself.

112
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
He has said that if black gram

113
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,680
is soaked overnight...
- That is enough.

114
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,710
I will not be able to understand
his culinary skills.

115
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,540
Place the 'laddoo'
on the plantain leaf

116
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,730
and take away
this bowl of 'kheer.'

117
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,760
Will you

118
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,580
eat just this much,
Her Highness?

119
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,710
Yes.

120
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,700
This is a penance.

121
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,610
My Lord Arjun

122
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,700
must also have been
doing the same for years.

123
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,700
'Panchali, as ordered by
righteousness and tradition'

124
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,570
'I am going to marry again.'

125
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,700
'With this marriage,
my dedication to you'

126
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,530
'will indeed magnify.'

127
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,640
'I promise you this.'

128
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,600
'I hope I have
your permission for this.'

129
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,530
'May this wife of mine'

130
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,670
'have your love and protection.'

131
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,420
Give us your blessings, uncle.

132
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,520
Bless you.

133
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,350
Dear Subhadra

134
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,550
welcome to the Kuru dynasty.

135
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,350
Now, you and Arjun need not

136
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,520
come to Hastinapur
to seek our blessings.

137
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,550
You may go to Indraprastha.

138
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,260
On behalf of the
Kuru dynasty, the present

139
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,480
will be sent over to you
in Indraprastha.

140
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,410
Let's go, Gandhari

141
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,460
Vikarna.

142
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,290
Queen Mother

143
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,290
your daughter-in-law
seeks your blessings.

144
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,250
May you be blessed with a son.

145
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Bless you.

146
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Greetings, grandsire.

147
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,290
Stop, dear.

148
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,220
Do not touch my feet.

149
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,150
I will not be able to
give you my blessings.

150
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,130
A blessing is an expression
of one's emotions.

151
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,350
The one who dips
his hand in a reservoir

152
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,330
is bound to get water.

153
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,320
The reservoir has
no say in this.

154
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,090
Similarly

155
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,380
people who seek the
blessings of their elders

156
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,190
are bound to receive it.

157
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,260
A reservoir that has dried up

158
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,130
no longer yields
any water, Vasudev.

159
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,120
Upon seeing this
unrighteous deed

160
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,290
my heart too has dried up.

161
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,250
Which unrighteous deed,
Your Excellency?

162
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,290
The Kuru dynasty has been
insulted in this 'mandap' today!

163
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,490
A maiden meant to marry someone

164
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,620
cannot be married to
someone else, Vasudev.

165
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,720
So, do the feelings
of the maiden

166
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,680
have no importance?

167
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,500
If you had given your word
after asking the maiden

168
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,560
then it would have been correct.

169
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,530
But disregarding tradition
in this manner is incorrect.

170
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,390
A human being can trust another

171
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,520
only when traditions
are adhered to.

172
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,420
Traditions...

173
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,520
Traditions

174
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,550
are like mangoes.

175
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,550
When they are born,
they taste bitter.

176
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,390
After a while,
they taste sour.

177
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,460
Only the ones
who like the sour taste

178
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,660
accept them readily.

179
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,660
And after some more time

180
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,460
they taste sweet.

181
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,600
They become
everyone's favourite.

182
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,590
But after a point of time

183
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,460
they turn to mush.

184
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,390
They begin to reek,
Your Excellency.

185
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
The person who
consumes them falls ill.

186
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,520
And in the end, all that
is left are the dried up pits

187
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,490
which are of no use to anyone.

188
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,390
I have nothing against
traditions, Your Excellency

189
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,520
but when they become
a tool of exploitation

190
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,400
and begin to give
sorrow instead of joy

191
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,490
they should be
buried in the earth

192
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,360
in order to give rise
to newer ones.

193
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,400
Who gets to decide

194
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,520
which tradition is decaying?

195
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,420
You, Vasudev?

196
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,490
No

197
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,450
time will decide that

198
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,360
and everyone must obey the
rules of time, Your Excellency.

199
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,330
For the entire Aryan region

200
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,420
this is the time of 'sankranti.'*
*Transmigration of the Sun from one zodiac to the next.

201
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,550
The way Surya Dev changes
his course in a 'sankranti'

202
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
similarly

203
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,460
the entire Aryan region
is about to change its course.

204
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,290
Old traditions will break

205
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,490
old empires will crumble to dust

206
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,560
new definitions of righteousness
will be written

207
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,530
and a new era will be ushered,
Maharathi Bhishma!

208
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,520
And in this cycle of time,
you must decide

209
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,530
on which side you wish to be

210
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,430
because everyone will be caught
in this vortex of time.

211
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,430
People who have chosen
the path of unrighteousness

212
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,430
will usher this change

213
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,290
and the ones who have
chosen that of righteousness

214
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,200
will establish the new era.

215
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,280
This is pre-decided.
