1
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,330
Yudhishthir, you truly
are very powerful.

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,370
The blood of which dynasty
runs through your veins?

3
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,370
From whom did your characterless
mother conceive you?

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,330
Pray tell me.

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,400
I cannot fight you
any longer, Duryodhan.

6
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,530
This is a friendly competition.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,300
And there can be no place
for anger in it.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,270
However, you had angered me
for a moment back then.

9
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,290
If I raise my weapon
against you now

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,490
it will be unrighteous.

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,530
But it is not
unrighteous for me.

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,270
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,500
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

14
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,460
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

15
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,500
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

16
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,240
Your Majesty,
Prince Duryodhan is victorious.

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,430
This ovation is the evidence

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,490
that my Duryodhan

19
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,330
has returned
as a unique warrior.

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,270
Was Duryodhan victorious again?

21
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,290
No.

22
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,240
This time,
only Yudhishthir was defeated.

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Had you waited
a few more moments there

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,430
you could have defeated him
quite easily. - No.

25
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,200
Had I waited there, I would have
defeated myself quite easily.

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,230
You can call Arjun now, son.

27
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,400
What if Bheem defeats Duryodhan?

28
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,260
And the subjects get robbed
of the opportunity to see Arjun.

29
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,340
Bheem will not win, father.

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
And Arjun?

31
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,240
He will not even reach here.

32
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
'Bheem.'

33
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,260
Duryodhan.

34
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,290
While fighting Bheem...
- I need no suggestion

35
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,190
or advice.

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,400
The day I get defeated by him

37
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,360
it will be

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,360
the last day of my life.

39
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,360
Go on, my dear.
Go on.

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,100
Mother, I knew it all along.

41
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,230
Only brother Bheem can compete
against brother Duryodhan.

42
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,300
Now, let's see how brother Bheem

43
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,270
crushes brother Duryodhan's
vanity.

44
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,290
Kunti.

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,140
Why is the earth trembling?

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,340
Bheem has entered
the arena, sister-in-law.

47
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,260
All hail Prince Bheem!

48
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,200
All hail Prince Bheem!

49
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,100
All hail Prince Bheem!

50
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,100
All hail Prince Bheem!

51
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,260
All hail Prince Bheem!

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,300
All hail Prince Bheem!

53
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,230
All hail Prince Bheem!

54
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,200
All hail Prince Bheem!

55
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,140
All hail Prince Bheem!

56
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,140
All hail Prince Bheem!

57
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,240
All hail Prince Bheem!

58
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Your Majesty, among Prince Bheem
and Prince Duryodhan

59
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,970
the former seems more
proficient. - Be quiet, Sanjay!

60
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,000
All hail Prince Bheem!

61
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,190
All hail Prince Bheem!

62
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,130
All hail Prince Bheem!

63
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,930
All hail Prince Bheem!

64
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Your majesty!

65
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,960
This competition will make
a mockery out of us before all.

66
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,840
The fear evident in the princes
is scaring the subjects.

67
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,930
Order this to end right now.

68
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,000
In other words, you mean to say

69
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
that without even giving
others the opportunity

70
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,030
Should I declare
Duryodhan the winner?

71
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,900
No, grandsire.
That would be unrighteous.

72
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,970
It is important to give
one chance to all the princes.

73
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,060
The winner will be declared
only at sunset, grandsire.

74
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,590
Your Majesty, Prince Duryodhan's
forehead is bleeding.

75
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,590
Prince Bheem has broken
a rule of the competition

76
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,590
your Majesty.
- Splendid.

77
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,360
Now, it will not be unrighteous
to declare Duryodhan the winner.

78
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,550
Sound the conch shells.

79
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,560
Stop!

80
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,420
Bheem, stop!

81
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,560
Bheem...
Bheem!

82
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Bheem!

83
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,400
You have violated the rules
of the competition.

84
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,430
Who said I was competing,
teacher?

85
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
I have been blessed
by the great Vasuki

86
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,360
and I was just giving him
a taste of that boon.

87
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,560
And of the things that will
happen to him in the future

88
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,460
this was just a slice.

89
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,230
The glory of winning
the competition

90
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,470
can be garnered only by Arjun.

91
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,270
The winner of this competition

92
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,420
is Prince Duryodhan!

93
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,520
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

94
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,390
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

95
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,370
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

96
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,260
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

97
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,230
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

98
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,420
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

99
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,290
Do not be sad, Bheem.

100
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,420
Someone is bound to lose
in a competition.

101
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,230
I am sad, brother Yudhishthir.

102
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,260
Upon reaching here,
I had the thought

103
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,400
that if I ripped
Duryodhan's head from his neck

104
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,190
then what would have happened.

105
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,420
I'd have been just disqualified
from the competition.

106
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,470
But you are not more intelligent
than me, brother.

107
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,220
Brother, I was just...

108
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
'Arjun.'

109
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,270
Premonition.
Did I not tell you, Nakul?

110
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,260
The premonition of victory.

111
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,350
That time has come.

112
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,330
Brother Arjun is on his way.

113
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,260
Now, the next to enter the arena

114
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,390
is Prince Arjun of the Pandavas!

115
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,200
All hail Prince Arjun!

116
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,130
Even a 'gadaa'* is useless before Arjun's arrows.
*Bludgeon.

117
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,220
He is neither hot-headed
like Bheem

118
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,320
nor is he a saint
like Yudhishthir.

119
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,230
The one who scared me
since the beginning

120
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,160
was no one but Arjun.

121
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,270
My dear, that problem
has been taken care of.

122
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,100
'The doorway to the arena
that you shall construct'

123
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,290
'should collapse
at the correct time'

124
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,200
'with just one arrow.'

125
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,170
You wish to drop that structure
of the doorway, do you not, son?

126
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,100
So that the doorway

127
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,220
collapses on Arjun?

128
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,260
Give me that.
Let me do it for you.

129
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,100
My disciple is on his way.

130
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,160
Arjun.

131
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,620
Arjun!

132
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
All hail Prince Arjun!

133
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,360
All hail Prince Arjun!

134
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,360
All hail Prince Arjun!

135
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,360
All hail Prince Arjun!

136
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,510
All hail Prince Arjun!

137
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,520
All hail Prince Arjun!
- My son.

138
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,550
Arjun.
- All hail Prince Arjun!

139
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,320
All hail Prince Arjun!

140
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
All hail Prince Arjun!

141
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,560
All hail Prince Arjun!

142
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,550
All hail Prince Arjun!

143
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,350
Brother Arjun is victorious even
before engaging in the fight.

144
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,490
You must be wondering, son

145
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,450
how he did not get
crushed under the debris.

146
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,520
He created a canopy
of arrows over his head.

147
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,480
He is Arjun.

148
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,310
All hail Prince Arjun!

149
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,520
All hail Prince Arjun!

150
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,360
All hail Prince Arjun!

151
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,520
All hail Prince Arjun!

152
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,380
All hail Prince Arjun!

153
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,460
All hail Prince Arjun!

154
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,460
All hail Prince Arjun!

155
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,290
All hail Prince Arjun!

156
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,520
All hail Prince Arjun!

157
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,520
All hail Prince Arjun!

158
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,350
All hail Prince Arjun!

159
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,290
We must now resort
to deception, uncle.

160
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,280
When it comes to deception,
it is

161
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,290
successful only when one has
personal limitations, my dear.

162
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,450
But I do not see
his limitations.

163
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
Then what do we do now?

164
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,260
If you do not have
the means to win

165
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,320
then it is wise to accept
defeat, my dear.
