1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,280
As long as you are
the King of Hastinapur

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,350
I shall serve you and
Hastinapur as a servant

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,120
and deem every word
of yours an order.

4
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,380
Every living moment of my life

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,360
will be spent in protecting you.

6
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,180
But today...

7
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,080
Today, you must
divide this kingdom.

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,350
And declare Yudhishthir King.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,050
Give the sons of Pandu

10
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,210
just one opportunity
to lead a happy life, dear.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,190
Just one opportunity...

12
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,280
As you say,
uncle.

13
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,190
Be seated on your throne.

14
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,090
Division of the Kuru kingdom!
How is that possible?

15
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,990
Maybe it is their way of ousting
the son of Pandu, Yudhishthir

16
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,950
and keeping him from becoming
the King of Hastinapur.

17
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,220
That is why, by giving
him another kingdom

18
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,010
they are driving him
away from the state.

19
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,090
In other words,
Hastinapur will now be ruled

20
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,990
by the sons of Dhritarashtra!

21
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,020
I will leave Hastinapur
and reside in the new city.

22
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,990
But how can we leave?
Our entire world belongs here.

23
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,990
The ones who can leave with
the sons of Pandu are fortunate.

24
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,220
We would truly be fortunate

25
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,960
when we get to see Crown Prince
Yudhishthir become the King.

26
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,990
Hear all!
Hear all!

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,020
The son of Pandu and the
Kuru dynasty's daughter-in-law

28
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,110
the daughter of Drupad,
Panchali

29
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,210
are making their entrance!

30
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
My dear

31
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,050
I do not see joy on your face.

32
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,120
What should I
rejoice for, uncle?

33
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,120
That old geyser made
Yudhishthir King

34
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,910
and crushed my dreams
of becoming one forever.

35
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,080
When did I ask you
to experience joy?

36
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,010
But you must pretend,
my dear.

37
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,890
If you pretend to be happy

38
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,920
then you will also find

39
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,920
the reason to rejoice.

40
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,820
Greetings,
His Highness!

41
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,820
Son of Pandu,
Yudhishthir

42
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,980
you may present your proposal
to His Highness now.

43
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
If those people are given

44
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,950
the fertile region near
the bank of the Ganges, uncle

45
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,890
then I will break
the peace treaty

46
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,790
and attack that region
tomorrow itself.

47
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,790
Calm down, my dear.
Calm down.

48
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,820
I keep telling you...

49
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,010
The ones who walk on
the path of righteousness

50
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,020
are the most susceptible
to unrighteous ploys.

51
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,850
Just wait and watch.

52
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
May the Kuru King
be victorious!

53
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,790
Your Highness, I,
the son of Pandu, Yudhishthir

54
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,860
by respecting your wishes

55
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:38,980
accept a portion
of the Kuru kingdom

56
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,810
as a part of the treaty.

57
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,790
Allow me to be crowned
the King, Your Highness.

58
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,010
You have my permission,
Yudhishthir.

59
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,990
But

60
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,720
before you are crowned the King,
you must tell me

61
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,980
which region of the Kuru kingdom
you wish to have.

62
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,980
Excluding the city of Hastinapur

63
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,990
you may ask for any other region
of the Kuru kingdom

64
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,980
but its expanse...

65
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,980
Its expanse

66
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,720
should not be more than
half of the Kuru kingdom.

67
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,950
Go ahead and ask,
Yudhishthir.

68
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,790
What do you want?

69
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,750
Your Highness

70
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,790
numerous regions

71
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,780
were made prosperous
with your labour

72
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,750
and if I am made the King
of any of those regions

73
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,650
then it would not
denote my valour.

74
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,920
While transferring
his property to his son

75
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,720
a father feels overjoyed

76
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,690
but when a son
earns his property

77
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,750
through hard work and labour

78
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,880
his father is left ecstatic.

79
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
You are like my father,
Your Highness.

80
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,950
I wish to inherit your
strength and competence

81
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,810
and not property.

82
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,780
That is why,
Your Highness

83
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,790
we brothers have decided

84
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,790
that with your permission

85
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,860
we would like to go
to Khandavprastha

86
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,760
and build a new city there.

87
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
My dear

88
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,880
did you find the reason
to rejoice now?

89
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Dear Yudhishthir

90
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,690
you do not know about
Khandavprastha.

91
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,780
I know,
grandsire.

92
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,750
The Yaduvanshi King

93
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,650
Sudarshan, had his kingdom
there many years ago.

94
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,810
Lord Indra once
cursed that kingdom

95
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,690
which made all the water
there to dry up.

96
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,850
It was even robbed of the rains.
The buildings of that city

97
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,690
were destroyed by the King of
Kashi with Lord Indra's help.

98
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
And the region
was left desolate.

99
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,820
We have taken
an oath, grandsire

100
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,720
that we will
salvage that region.

101
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,560
And try our best to augment the
prestige of the Kuru kingdom.

102
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,620
You will not be able to,
Yudhishthir.

103
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,620
The woods near that region

104
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,610
are home to a small clan
of serpent worshippers.

105
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,780
But they are venomous beings.

106
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,810
The beings there
are against humans.

107
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,590
Their leader is an illusory
serpent called Dakshak

108
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,820
and any human who
goes to Khandavprastha

109
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,750
gets killed by him for he
has taken such an oath.

110
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,660
No human will go with you
to reside over there.

111
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,680
You cannot succeed
in this endeavour.

112
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,550
The basis of success

113
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,780
is the blessing of
one's father, grandsire.

114
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
If we have
your blessings with us

115
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,620
then we shall certainly
be successful.

116
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,710
That is a foolish decision,
Yudhishthir!

117
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:36,820
Your Highness

118
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,610
I have selected a few regions

119
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,560
which comprise half
the Kuru kingdom.

120
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,720
Giving the sons of Pandu
those regions would be correct

121
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,750
and just as well.

122
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,520
Impossible,
His Excellency!

123
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,750
Yudhishthir must have thought
about it before making the plea.

124
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,520
And fulfilling his plea
is my duty, Your Excellency.

125
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Dear Yudhishthir

126
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,710
I give you one lakh* gold coins
*100.000.

127
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,680
and one lakh cows
for establishing your city.

128
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,420
In the Kuru kingdom,
whichever subject

129
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,690
is ready to leave with you
out of his own free will

130
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,520
has my permission to do so.

131
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,490
What kind of a decision is that?

132
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Yudhishthir

133
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,560
I declare you the independent
King of Khandavprastha!

134
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,510
I declare you the independent
King of Khandavprastha!

135
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,280
But do remember, dear.

136
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,510
There is a tradition
of the Aryan region...

137
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,380
Until more than 100 Kings

138
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,310
accept you as a stronger
ruler than themselves

139
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,350
you will not be deemed
an independent King.

140
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,340
You will be an independent King
only for the sake of it.

141
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,510
Your kingdom will have
no flag of its own.

142
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,470
Any oath of office
in your kingdom

143
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,340
will be taken only in the name
of the throne of Hastinapur.

144
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,440
And all the official documents

145
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,450
will be in the name
of Hastinapur as well.

146
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Revered Kripacharya

147
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,480
do begin the crowning
ceremony of Yudhishthir.

148
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,270
As you say,
Your Highness.

149
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,210
May this gold crown represent

150
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,170
your fame,
Prestige

151
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,270
prosperity,
competence

152
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,110
valour and all your rights.

153
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,340
May it adorn the head of
the King of Khandavprastha

154
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,240
the son of Pandu,
Yudhishthir for ages to come!

155
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,010
All hail King Yudhishthir!

156
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,020
All hail King Yudhishthir!

157
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,070
All hail King Yudhishthir!

158
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,170
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!

159
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,210
All hail King Yudhishthir!
All hail King Yudhishthir!

160
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,080
All hail King Yudhishthir!
- My darling

161
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,050
just wait and watch

162
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,140
the splendid plan

163
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,140
I came up with
to ensure your safety.

164
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Dear Yudhishthir

165
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,890
your kingdom is now
independent of Hastinapur.

166
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,870
And I have firm faith

167
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,100
that no region of Hastinapur
will be eyed by you any longer.

168
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,900
In order to augment
the boundaries of your kingdom

169
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,800
you will never attack
Hastinapur, dear.

170
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,100
In order to multiply the
property of your kingdom

171
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,960
the property of Hastinapur

172
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,860
will never be snatched by you.

173
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,990
I promise you,
uncle

174
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,900
that I shall always remember

175
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,990
that my uncle Dhritarashtra

176
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,920
aunt Gandhari

177
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,820
uncle Vidur

178
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,860
and beloved Duryodhan
reside in this kingdom.

179
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,960
This is also the residence
of your mother Kunti, dear.

180
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,930
Do not forget that.

181
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,730
What do you mean?

182
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,830
Kunti is the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru dynasty.

183
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,960
After the demise of my
beloved younger brother Pandu

184
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,800
it is my duty
to keep her safe, dear.

185
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,960
Kunti will stay here.

186
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,960
With Gandhari
and in her security.

187
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,670
And this is not an order
of a cruel King

188
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,770
Kunti!

189
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,770
Your brother-in-law
and sister-in-law

190
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,660
are merely making
a humble request.
