1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,570
May God bless you.

2
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,310
Greetings, sister.

3
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,400
Greetings, Dhrishtadyumna.

4
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,530
Vasudeva

5
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,410
this Brahman

6
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,410
who has sworn never
to ride a chariot

7
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,340
are you sure

8
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,280
that he will one day
sit on the throne?

9
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,480
Your daughter will definitely
sit on a throne, Your Highness.

10
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,280
You're

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,310
worried about
your daughter's future.

12
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,500
But every day

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,310
and every moment
of the future

14
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,340
has been decided.

15
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,510
Your Highness, future
is nothing but

16
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,370
the result of our present
decisions and deeds.

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,240
If you're happy with the
decisions you took today

18
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,300
then have faith

19
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,270
you will definitely be blessed
with a happy future.

20
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,180
A difficult competition
of archery

21
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,470
was won by a Brahman, Vidur.

22
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,330
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,440
Even the message
of our spy reads the same.

24
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,330
That when no prince
could triumph

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,240
the princess was married
to a young Brahman.

26
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,400
Then, Vidur

27
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,400
you will have to leave
for Kampilya, immediately

28
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,340
in order to get
that young Brahman

29
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,240
his four brothers

30
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,280
and mother

31
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,400
to Hastinapur.

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,150
But no one should learn that
the five Pandavas are alive.

33
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,270
Before Shakuni formulates
another conspiracy

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,370
get all the five Pandavas
and their mother to Hastinapur.

35
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,300
Definitely, grandsire.

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,210
Brahman Batukeshwar

37
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,270
isn't it necessary during
a marriage to know the names

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,350
of the bride and the groom?

39
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,180
Uh!

40
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,110
I didn't ask this young Brahman
his name.

41
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,280
What's your name?

42
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
V-Vateshwar.

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,300
Vateshwar!
And what's your lineage?

44
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,270
Lineage?

45
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,370
Why do you want to know
about my lineage?

46
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,180
I should know your lineage in
order to get you two married.

47
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
Hey!

48
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,240
Hey!
Someshwar...

49
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,240
Someshwar!

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,180
Someshwar.
Som...

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,270
Someshwar!

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,070
Your elder brother acted smart.

53
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,270
Your

54
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,180
secret was not revealed.

55
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,270
Secret...
What secret?

56
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,070
How am I to know that?

57
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,110
But there's

58
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,040
definitely some secret.

59
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,040
You don't reveal
your lineage.

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
You can't remember your name.

61
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,270
You are the world's best archer

62
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,210
yet, you don't wield a bow!

63
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,200
I have learnt archery

64
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
that's why I'm good.

65
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,240
I don't aim
to be the best.

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,080
I'm a Brahman.
Hence I don't wield a bow.

67
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
What is the secrecy in it?

68
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,200
Brother Someshwar!

69
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,180
Why did you halt?

70
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,110
He says that the princess
is not married.

71
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,140
Hence she cannot be left
alone with you.

72
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,110
Hey...

73
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,200
Someshwar, I want to see
Vateshwar's face.

74
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,000
Show me his face.

75
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,970
Come on, quick!

76
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,070
Tell me your lineage.
You are to be married.

77
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,240
Brahman Batukeshwar

78
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,980
will you get us married
on the way?

79
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,980
The marriage will take place
in the society

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
in everyone's presence.

81
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,170
I'm just recollecting
the marital chants.

82
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,170
But

83
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,200
are these the marital chants?

84
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,140
Being a Brahman,
don't you know

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,980
what the marital chants are?
- Brother Someshwar

86
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,170
the marital chants at your
wedding were different.

87
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,910
Yes.
Those chants were...

88
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,040
What is he reciting?

89
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,010
Are you married to a demoness?

90
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,070
You made a very big mistake,
Brahman Batukeshwar.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, brother Someshwar is angry.

92
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,050
You call my wife a demoness!

93
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,040
No one has the courage
to marry a demoness.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,140
Princess.

95
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,140
Princess, protect me.

96
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,980
You're right, sir.

97
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,980
But if you kill the demoness'
brother, Hidimb

98
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,110
then you have to marry Hidimba.

99
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,980
How do you know this, princess?

100
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,070
The king's spies give him
all the information.

101
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,070
But, sir

102
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,850
only demons can win
against the demons, right?

103
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,850
Other than Lord Parashuram
and Guru Dronacharya

104
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,970
no ordinary Brahman
can defeat them.

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,980
This means

106
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,810
a...

107
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,010
A demon has won me?

108
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,900
I definitely have
been won by a demon.

109
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,780
Do I look as terrifying
as a demon to you?

110
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,000
What?
Are demons terrifying?

111
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,970
No, brother.

112
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,010
That's not what I meant.

113
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,870
I was just saying that

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,910
I am in a Brahman's attire.

115
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,910
You...

116
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,810
You please stop crying.

117
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,950
Brother Someshwar, would
sister-in-law too cry like this?

118
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes, sometimes.

119
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,840
Now go and persuade
the princess.

120
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,910
How, brother?
- Apologise!

121
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,940
Apologise for what?

122
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,880
If you want to have
a peaceful married life

123
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,930
then keep apologising.

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
I am saying this
out of experience. Go.

125
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,810
Go.

126
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,810
Princess, stop crying.

127
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,970
Forgive me.

128
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,810
I lied to you.

129
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,930
I am not a Brahman.

130
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I am a Kshatriya.

131
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,970
My name is Arjun.

132
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,930
And he is brother Bheem.

133
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,870
We have given up
our kingdom.

134
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,880
Hence we are disguised
as Brahmans.

135
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,830
I knew that.

136
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,750
I just wanted to
hear it from you.

137
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,830
Let's go.

138
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,730
You're not a Brahman!

139
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,870
You're a Kshatriya!

140
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,780
I had never imagined
that someone would

141
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,800
deceive me like this!
Leave, all of you.

142
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,670
Wait, sir.

143
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,910
At least accept the offering.

144
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,640
If he has renounced
all ornaments

145
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,740
then how can I wear them?

146
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,740
Give them.

147
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,710
It will benefit
the Brahman.

148
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,870
Other than those that are
the symbol of auspiciousness

149
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,710
give me all your ornaments.

150
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,680
Why did you make
me a part of this

151
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,840
I couldn't understand.

152
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,520
Brother

153
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,550
the minute we entered
into the 'Swayamvar'

154
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,550
I knew

155
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,550
that brother Arjun
will be victorious.

156
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,550
Your intuition is always
true, Sahadev.

157
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,450
But, why aren't they

158
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,570
here yet?

159
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,470
Brother

160
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,520
here they are.

161
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,570
Greetings, brother.

162
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,520
Bheem

163
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,490
what happened?
What took you so long?

164
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,640
I could see
a brilliant opportunity

165
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,650
hence I was waiting for it.

166
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,390
But I couldn't get
that opportunity, brother.

167
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,470
What do you mean?

168
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,480
It was His Highness, Shakuni

169
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,620
who provoked all the kings
for a battle.

170
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,640
I thought Duryodhan
will step forward

171
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,570
and I'll kill him.

172
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,510
But they left without fighting.

173
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,620
Maybe they were scared.

174
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,610
Don't be unjust to Karna,
brother Bheem.

175
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,420
He doesn't possess
the trait of fear.

176
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,580
Brother Sumangal

177
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,540
why are you referring
to brother Someshwar

178
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,610
as Bheem?

179
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,550
But why are you
referring to Vateshwar

180
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,350
as Sumangal?

181
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,380
Isn't that the name you told me?

182
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,540
I am sure Arjun has told
Princess Draupadi

183
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,350
who we really are.

184
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,380
What you did was right, Arjun.

185
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,350
The one who is capable
of being a life partner

186
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,320
nothing should be
hidden from her.

187
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,580
Brother, hadn't I told you
that I had an intuition?

188
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,280
Welcome, princess Draupadi.

189
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,480
Hold on, princess.

190
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,320
You're not married yet.

191
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,540
You're the princess of Panchal.

192
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,320
You touching anyone's feet

193
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,450
is not apt.

194
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,320
But I have vowed to
complete this journey

195
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,350
with your brother.

196
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,320
Yet, princess

197
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,380
you should first seek
mother's blessings.

198
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,310
Parents have the right to bestow
an identity upon any relation.

199
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,220
Arjun

200
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,250
let's go.

201
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,250
Take princess Draupadi
and go ahead.

202
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,410
Mother must be waiting.
- As you say.

203
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,420
Mother was about
to perform some ritual.

204
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,220
She must be done by now.

205
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,250
You're welcome, Princess.

206
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,330
Brother Arjun!

207
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,230
Mother

208
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,150
look what I got as alms.

209
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,230
Look, mother

210
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,190
how lucky brother Arjun has
become with just the alm.

211
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,960
You shouldn't say that, son.

212
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,040
Since childhood
I have taught you

213
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,100
be it alms or punishment

214
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,190
all five brothers will always
have equal rights on it

215
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,150
and not just one brother.

216
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,130
Mother...
- It's my order, Yudhishthira

217
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,960
that whatever Arjun
has received

218
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,920
should be shared among
all you brothers.
