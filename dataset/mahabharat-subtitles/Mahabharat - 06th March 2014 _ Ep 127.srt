1
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,560
Grandsire.

2
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,480
What's the penalty for going
against a king's order?

3
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,650
Who has committed the of fence

4
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,360
is also significant
to be considered.

5
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,430
What's the significance
in that, grandsire?

6
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,590
It's enough to know
that the of fence

7
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,420
has been committed!

8
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,480
Tell me!
What's the punishment

9
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,650
for opposing a king's order?

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,430
Sometimes,
to save a person's life

11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,620
the physician amputates
that person's limb.

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,550
But that doesn't make him
an enemy.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,490
He is not punished.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,550
Instead, he is rewarded.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,390
What Kunti did
at the entrance

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,520
was correct.

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,490
She stopped the rise
of a protest in the kingdom.

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,460
I've heard the discussions
amongst the subjects

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,550
in the kingdom,
grandsire!

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,580
Everyone was saying,
if the king's command

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,590
was very difficult to follow

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,360
then seek refuge
with the mother queen.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,450
Father, now
no one's afraid of the king.

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,580
So, what's inefficient
about it, son?

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,480
The king's duty is not to spread
fear among his subjects.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,450
His duty is to protect
his subjects

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,510
from all their fear in life.

28
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,550
Then, why is father
crowned the king, mother?

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,420
Let Lady Kunti sit
on the throne.

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,560
Lady Kunti will rule the kingdom
taking advice from her sons.

31
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,460
This means, even Hastinapur
will now be ruled

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,320
as per
brother Yudishthir's wish.

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,550
Then how does division
of kingdoms hold good?

34
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,390
What do you wish, dear?

35
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,520
I want Lady Kunti
to be rightly punished.

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,480
That would be sheer foolishness,
son.

37
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,260
The Pandavas will avenge
their mother's insult.

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,520
Do you wish to see a war?

39
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,430
They can never
fight a battle, mother.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,480
They don't have the liberty
to fight a battle.

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,350
Their flag isn't going to be
hoisted in that kingdom, mother.

42
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,480
Only Hastinapur's flag
will fly high.

43
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,490
How will they fight a battle?

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,430
Grandsire,
please take the decision.

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
I...

46
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,320
I serve this kingdom.

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,260
The king will take
the decision, Your Ladyship.

48
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,250
I have only one boon

49
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,230
that my father had given me.

50
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,420
The boon to decide
the time of my death.

51
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,320
I don't have any other boon,
Your Ladyship.

52
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,190
Grandsire.

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Grandsire, please don't
speak sorrowfully.

54
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,320
I accept your advice.

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,350
Kunti won't be punished, son.

56
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,190
But, Gandhari,
it's also necessary

57
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,160
to stop the subjects
of Hastinapur

58
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
from setting
towards Indraprastha.

59
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,190
Hence, I've decided
that not just the subjects

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,380
but even the royal family
shall not take part

61
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,280
in the inaugural ceremony
of the kingdom.

62
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,280
Inform Kunti
regarding the same.

63
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,290
Dear!

64
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,150
Dear

65
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,390
you cannot be unjust.

66
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,160
A mother lives with only
one hope in life.

67
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,350
To see her sons
obtain happiness and success.

68
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,120
Today when Kunti's sons
are going to achieve

69
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,320
such a huge success

70
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,320
how can we snatch away

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
this opportunity to witness
this success from Kunti?

72
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,280
I know that, Gandhari.

73
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,060
I'm extremely contrite
about it.

74
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,160
But the thread
that holds the pearls together

75
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,320
has to remain hidden as it is
the base of those pearls.

76
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Similarly, a sacrifice
has to be made

77
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,290
by the royal family first.

78
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,090
Because it is the base
of the subjects.

79
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,180
Kunti shall not
go to Indraprastha.

80
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,320
This is my firm decision.

81
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,990
God bless you!

82
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,180
God bless you,
King of Anga.

83
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,950
You're a generous
and capable Arya.

84
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,130
I'm not a generous person, sage.

85
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,130
I give alms only because
my father has said

86
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,120
that there's nothing superior
than giving alms.

87
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,210
Giving alms purifies the soul.

88
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,150
Unfortunately

89
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,220
certain events
keep occurring in my life

90
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,060
that makes my soul impure.

91
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,220
God bless you!

92
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,090
Vrushali.

93
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,960
You're here!

94
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,180
Accept my apology,
Your Majesty.

95
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,030
I'm here to make a request
to you.

96
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,030
There was a time when my house
was adjacent to yours.

97
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,080
Considering that relationship

98
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,960
if you can be kind enough...
- Yes, continue.

99
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,920
What is it?

100
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,130
Ask the crown prince to allow me
to meet my father.

101
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,860
The crown prince is your friend,
isn't he?

102
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,120
But aren't you going
to Indraprastha

103
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,950
with Queen Mother?

104
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,990
The king has prohibited
Queen Mother

105
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,920
from going to Indraprastha.

106
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,930
She can't attend the inaugural
ceremony of Indraprastha.

107
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,890
That's impossible!

108
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Such grave unrighteousness!

109
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,120
The crown prince can't
be so immoral.

110
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,960
I...

111
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,850
I must talk to him.

112
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,920
You may go, Vrushali.

113
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,090
Don't worry.

114
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,020
You shall definitely go
to Indraprastha.

115
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,990
Very soon.

116
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,010
This is my promise to you.

117
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,820
Victory!

118
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,010
Karna, my friend!

119
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,020
Welcome, dear friend.

120
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,950
You've displayed
great resolve and capability

121
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,050
in front of the subjects today.

122
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,020
I'm extremely elated.

123
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,790
If I weren't the reason
for your happiness today

124
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,930
I would have been
very happy, friend.

125
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,890
To get
the credit of unrighteousness

126
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,020
is not a matter to rejoice.

127
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,050
Unrighteousness?

128
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,020
What's the reason behind
your statement?

129
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,880
Which unrighteousness
has taken place today?

130
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,790
To hold someone's mother
as captive

131
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,850
and to avenge her sons

132
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,850
is unrighteousness, my friend.

133
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,600
To hold someone's mother
as captive

134
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,660
and to avenge her sons

135
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,630
is unrighteousness, my friend.

136
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,540
That unrighteousness
is visible to you, friend.

137
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,400
But didn't you see
the immorality

138
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,500
that was inflicted upon me?
- Definitely, yes.

139
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,530
I'm ready to fight
with the entire world for that.

140
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,540
But, friend, even when the king
mounts an elephant

141
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,470
he mounts on its back,
not on its head.

142
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,660
The elephant's head
is always virtuous

143
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,500
because it's similar to Lord Ganesh's* head.
*Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom.

144
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,400
The enemy's mother
is equally virtuous, my friend.

145
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,440
I understand
your predicament, friend.

146
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,510
But this is politics.

147
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,400
We build castles for protection,
don't we?

148
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,640
Consider Lady Kunti
as one of the castles, friend.

149
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,370
The bricks used to build castles
don't have a heart.

150
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,500
A mother's heart weeps.

151
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,500
And the fire that arises
from this faintheartedness

152
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,630
burns all the happiness
to ashes, friend.

153
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,530
You had attempted to burn
Lady Kunti alive in Varnavrat.

154
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,400
That was highly iniquitous.

155
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,600
Fortunately, she was alive.

156
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,390
Now

157
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,560
don't separate Lady Kunti
from her sons, friend.

158
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,460
My friend

159
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,570
why are you advocating

160
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,530
on behalf of the enemies today?

161
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
It's because enmity
is sustained with warriors.

162
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,570
May the woman, child, cow
or a rustic farm

163
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,430
belong to any country.

164
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,490
Causing harm to them
is considered unacceptable.

165
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,370
Whose side are you on, Karna?

166
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,560
Did you forget that I had
made you the king of Anga?

167
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,400
When you were being insulted
in front of everyone

168
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,330
it was me who had given you
the respect and right.

169
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,270
I remember that, my friend.

170
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,470
Therefore, I've taken the oath
to protect you all my life.

171
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,440
P rote ct!

172
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,430
Is this how you
will protect me?

173
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm trying to protect you

174
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,340
from being wrongful, friend.

175
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,310
I sense unfaithfulness
in your words, Karna.

176
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,440
I have a feeling

177
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,370
that even you wish to reside
in Indraprastha now.

178
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,400
You are inferior before Arjun.

179
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,270
So, now you wish to establish

180
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,360
your glory in the world
with his support.

181
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,270
You've hurled such a grave
accusation on me, friend!

182
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,300
Since you have doubts
on my intentions

183
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,430
I shall take an oath today

184
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,370
that however the situation
pertains to be

185
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,470
I shall never plead
with Arjun for my life.

186
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,430
Neither shall I provide him
the gift of life.

187
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,370
Now, do you believe
my faithfulness?

188
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,330
Kindly release Lady Kunti
from captivity.

189
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,360
Impossible!

190
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,460
Children!

191
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,200
King of Anga...

192
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,300
Dear King!

193
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,190
A kingdom can't be ruled

194
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,400
only on the basis of the
principles of righteousness.

195
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,170
You're a king.

196
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,300
You must support
unrighteous deeds at times

197
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,170
as well as
be unrighteous at times.

198
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,430
If that's how it is...

199
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,170
If that's how it is

200
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,170
then please permit to remove
this crown, Prince.

201
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Prince, today I feel

202
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,050
that you're avenging
the injustice done to you

203
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,890
by committing
this act of immorality.

204
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,090
You have the right to do so.

205
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,010
But if I support you in this act

206
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,850
then, perhaps

207
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,950
it's the greed for this crown
that would make me do it.

208
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,910
But, I...

209
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,850
I'll not be able to survive
under this burden.

210
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,050
I...

211
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,920
I don't wish to become
the king of Anga.

212
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,920
I want to become
a commoner, friend.

213
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,850
Please forgive me.

214
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,950
Are you giving me this

215
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,010
in return of my favours?

216
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,850
Charioteer's son!

217
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,920
Please don't be indignant,
my friend.

218
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,720
I shall forever be your armour.

219
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,880
At your single command

220
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,750
I shall accept
a hundred deaths.

221
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,950
But to serve you

222
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
it's not important for me
to remain a king.

223
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,860
I'm not contended
with your answer.

224
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,790
I'm contended.

225
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
I'm contended with the answer.

226
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,720
My dear,
if Karna doesn't wish

227
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,920
it's not right
to forcefully stop him.

228
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
Not the king of Anga

229
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,920
but the great charioteer, Karna.

230
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,690
You're just tied
to the bond of friendship.

231
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,720
You're free from the burden
of ruling the kingdom.

232
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm grateful to you
for your kindness.

233
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,650
King of Gandhar.

234
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,790
May I make a request
for one last time?

235
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Of course,
the great charioteer Karna!

236
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,880
Kindly allow Vrushali
to go to Indraprastha.

237
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,880
I had promised her
depending on my friendship.

238
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,680
And that promise would certainly
be fulfilled, Karna.

239
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,690
The girl is free to go,
charioteer.

240
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,620
I shall take the king's fury.

241
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,810
You may go.

242
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,590
Greetings!
- Greetings!

243
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,650
Uncle!
- My dear

244
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,590
the sword is sharpened
before the battle.

245
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,690
Everyday,
if you sharpen the sword

246
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,780
it will become so brittle

247
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,590
that it will break
during the battle.

248
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,820
If your friend continued

249
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,660
to preach about unrighteousness

250
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,750
he shall very soon

251
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,590
lose his capability as well.
