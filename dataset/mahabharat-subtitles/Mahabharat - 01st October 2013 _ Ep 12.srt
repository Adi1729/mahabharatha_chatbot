1
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,593
There are five steps here,
brother

2
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,497
and the wedding rituals
will be conducted over there.

3
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:51,465
I can feel the presence
of a lot of people, Pandu.

4
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,479
People from the entire Kuru
empire have come here, brother.

5
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:01,546
After all, it is the wedding
of their future king.

6
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,610
Many sacrificial altar
have been made here.

7
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:07,352
The entire place has been
adorned with flowers.

8
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,359
I sensed that, Pandu.

9
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,522
I can smell the tuberoses,
garlands of magnolias.

10
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:14,588
You are unparalleled, brother!

11
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:18,433
Sometimes, l close my eyes

12
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:20,527
and try to identify
the objects around me

13
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:22,566
but it is futile.

14
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:25,433
Pandu

15
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:30,574
the way a blind person cannot
see again with his eyes opened.

16
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:33,584
Similarly, one cannot close
one's eyes

17
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,384
and become blind.

18
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:41,581
Flowers have been scattered
from here to the entrance.

19
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,487
The Princess of Gandhar will
come from there for the wedding.

20
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:57,339
How much longer till the
wedding ceremony, Pandu?

21
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:03,537
Pandu?

22
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:09,410
Pandu. - The Kuru Prince
seems impatient to get married.

23
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:11,419
Do not be so restless, prince.

24
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,423
When the bride
enters this place

25
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,585
you shall definitely hear
the sound of her anklets.

26
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:24,560
Pardon me, brother.

27
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:26,536
I had to go receive the aged
and blind Yadav.

28
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:29,539
I do not need your help.

29
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,375
I can hear pretty well.

30
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:36,437
I shall hear Gandhari's anklets
when she arrives here.

31
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:40,351
Before you hear her anklets,
you shall hear the accolades.

32
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:43,612
But I think, you will hear
only her anklets.

33
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,513
Long live Princess Gandhari!

34
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:20,319
Long live Princess Gandhari!

35
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,416
Long live Princess Gandhari!

36
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,519
Long live Princess Gandhari!

37
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:27,428
Long live Princess Gandhari!

38
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:29,591
Long live Princess Gandhari!

39
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,529
Long live Princess Gandhari!

40
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,437
Long live Princess Gandhari!

41
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,566
Long live Princess Gandhari!

42
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:40,543
Long live Princess Gandhari!

43
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,409
Long live Princess Gandhari!

44
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,540
Long live Princess Gandhari!

45
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,416
Long live Princess Gandhari!

46
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:51,354
Long live Princess Gandhari!

47
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:12,476
Pandu

48
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,602
I can hear her anklets.

49
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:25,418
You were right, Pandu.

50
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:28,415
I can only hear her anklets.

51
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:36,361
But..

52
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:40,529
But why did the other sounds
die out, Pandu?

53
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:00,352
Pandu

54
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:01,583
what is happening here?

55
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,551
Why isn't anyone
saying anything?

56
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:08,429
Stop!

57
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,488
What kind of a joke is this?

58
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,400
Why have you tied a cloth
over your eyes?

59
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:01,607
Pandu

60
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:05,522
what is Queen Mother saying?

61
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:06,545
It is true, brother.

62
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:10,551
The Princess of Gandhar has
covered her eyes with a cloth.

63
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,443
Pardon my daughter, Queen Mother

64
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,571
but she has taken an oath

65
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,614
of keeping her eyes covered
for the rest of her life.

66
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:46,621
She will keep her eyes covered
for the rest of her life!

67
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:50,525
King of Gandhar,
what is the meaning of all this?

68
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:53,435
She has taken an oath,
Queen Mother.

69
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:56,531
We tried our best
to dissuade her

70
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,344
but she refuses
to break her oath.

71
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:07,450
How dare you mock the
descendants of the Kuru dynasty!

72
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:09,509
We approached you
with a marriage proposal

73
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,447
and in return,
you are insulting us?

74
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,426
We do not intend to mock
or insult you, Queen Mother.

75
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,552
Then what is all this?

76
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:19,420
Betrayal?

77
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,432
When Bheeshma had come to
Gandhar with the proposal

78
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,466
you never said

79
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:27,628
that your daughter had decided
to take such an oath.

80
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:38,343
If the girl cannot become
Dhritarashtra's vision

81
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,413
then she is of no use to us.

82
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:47,516
Pardon my daughter, Queen Mother

83
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:51,623
but.. - A woman who mocks
my blindness

84
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:54,591
can never become my wife!

85
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:06,407
I reject this woman!

86
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,556
I have left my father's home
behind, my lord

87
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:31,362
to become your better half.

88
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:36,372
If you reject me

89
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,367
then I will have to enter
the holy fire.

90
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,346
My child

91
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,413
if you are here to get married

92
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:54,424
then what is the reason
behind the blindfold?

93
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,427
You should know

94
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,528
that the Kuru prince
needs a wife

95
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,432
who can become his vision.

96
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:08,504
A true wife is one
who completes her husband.

97
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:13,602
Accept my greetings,
grandfather.

98
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,346
I do not consider my lord
to be incomplete.

99
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,384
That is why, the question of
completing him does not arise.

100
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:25,455
To me, my lord is not incomplete

101
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,490
but just a little different
from the rest.

102
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,391
And in order to become
his true mate

103
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:33,362
I must accept
this different lifestyle.

104
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,003
To me, my lord is not incomplete

105
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,101
but just a little different
from the rest.

106
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:48,968
And in order to become
his true mate

107
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,842
I must accept
this different lifestyle.

108
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:58,919
My culture
teaches me, grandfather

109
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:02,118
that I have no right to see
and be blessed with vision

110
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,019
when my husband cannot..
- The task of

111
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:09,089
familiarizing your husband
with the scenes of the world

112
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,966
is yours, Gandhari.

113
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:16,105
Greetings, Queen Mother.

114
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,099
Even a servant
can accomplish this task

115
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:23,971
but the feelings
of a blind person

116
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:27,007
can be understood
only by another.

117
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:35,887
And how can a marital life be
complete if a husband and wife

118
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:37,119
cannot understand each other's
joy and sorrow.

119
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,964
We only see a serpent
crawl on the ground

120
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:46,933
but how it is able
to morph its form

121
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:49,968
is something that we
cannot understand.

122
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,869
Because in the process
of understanding another being

123
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,933
our experiences form
the major obstacle.

124
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,850
I know what it feels like
to be able to see

125
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:05,886
and as long as my vision
continues to dictate my life

126
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:09,982
I will not be able to feel
the emotions of my lord.

127
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:16,030
That is why I have decided
to sacrifice my vision

128
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,829
forever.

129
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,067
Before taking such an oath

130
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,040
you should have given this
more thought, my child.

131
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:34,878
But thoughts give birth
only to a decision.

132
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:38,109
An oath is born from the pure
feelings of one's heart.

133
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:42,988
Thoughts can be
clouded by deceit

134
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,889
but never an oath.

135
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,868
Pardon my impudence, grandfather

136
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:59,974
but who else can know
more about oaths than you?

137
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,965
Give me your blessings

138
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:27,000
to help me soak the pain
of my husband's heart

139
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:29,037
into my own.

140
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,101
Give me the blessing that
whenever my husband is hurt

141
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,002
I feel the pain instead of him.

142
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:45,052
I pray to you to accept me
as your daughter-in-law

143
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:47,012
and to bless me
with the opportunity

144
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:49,990
to bless the Kuru dynasty
with 100 illustrious sons.

145
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,093
And give me the opportunity

146
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,130
to accept the darkness
of my husband's life

147
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:05,932
and bestow him with the
fruits of my penance.

148
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:09,868
After hearing all this

149
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:12,003
what is your decision now,
grandfather?

150
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,948
Long live Princess Gandhari!

151
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,010
Long live Princess Gandhari!

152
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,921
Long live Princess Gandhari!

153
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:23,084
Long live Princess Gandhari..

154
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:27,857
Long live Princess Gandhari!

155
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,057
Long live Princess Gandhari!

156
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,901
Long live Princess Gandhari!

157
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,062
Long live Princess Gandhari!

158
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:37,835
Long live Princess Gandhari!

159
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:40,103
Long live Princess Gandhari!

160
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,074
Kripacharya.

161
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:52,077
This is a very grim situation,
Queen Mother.

162
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,057
This act of Princess Gandhari

163
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:57,086
is neither in accordance
with our holy scriptures

164
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,094
nor is it traditional.

165
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:04,024
Even Prince Dhritarashtra
dislikes this act.

166
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,938
Fear will loom in this marriage

167
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:13,066
because when a husband and wife
do not live in harmony

168
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,877
the offspring does not
turn out well.

169
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,041
To have a good progeny

170
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:23,916
it is necessary for the couple
to have love for each other.

171
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:25,920
But even Princess Gandhari

172
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:28,081
has taken a terrible oath,
my lord!

173
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,892
It is believed by wise sages

174
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,054
that an oath always
goes against traditions

175
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:38,089
because no oath is required
for what is traditional.

176
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,961
But it is also true that an oath
opens up new horizons

177
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:45,107
which eventually take
the form of a tradition.

178
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:49,069
That is why honouring
an oath is desirable.

179
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,981
What Princess Gandhari said
in her favour

180
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,049
reflects her dedication,
great Bheeshma.

181
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:07,061
In my opinion

182
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,861
Prince Dhritarashtra should
accept Princess Gandhari

183
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:11,056
wholeheartedly.

184
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:18,005
And give her the true love
she deserves.

185
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,098
It would be appropriate.

186
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:22,103
This is in favour of Hastinapur
and the Kuru dynasty.

187
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:00,841
The marriage is now complete.

188
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,447
Sukta..

189
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:04,453
This apparel

190
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:07,496
is improper, Sukta.

191
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,334
Not proper, you say.

192
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,438
This apparel is gorgeous.

193
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,375
It has been adorned with
red rubies, yellow topaz

194
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:18,601
and sapphires.

195
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:23,573
In the light of these lamps,
these look like

196
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:27,508
innumerable suns
in the evening sky.

197
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,444
They look like?

198
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:34,359
To whom, Sukta?

199
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,587
To my lord,
all these are worthless.

200
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:41,523
Princess..

201
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:44,527
And from today, for me as well.

202
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,499
Bring some flowers
for my adornment, Sukta.

203
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,499
Fragrant

204
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:54,536
and intoxicating.

205
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:00,380
Attach small bells
to my apparels

206
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:04,350
that seem like music to my lord.

207
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:14,489
What good is all this adornment

208
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,536
if it reminds my lord
of his blindness?

209
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:41,458
Every moment in life
is a moment of decision.

210
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:45,563
At every step, one has to
decide about the next step.

211
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:47,521
And the decision..

212
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:51,392
The decision leaves
a lasting impression.

213
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:55,607
Decisions taken in the present
bring about happiness

214
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,376
or sadness in the future,
not just for oneself

215
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:01,605
but for one's family

216
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,449
and the future generations too.

217
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:07,482
When one is faced with a dilemma

218
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,612
the heart becomes distraught

219
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:11,581
and is filled with indecision.

220
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,417
The moment of decision
becomes a battle

221
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,463
and the heart becomes
a battlefield.

222
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:24,500
We take most decisions not to
find a solution to a problem

223
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,572
but to calm one's heart.

224
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,535
But can one eat while running?

225
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:37,382
No.

226
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:40,476
Then, can a heart
in a state of battle

227
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,580
take the correct decision?

228
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,354
In reality

229
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,518
when one takes a decision
with a calm mind

230
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,429
he ensures a happy
future for himself.

231
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:55,533
But

232
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:59,563
when one takes a decision
to calm his heart

233
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:03,600
it will invariably cause him
pain and misery in the future.

234
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,539
Think about it.
