1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,410
Allows us to start the battle

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,390
or order us to put down
our hands!

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,260
Brother, if grandsire do not give 
his approval for battle,

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,280
will you put down your weapon?

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,350
Indeed!

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,380
Sire!

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,310
Issue an order to give up!

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,190
Sire! You know that 
in this battlefield

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,260
the right to issue orders
on behalf of my father

10
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,320
has been given to me!

11
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,320
Heed my order

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,220
and get them to give up!

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,350
This is an order from the chief commander!
- Duryodhana!

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,290
My body is bound to serve
Hastinapur throne!

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,090
My heart is bound 
and so too my mind...

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,210
But my mind is constrained by my duty.

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,190
Only my soul is free

18
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,210
like any other souls!

19
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,210
My soul can't issue

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,250
command or permission!

21
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,120
That very soul can 
give rise to both curse

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,150
or gift.

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,210
Sons of Pandu!

24
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,350
I bestow my blessings to you!

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,110
In this war

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,020
punish all your enemies to death!

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,250
Uphold justice!

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,060
Go forward and kill me!

29
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,180
May you be victorious!

30
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,010
Please, your majesty!
Your majesty!

31
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,920
Her Majesty has organized 'Mrityunjay'* chant...
*Special mantra for Mahadev/Shiva.

32
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,920
Majesty, tread carefully!

33
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,110
Her Majesty has hosted
a 'Mrityunjay'

34
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,010
and offerings of milk!

35
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,920
Even in unknown surroundings,

36
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,050
I've never tripped.

37
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,080
But, these days...

38
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,890
My own royal chamber is like getting 
in my way, Sanjay!

39
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,850
It is evident today

40
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,140
that in the truest sense

41
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,920
I have turned blind,
Sanjay!

42
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,020
Today, in the truest sense
I have turned blind.

43
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,820
Brother!

44
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,890
Great Sage Vyas has arrived!

45
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,980
Greetings, great sage!
- May you be prosperous!

46
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Gandhari!

47
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Great sage!

48
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,820
Today I long to hear
a few words from you!

49
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,960
Please help me reassure my heart.

50
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,790
I don't have any knowledge on how

51
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,780
to instill courage in yourself,
Majesty.

52
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm just here to deliver
an unfortunate news.

53
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,990
Her majesty Satyavati
unfortunately has passed away!

54
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
Oh sage!

55
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,890
Her majesty's passed away!
- Yes, Vidur!

56
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,820
Animals and birds
afraid of the dark.

57
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,950
Therefore, they close their eyes
when the sun sets.

58
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,020
Now the whole Aryan clan
and Kuru dynasty

59
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,980
will sink into a terrible darkness!

60
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,860
I have a request, your majesty,

61
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,990
that it is time for you to move on 
for the next world!

62
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,890
Her majesty was the ruler
of the Kuru dynasty.

63
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,850
Therefore I have brought
her urn.

64
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,910
Here,

65
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,690
please accept it, Dhritarashtra.

66
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,690
You will receive more of
such ash urn, majesty!

67
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,850
Her majesty Satyavati leads a good life, that's 
why she has a long life.

68
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,690
Why is your hands are shaking while
receiving her urn?

69
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,710
Learning this news, how can you bear
the death of countless youth?

70
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,950
What will be my sons' fate,
sage?

71
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,660
Who will win
in this war?

72
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,720
What is the future
of the Kuru dynasty?

73
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,760
I want to know, great sage!

74
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,860
We sculpt our future
with our past, majesty!

75
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,680
If you want to know the future

76
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,750
then comprehend this moment.
Understand it,

77
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,750
then you will finally know the future.

78
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,780
If you desire to witness this battle

79
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,820
I will grant you a divine vision!

80
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,650
Come and sit right here,

81
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,580
you can watch what is happening at Kurukhsetra.

82
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,750
No, great sage!

83
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,550
No!

84
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,790
I do not have the courage like that anymore.

85
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,810
Gandhari

86
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,710
do you want to have this divine vision?

87
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,580
No, great sage!

88
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,620
With the oath that I had made,

89
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,590
I have not witnessed joy
throughout life.

90
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,550
So, now

91
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,580
why would I watch
the face of death?

92
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,550
I...

93
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,590
I've cloaked myself
with the veil of hope!

94
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,560
So I do not need to 
face realities!

95
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,620
So...

96
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,610
So I do not need to know the truth!

97
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,550
Vidur

98
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,520
do you want to have this divine vision?

99
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,580
I'm sorry, great sage!

100
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,550
If I wanted to watch
destruction

101
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,550
I will surely now present
on the battlefield.

102
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,710
Great sage!

103
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,490
If you feel that it is fate,

104
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
then please grant me with 
that divine vision,

105
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,750
through Sanjay.

106
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,490
I will hear the progress
of battle from him.

107
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Sanjay!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

108
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,490
Always sow the seeds of enmity,

109
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,620
always satisfied with arrogance, 
that is who you are, majesty.

110
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,520
Maybe it is time for you to 
witness the results of it all.

111
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,650
This vision seems like enemy to the other eyes,

112
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,420
am I right, majesty?

113
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,190
Sanjay, I give you

114
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,250
this divine vision.

115
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,990
Vasudev!

116
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,950
Krishna...

117
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,050
Before the conch is blown

118
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,950
I want to check the army
from both sides.

119
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,150
Please drive the chariot slowly 
in between of the two armies!

120
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,900
What do you want to see, Arjun?

121
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,840
To which direction will you see?

122
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,740
And what do you want to confirm?

123
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,940
Today, why do you want

124
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
to observe the whole army in the battlefield?

125
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,780
I want to observe the enemy's army, Krishna!

126
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,800
And my own troops as well.

127
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,840
I want to know

128
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,850
in this war, whose death
will establish justice,

129
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,850
and whose death will uphold injustice.

130
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,900
I just want to know

131
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,770
what would I accomplish in this terrible war

132
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,710
and what would I lose.

133
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,940
You have made sacrifice just coming 
to this battlefield, Arjun.

134
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,750
So, why do you ponder over
gains and losses in vain?

135
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,830
A charity is one

136
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,750
where the donor loses
and seekers profit.

137
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,880
But the sacrifice is one

138
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,740
where donors give and all the world benefit!

139
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,900
However, Madhav!

140
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,770
I'm not here for charity.

141
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,640
Countless soldiers here are to lay down their lives.

142
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,810
I want to make sure
if in this great battle

143
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,680
whether I would
destroy injustice

144
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,840
or along I will jeopardize justice too.

145
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,680
You will do all of this now, Arjun?

146
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,610
Do you have the power of creation and destruction?

147
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,840
Supreme God himself effects creation 
and destruction, Arjun!

148
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,870
You are a mere means!

149
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,770
Why do you intend to bear
responsibility to yourself

150
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,680
and let your vanity grows?

151
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,680
I have told you, Arjun!

152
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,780
People who learn the fact that he 
does not own anything

153
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,640
is one to achieve something important!

154
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,810
Maybe you forgot.

155
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,700
Therefore see it, Arjun!

156
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,810
Go ahead and look
what you want to!

157
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,740
Because if the donor's hand tremble 
before doing charity,

158
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,550
actions are not taken into account
in the truest sense!
