1
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,720
Great-grandsire, please accept 
my greetings.

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,980
If I meet you at home, I would've
asked for your blessings.

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,780
But we meet on the battlefield,

4
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,060
therefore, I ask you to fight me.

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,580
Who are you, lad?

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,980
Where did you get your ability

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,720
and courage to face me?

8
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,970
Who are you, warrior?

9
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm son of Pandu's son, Arjun

10
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,060
with Yadava's daughter, Subhadra.

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,720
Abhimanyu.

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,120
My dear uncle is Krishna.

13
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,500
And today

14
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,380
I'm here on this battlefield
to challenge death.

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
Why don't you attack me, 
Great-grandsire?

16
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,330
No, child.

17
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,120
I can't attack you.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,330
At this age, when you should be
learning knowledge

19
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,860
instead you have to
face us in battle.

20
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,580
This sight saddens me.

21
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,690
In relation with my family tree.

22
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,880
A new, healthy sprout.

23
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,260
Like a golden crown.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
The new generation

25
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,020
shines.

26
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,300
That's what my dream is.

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,640
But today,

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,380
seeing the battlefield,

29
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,060
I feel that our family will soon perish.

30
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,740
I feel my whole life is a waste, child.

31
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,510
A great-grandfather endows knowledge

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,150
to his great-grandchildren.

33
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,940
He doesn't punish them.

34
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,380
You are my great-grandson.

35
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,620
I can only love you.

36
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,120
How can I possibly hurt you?

37
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,830
Go, child. Go away.

38
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,790
I, your great-grandson, do not 
admit defeat.

39
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,650
I won't go.

40
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,500
I admit my defeat, child.

41
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,530
Even the fact that I have 
to fight you,

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,480
instead of that, I choose to give in.

43
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,960
A family in which the youth dies,

44
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,000
would be felt lonely like 
a ruin of fire

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,880
inhabited by elders with 
deep guilts.

46
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,120
If only I were not under my oath,

47
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,420
then in this instance,

48
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,740
I would've given up my weapons
and become a hermit.

49
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,640
Go, child.

50
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,680
Don't challenge me. Go.

51
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,300
I'm like an arrow from Arjuna's Gandiva.

52
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,660
Once shot from the bow, it won't
get back to its storage.

53
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Fight me.
Fight me, Great-grandsire!

54
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,800
Your great-grandfather commands you

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,230
to go from here.

56
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Go!

57
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm sorry, Great-grandsire,

58
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,080
you are my enemy.

59
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,620
I can't follow your orders.

60
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,700
My child,

61
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,620
the sun will soon sets.

62
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,780
Everyone's engaged.

63
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,780
Now. We have to go to Yudishthira.

64
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,920
We won't have a better chance.

65
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
He is alone, brother.

66
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,800
Charioteer, let's go.

67
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,820
I ask you, dear.

68
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,830
Go.
- No.

69
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,280
Dushasana, brother Yudishthira holds a spear.

70
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,740
The rule of war is clear.

71
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,370
A warrior can fight other warrior

72
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,100
only if they wield the same weapon.

73
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,820
Either you raise a spear,

74
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,060
or brother Yudishthira has to use a mace.

75
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,220
My dear.

76
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
Always use what suits you.

77
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,240
And use weapon,

78
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,460
that you're good at.

79
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,620
Use this brother Yudishthira.

80
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,300
So that you won't taint our name by saying

81
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,180
that we have broken the rule.

82
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,460
Your character is such that
even soiled and defiled,

83
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,940
it doesn't matter.

84
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,320
Unfortunately, Dushasana do not even
worried about his name.

85
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
Prince Arjuna, go and protect Emperor Yudishthira.

86
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,220
A warrior has to fight more than
one opponents,

87
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,080
is this not violating the rule, uncle?

88
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,420
You've told us to not worried about
defiling our names.

89
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,060
But it's not about that.

90
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,460
We are now worried about
our advantage.

91
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,780
We have to apologize for this action.

92
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,020
For our various unrighteous actions,
brother Yudishthira

93
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,560
We will apologize for this unrighteous act.

94
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,760
But only after killing you.

95
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,040
Won't you heed an old man
request, dear?

96
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,600
Go back.

97
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Great-grandsire.

98
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,740
Protecting uncle Yudishthira is my duty.

99
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,540
So why do you

100
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,400
advise me otherwise?

101
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,900
Your courage is praiseworty, dear.

102
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,980
When you rule over all Aryan region,

103
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,940
I will be the proudest watcher from heaven.

104
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
King Madra, the sun almost sets.

105
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,240
The great Bhisma has returned.
We have to kill Yudishthira.

106
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,000
Attack him.

107
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,800
I can't attack behind his back,
evil Shakuni!

108
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,300
Like a crow, you are used to
disgusting life

109
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,620
but not me.
- A swan that live among crows

110
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,460
is just as disgusting, King Madra.

111
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,580
Not pure as well.

112
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,500
You have promised.

113
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,420
You have pledged loyalty to Duryodhana.

114
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,860
To help Duryodhana emerges victorious,

115
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
is you duty.

116
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,180
Attack him.

117
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,020
Throw your spear, King Madra!

118
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,420
Attack him!
