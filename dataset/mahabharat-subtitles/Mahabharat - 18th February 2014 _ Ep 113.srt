1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,180
Stop!

2
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,280
What are you doing,
Dhritarashtra?

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,440
Who permitted you
to make Duryodhan King?!

4
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Permission!

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Does the King of Hastinapur

6
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,180
seek permission before
taking decisions, Your Highness?

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,180
Be quiet, King of Gandhar!

8
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,140
I, son of Shantanu,
Devavrat Bhishma

9
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,270
always walk ahead
the King of Hastinapur!

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,270
This is my oath!

11
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,240
By walking ahead
on the righteous path

12
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,180
I guide and protect
the King of Hastinapur!

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,140
And as he is on
an unrighteous path

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,370
I am blocking his way
and protesting against him!

15
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,340
That is why...

16
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,370
That is why, seeking
my permission is mandatory.

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,110
But great Bhishma

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,250
how can you obstruct
an action of the King?

19
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,210
You have taken an oath

20
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,340
of not going against Hastinapur

21
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,110
and taking to arms.

22
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,070
I have taken the oath

23
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,170
to make sure that
the throne of Hastinapur

24
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,250
is presided over by a competent
and righteous King.

25
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,080
And if I see an unrighteous King
on the throne of Hastinapur

26
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
then I shall
indeed take to arms!

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,130
And this

28
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,240
does not break my oath.

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,210
Does anyone have the competence

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,250
to stand up against me?!

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,110
Pardon me, great Bhishma

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,110
but if I am ordered
by the King of Hastinapur

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,140
then I shall indeed
demonstrate my competence.

34
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,040
I do not know

35
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,070
if I will be victorious
on my friend's behalf or not

36
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,080
but in order to protect him

37
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,030
I am prepared to sacrifice
even my life.

38
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,170
Dhritarashtra!

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,210
Before the anointment ceremony

40
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,080
order the King of Anga

41
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,010
to take to arms!

42
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,070
And let Prince Duryodhan know

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,100
that when it is time
to crush unrighteousness

44
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,950
how fiercely I,
Devavrat Bhishma, fight!

45
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,040
No, uncle!
No!

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,140
There was no intention
to insult you.

47
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,940
But uncle

48
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,140
I wish to transfer the duties
of the kingdom to my son

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,980
and resort to asceticism.

50
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,170
You may certainly do so.

51
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,110
You are the Acting King

52
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,170
and you may make
your son the same.

53
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,110
But you cannot make him King.

54
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,050
Why can he not do so,
great Bhishma?

55
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,170
There must be a reason.

56
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,950
When he has already been
made the Crown Prince

57
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,010
then what can be the problem

58
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,170
in declaring him the King?

59
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,140
Duryodhan's coronation
as the Prince holds no value.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How can it not hold
any value, grandsire?

61
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,070
You had permitted me
to be coronated as the Prince.

62
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,150
But the first one to be
coronated as the Prince

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,100
was Yudhishthir.

64
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,040
The five brothers have died
in Varnavrat, grandsire.

65
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,110
When the first Crown Prince
is not alive

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,140
then I am next in line
to be the Crown Prince.

67
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,940
The first Crown Prince

68
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,040
is alive.

69
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,070
Are

70
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,910
you telling the truth, uncle?

71
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,140
The sons of Pandu are alive?

72
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,950
The 'swayamvar' of the daughter
of the King of Panchal

73
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,910
was witnessed
by Duryodhan himself.

74
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,950
Was it not
a difficult competition?

75
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,870
Can the winner
of that competition

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,100
be an ordinary 'Brahmin?'

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,880
That was indeed Arjun.

78
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,050
And if Arjun is alive

79
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,040
then so is Yudhishthir.

80
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,880
Do you believe now,
Dhritarashtra

81
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,810
that making Duryodhan King
is unrighteous?

82
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,780
Now, if

83
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,940
Yudhishthir is alive

84
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,900
then making Duryodhan King

85
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,000
is no longer possible.

86
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,810
Then where are the sons
of Pandu, great Bhishma?

87
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,800
If the sons of Pandu are alive

88
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,740
then do bring them here.

89
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,840
Vidur has gone to Kampilya

90
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,870
to bring them here.

91
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,900
How can we believe

92
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,010
that the Minister
has gone to Kampilya?

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,950
He did not seek the permission
of His Highness before leaving.

94
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,780
And even the timpani
were not heard

95
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,880
as a sign of a message
being received.

96
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,740
They shall indeed return.

97
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Soon.

98
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,940
How many days?

99
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,900
How many years?

100
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
His Highness

101
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,970
there must certainly
be a time limit.

102
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,810
Yes!

103
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,780
There must be
a time limit, uncle.

104
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,880
Two days, three days, a week?

105
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
If the sons of Pandu
do not return within a week

106
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,840
or if there is no news of them

107
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,940
then Duryodhan will certainly

108
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,940
be made the King, uncle.

109
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,870
And at that time

110
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,780
you too must accept
this decision, uncle.

111
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,710
Not a week...

112
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,610
Not even a day, Your Highness.

113
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,640
Listen.

114
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,650
The welcome ceremony
of Crown Prince Yudhishthir

115
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,680
has already begun.

116
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,770
The Pandavas have
reached Hastinapur.

117
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,780
Righteousness is returning
to Hastinapur.

118
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,470
Greetings, His Highness.

119
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,610
Bless you, dear.

120
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Greetings, Her Highness.

121
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,680
Bless you!

122
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,680
Dear Yudhishthir

123
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,510
if all of you were alive

124
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,480
then why did you not return?

125
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,480
Aunt

126
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,350
when something seems righteous

127
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,620
I try my best

128
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,610
to fulfill it with
complete devotion.

129
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,450
Then why did you

130
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,450
change your mind now, dear?

131
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,580
Uncle

132
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,470
during the monsoons

133
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,420
the same plant first
gives birth to new leaves

134
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,450
then to flowers,
to fruits

135
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,550
and in the end, to seeds.

136
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,540
A plant judiciously follows
the schedule of seasons

137
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,570
and a righteous person

138
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,440
follows the path of truth.

139
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,410
Greetings, grandsire.

140
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,580
May you live long!

141
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,440
I have protected
the throne of Hastinapur

142
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,510
so that righteousness

143
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,320
may preside over it
in your form.

144
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,510
Greetings, His Highness.

145
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,350
Bless you, dear!

146
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,380
During the exile,
Lord Ram

147
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,490
had adopted the lifestyle
and mentality of his subjects.

148
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,380
That is why,
he proved to be a fine King.

149
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,280
That is why, we decided
that if brother Yudhishthir

150
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,550
stays in the woods as a common
man amongst the subjects

151
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,350
then he too will prove to be
a fine King in the future.

152
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,440
Greetings, uncle.

153
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,470
Arjun

154
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,280
I have heard that a competition

155
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,390
which could be won only by you,
was organized in Kampilya.

156
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,380
And because of your blessings

157
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,480
I could augment the honour
of Hastinapur, uncle.

158
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,370
Greetings.

159
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,270
Bless you!

160
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,480
Where is Kuru dynasty's
first daughter-in-law, Arjun?

161
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,250
Not the first, Her Highness.

162
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,340
Second daughter-in-law.

163
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,410
During the exile,
brother Bheem

164
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,480
had married
the sister of Hidimb.

165
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,220
And sister-in-law Hidimba

166
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,220
has also given birth to a son.

167
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,310
In other words,
brother Bheem

168
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,350
married an ogre?

169
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,380
Hastinapur, peculiar
is your morality

170
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,320
where Princes marry ogres.

171
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,380
Till the time Hidimba
resides in the woods

172
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,410
you may deem her your wife.

173
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,350
I shall

174
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,340
not deem her son a part
of the Kuru dynasty.

175
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,110
But I can

176
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,340
certainly deem him

177
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,220
my great grandson.

178
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,310
Congratulations!

179
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,080
Greetings, sister-in-law.

180
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,240
Where is Kuru dynasty's
second daughter-in-law

181
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,270
of the next generation?

182
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,520
Where is Kuru dynasty's
second daughter-in-law

183
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
of the next generation?

184
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
This is the Princess of Panchal

185
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,480
Panchali.

186
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,580
Greetings, Her Highness.

187
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
Bless you!

188
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,450
I cannot see you

189
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,390
but your beauty must match
the competence of my Arjun

190
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,610
and I am certain of that.

191
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,510
Arjun.

192
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,580
Come forward, dear.

193
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,620
A newly married couple
is always welcomed together.

194
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,350
Her Highness

195
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,510
all five of us
need to be welcomed.

196
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,580
The five of us have got married.

197
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,480
Where are the rest
of the daughters-in-law?

198
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,310
Uncle

199
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,510
we five brothers

200
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,320
have married Draupadi.
