1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,690
Did Queen Gandhari
give birth to a lump of flesh?

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,810
Yes, Madri.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,850
A lump of flesh
has been delivered.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,650
But why, Lord?

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,720
Why is brother-in-law and
sister-in-law's life filled with

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,690
so much of
sorrows and grievances?

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,740
Not just them

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,750
the whole of Hastinapur
and the entire Kuru clan

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,850
is a victim of this misfortune.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,880
Even your son
Yudhisthir, Kunti.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,810
Yudhisthir's misfortune!

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,820
My father used to say...
Only an unfortunate king

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,780
lacks a brother or a kin
for his protection.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,590
A lone tree gets uprooted
easily during a storm.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,750
If it is in a group,
it doesn't get uprooted.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,650
Kunti

17
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,590
I've thought over
what Madri said.

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,780
Madri is absolutely right.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,590
Now that Yudhisthir
is the future of Hastinapur

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,760
four brothers are also required
for his protection.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,720
You have to invoke the deities
again with the help of mantras.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,750
The Kuru clan wants
four more heirs from you.

23
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,750
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

24
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,780
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

25
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,550
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,620
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,650
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

28
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,710
Hail Lord Mahadev!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

29
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,710
Let's go, Sanjay.

30
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,750
Why did you stop, Sanjay?

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,720
Who has obstructed my way?
- It's sire Bheeshma, King.

32
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,680
King, I've learnt that
you've set up an army

33
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,750
to attack someone.
- Yes.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,460
I am going to
conquer everything!

35
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,690
East, West, North, South!

36
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,580
I've taken an oath
to extend my kingdom all over!

37
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,650
I can't give you
permission for this.

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,620
I don't need
anybody's permission!

39
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,680
I've had enough of obeying
orders and commands!

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,720
I kept following
these obligations so far!

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,680
But to no avail.

42
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,590
Now, I'll take my own decisions.

43
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,680
Disperse!

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,450
Do take your own decisions.

45
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,520
But the river which flows
with violent speed and current...

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,720
The water of such a river
is not fit for drinking.

47
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,450
When someone is enraged

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,410
he loses control
over his mind.

49
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,420
Take a decision
when you calm down.

50
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,580
I don't want to calm down!

51
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,560
What did I gain by taking
decisions while staying calm?

52
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,560
Except humiliation, disgrace
and indignity!

53
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,650
The Queen Mother got me married
to the Princess of Gandhar.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,380
It was a wise decision,
wasn't it?

55
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,410
But what did I gain?

56
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,580
What?

57
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,610
Gandhari insulted me
by blindfolding herself!

58
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,490
But still, I accepted her
at your behest.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,620
What did I gain from that,
sire?

60
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,480
What did I gain?

61
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,520
What and when has
Dhritarashtra ever gained?

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
But, Your Majesty...

63
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,350
Brother, what will you gain by
following the path of warfare?

64
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,390
I will...
I definitely will...

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,490
When the fever
is too high

66
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,460
villagers burn their hands.

67
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,350
That pain...

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,550
That pain fetches the heat out
of their bodies.

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Vidur, I am also in search
of one such pain.

70
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,460
I want to feel the pain of
wounds caused by swords.

71
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,550
So that, I don't get to hear
the lament of my heart.

72
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,420
I don't want to hear that.

73
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,420
I don't want to hear that...

74
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,560
I don't have any son.

75
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,520
My wife has delivered
a lump of flesh.

76
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,350
What sort of irony
is this?

77
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,350
Because of being blind

78
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,510
I have always been at
the mercy of people.

79
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,410
Now, am I supposed to face
their tongue-lashing as well?

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,350
What will they think of me?
What sort of a man am I

81
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,360
who is incapable of giving
a child to his wife?

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,510
I couldn't
give her a child.

83
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,460
Don't insult Mahadev
by using such words.

84
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,360
To expect a child from Gandhari
was our mistake.

85
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,510
It was my mistake.

86
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,320
I should have understood earlier

87
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,450
that it's not possible
for a woman to give birth

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,320
to a 100 children
in a single lifetime.

89
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,510
God's blessing never
goes in vain.

90
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,290
Actually, she has not given
birth to a lump of flesh.

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,550
She has delivered the source
of a 100 babies.

92
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,450
Your 100 children have taken
birth in the form of seeds.

93
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,510
Now, the person
who can bring them

94
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,290
to life is my son...
Sage Vedvyas.

95
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,120
Shakuni, what is the sage doing?

96
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,250
He has prepared
an underground cave

97
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
and named it 'Kshiti Garbha'.*
*"Earth Womb"

98
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,280
Vedvyas has said that
inside this cave

99
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,380
Gandhari's sons will get formed.

100
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,220
If he can really
perform miracles

101
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,280
then why doesn't he
cast some spell

102
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,350
and give life to my children?

103
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,210
Vedvyas doesn't
perform miracles

104
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,380
his knowledge does.

105
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,140
He is the son-in-law
of Sage Jabal*
Vedvyas' father-in-law.

106
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,290
an expert on the Atharva Veda.

107
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,310
Have faith in him.

108
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,350
He will keep his word.

109
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,220
Vedvyas has summoned
Queen Gandhari and all of you

110
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,190
to the 'Kshiti Garbha'.

111
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
Greetings, mother.

112
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,730
The 100 embryos

113
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,770
that Gandhari has blessed
the royal family with...

114
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,610
I have embedded them
in these 100 urns. Mother

115
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,830
they are all

116
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,640
floating in clarified butter
that has been specially treated.

117
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,800
And they are being
nurtured with

118
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,830
many unique miraculous
herbs.

119
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,830
When the right time comes,
in these urns

120
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,670
Gandhari's 100 children
will take birth.

121
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,800
And, Gandhari

122
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,600
when Lord Shiv blessed you
and gave you this boon

123
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,800
you must have had a desire
for a daughter too.

124
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,670
The Lord has also answered
this unspoken desire of yours.

125
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,600
A daughter will be born

126
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,600
from the 101st urn.

127
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
The first feature of a king
is his strength.

128
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,540
Yudhisthir will be known for
his good and just deeds.

129
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
And I know that.

130
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,800
But a king's deeds and
justness receive respect

131
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,560
only when he has the strength
to protect that justice.

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,540
I want a son, Kunti

133
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,610
who has the strength of
a 1000 elephants in his arms.

134
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,610
He should be like the wind,
when it comes to strength.

135
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,760
Just like when the Lord of Wind
gets angry

136
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,700
he destructs the forests,
brings about cyclones

137
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,710
he destructs mountains and
converts them to dust.

138
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,500
The same strength should be
possessed by my son, Kunti.

139
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,630
Chant the mantra and
invite the Lord of Wind, Kunti.

140
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,470
Tell me, Shakuni.

141
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,670
What does the sight
look like?

142
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,630
Is there...

143
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,700
Is there any flutter
in any of the urns?

144
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,540
Is there...

145
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,730
Is there any sign of
life visible?

146
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,630
This cave

147
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,640
is filled with the lives of my
nephews, Your Highness.

148
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,540
There's a flutter in
each of these urns.

149
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,630
Just like the one in your
brother Pandu's heart.

150
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,700
The same kind of
flutter.

151
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,490
Pandu!

152
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,540
Fluttering, in Pandu's heart?

153
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,440
Of course! Don't you
feel it, Your Highness?

154
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,630
Not just flutter but a quake.

155
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,540
There's a quake in his
heart, Your Highness.

156
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,470
His son, in spite of being
the oldest in the royal family

157
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,470
is helpless in front
of these 100 sons.

158
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,630
Just watch.

159
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,530
My 100 sons will be
his strength, Shakuni.

160
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,370
Strength!

161
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,400
Strength!

162
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,400
Strength!

163
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,370
Your 100 sons

164
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,440
will be the strength of Pandu's
son, Your Highness?

165
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,600
Then you will do
the right thing.

166
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
My dear sister

167
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,440
has deceived you,
Your Highness.

168
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,600
Instead of giving you
a 100 princes

169
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,500
she has given you a 100 ordinary
soldiers, Your Highness.

170
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,400
Who will be Pandu's son's

171
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,530
bodyguards.

172
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,470
One of them will carry
his sword for him.

173
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,570
One will hold his
fan for him.

174
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,400
And one of them will also

175
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,470
have to pick up his slippers,
Your Highness.

176
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,340
My dear sister is very evil,
Your Highness.

177
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,300
Or else, you are

178
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,500
deceiving my dear sister,
Your Highness.

179
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,470
She went through so much pain

180
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,410
and gave you a 100 princes.
And you...

181
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,270
You wish

182
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,330
to bring them up
as a 100 ordinary soldiers?

183
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,530
Who has cheated whom?

184
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm unable to understand it,
Your Highness.

185
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,270
This is a very complex question.

186
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,460
But

187
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,340
when the time comes

188
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,340
you only will have to
answer it.

189
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,030
At your invitation

190
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,930
I have appeared, Kunti.

191
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,940
I am here to fulfil the boon
of Sage Durvasa.

192
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,970
Then bless me with a son as
powerful as you, Lord.

193
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Half the body of
your son

194
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,910
is made of adamantine, Kunti.

195
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,970
I will myself reside
in his arms.

196
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,970
His enemies will shiver on
hearing of his achievements.

197
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,710
He will be very powerful.

198
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,830
The whole world will know him
by the name of Vrikodar Bheem.*
*Vrikodar: 'one with a wolf's belly'. 
Bheem: 'terrible', 'awful'.

199
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,930
My Bheem.

200
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,770
I will go and get
milk for him.

201
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,740
Bheem!

202
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Bheem!

203
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,910
Bheem...

204
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,640
My son.
