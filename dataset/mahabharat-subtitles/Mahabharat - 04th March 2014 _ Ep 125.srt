1
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,160
Madhav.

2
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,350
Indra Dev

3
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,220
do respect the
competence of Arjun

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,190
the son born
from your blessings.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,130
His competence has
augmented your glory.

6
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,160
Vasudev!

7
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,220
I have promised
to protect Dakshak.

8
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,180
And a son

9
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,060
must honour the promise
made by his father.

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,290
Even Arjun has made
a similar promise

11
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,030
to his subjects.

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,260
Why is it,
Indra Dev

13
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,060
that everyone respects
the feelings and promises

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,250
they make themselves

15
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,990
but when it comes to the
feelings and promises of others

16
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,220
people fail to value them?

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,020
But Vasudev

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,030
what if the promises made by
father and son are in conflict?

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,220
Whose promise holds
a greater value then?

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,080
Both.

21
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,990
The success of a father
bestows knowledge to his son

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,130
and that of a son
brings glory to his father.

23
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,090
It would be correct,
Indra Dev

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,990
if you aid Arjun
in being successful.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,230
Are you here
to ask for help, Arjun?

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,050
One cannot ask for help
by taking to arms.

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,150
Lord Indra

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,190
I was mere demonstrating

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,160
my art and competence
to please you.

30
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,020
But you had shot arrows at me.

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,960
You reside everywhere,
Lord Indra.

32
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,090
Is there any direction in which
I can shoot the arrows

33
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,060
in order to please you?

34
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,000
What help do you
seek from me, Arjun?

35
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,030
Before I tell you
about the help I need

36
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,920
I must tell you about
my oath, Lord Indra.

37
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,020
We shall always protect
the serpent community.

38
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,990
We shall even give them an equal
opportunity to prosper with us.

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,130
The city we shall build

40
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,890
shall gain fame by your name.

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,050
Our grand city

42
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,990
will be known as Indraprastha!

43
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,150
I am pleased,
Arjun.

44
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,920
How can I help you?

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,890
Do build the city for us

46
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,930
which we can name after you.

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,950
Your competence

48
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,950
and intelligence

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,990
have pleased me
immensely, son.

50
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,930
I will order Vishwakarma*
"All-accomplishing, maker of all," "all doer", he is the presiding deity of all craftsmen and architects.

51
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,960
to begin the construction

52
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,850
of your city.

53
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,980
Bless you!

54
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,000
Lord Indra!

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Because you love your son

56
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
today

57
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,900
you have forsaken me.

58
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,850
I take the oath

59
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,930
that the last heir
of your son's dynasty

60
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,020
shall be

61
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,930
killed by me!

62
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,950
Pardon me,
Vasudev.

63
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,760
Please pardon me.

64
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,920
I had asked Dakshak
to seek your refuge.

65
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
Mayasur

66
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,960
had you not created an
illusory forest for Dakshak

67
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,960
humans and serpents would
never have had a struggle.

68
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,960
You have extraordinary
talents, Mayasur.

69
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,760
You are like the
Vishwakarma of the ogres

70
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,890
but you did not
employ your skills

71
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,920
for the betterment of the world.

72
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,720
You employed it
for your selfish gains.

73
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
You are correct,
Vasudev.

74
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,760
I made a mistake.

75
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,920
Pardon me,
My Lord.

76
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,830
Madhav

77
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,760
you allowed Dakshak to go free.

78
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,960
I request you

79
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,690
to pardon him.

80
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,890
I allowed Dakshak to go free

81
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,760
only because you had
promised Indra Dev, friend

82
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,730
that you would
protect the serpents.

83
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,880
Mayasur.

84
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,660
Since my friend
has requested me

85
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,890
I shall pardon you,
Mayasur.

86
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
But whenever you are
required in the future

87
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,850
you must employ your skills

88
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,700
to our advantage.

89
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,750
Certainly,
Vasudev.

90
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,820
I promise you that.

91
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,850
We are alive.

92
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,580
Friend

93
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,530
pray to Agni Dev now

94
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,750
and ask him
to put this fire out.

95
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,560
Agni Dev

96
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,790
with your blessings

97
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Indraprastha has been
given a new life today.

98
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,550
I express my
heartfelt gratitude.

99
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,590
You have satiated my hunger
today, son of Pandu, Arjun.

100
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,790
I am very pleased with you.

101
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,800
It is in the nature of fire

102
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,730
that whichever object
is subjected to it

103
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,650
gets purified.

104
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,720
By devouring the illusion
of this forest

105
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,700
I have purified it.

106
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,560
And from that illusion is made
this illusory and powerful bow

107
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,530
which I present to you.

108
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,530
Like your disposition,
this bow

109
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,560
is also calm,
composed

110
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,630
and powerful.

111
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,600
That is why,
this bow

112
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,630
shall be known as
the Gandiva Bow.

113
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,790
You must worship it first
in your newly established city.

114
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,590
This bow shall multiply
your strength immensely.

115
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,490
Indra Dev has
fulfilled his promise.

116
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,430
Look over there.
The blessing of Vishwakarma.

117
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,520
Your city is being built.

118
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,560
Indraprastha.

119
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,360
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

120
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,470
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

121
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,470
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

122
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,330
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

123
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,490
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

124
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,370
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

125
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,590
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

126
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,560
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

127
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,470
All hail...
- King Yudhishthir!

128
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,520
Her Highness,
my daughter...

129
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,570
Where is my daughter Vrushali?

130
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,260
Look over there.

131
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,430
Who has been washed up
on the shore?

132
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,520
It is some woman.
Let's go.

133
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,260
Yes, let's go.

134
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,320
Oh! She is the daughter
of Vrishbhan.

135
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,490
It seems as though she is alive.

136
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,270
Let us take her to the Doctor.
Let's go.

137
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,840
Vrushali

138
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,940
are you alright?

139
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,900
Adhiratha?

140
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Yes, dear.

141
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,970
You and Vrishbhan had
gone to Indraprastha.

142
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,070
Then how did you
fall into the river?

143
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,870
Serpents had attacked us
there, Adhiratha.

144
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,840
Even...

145
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,940
Even my father was killed!

146
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,840
I...

147
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,980
I fell into the river
while trying to save myself.

148
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,840
Here you go.
Drink this.

149
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,010
No one died,
child.

150
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,860
The Pandavas have
captured the serpents

151
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,000
and compelled them
to draw the venom out.

152
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,030
Your father must be alive.

153
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,840
Then...

154
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,930
Then I should return
to Indraprastha.

155
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Adhiratha, I have to go
to Indraprastha

156
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,030
to my father.

157
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,970
I want to go there.

158
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Certainly, dear.
Certainly.

159
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,840
Most of the subjects
of Hastinapur

160
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,770
are migrating to Indraprastha.

161
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,930
You may travel with any family

162
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,800
you are familiar with.

163
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,900
Yes.
- Let's go.

164
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,740
Let me help you with that.
- Do not forget that.

165
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,970
Make haste.
- Put this on the cart too.

166
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,770
Hey... - Be careful.

167
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,710
All of us will live
in the new kingdom.

168
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,870
All of us will live in the
kingdom of King Yudhishthir.

169
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes, that's right.

170
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,810
Bring that along as well.
That would be useful.

171
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,970
Our King Yudhishthir never lies

172
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,940
and we wish to stand
by a truthful person.

173
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,770
So many people

174
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,700
are migrating to
Indraprastha, uncle?!

175
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,780
It is human nature,
my darling.

176
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,880
He hopes to find new joy

177
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,840
in the new objects he finds.

178
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,830
The water of the ocean

179
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,710
wishes to touch the sky
in the form of waves.

180
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,740
The water in the sky

181
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,740
desires to fall as rain
on the mountains.

182
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,870
And when rain falls
on the mountains

183
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,840
it rushes to meet the ocean.

184
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,830
When the Pandavas

185
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,710
were leaving with a few
of our subjects, uncle

186
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,710
you had said to let them go.

187
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,730
But now, Hastinapur
will become empty!

188
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,660
Is this

189
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
not an insult to father and me?!

190
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,730
It certainly is an insult,
my darling.

191
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,670
It certainly is an insult.

192
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,710
And it is also a major problem.

193
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,830
We must stop

194
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,670
these people from
leaving Hastinapur

195
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,760
my darling.

196
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,710
I need to meet His Highness.
