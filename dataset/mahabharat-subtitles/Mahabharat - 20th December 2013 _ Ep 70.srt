1
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,170
Now leave.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,360
Early in the morning

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,200
get Rukmini to the temple
of Goddess Parvati.*
*The wife of Shiva and the gentle aspect of Maha Devi or Durga.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,370
I will be waiting for you.

5
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,340
Hold on!

6
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,330
Who are you?

7
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm a maid.

8
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,100
I haven't seen you here before.

9
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,230
This means

10
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,160
that you keep an eye
on all the maids here.

11
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,070
It is not respectable for
a soldier. - Don't argue.

12
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,200
Nobody is permitted
to meet the princess.

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,060
I have

14
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,200
brought Maharishi Durvasa's
sacrament with me.

15
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,140
If the princess does not
have this sacrament

16
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,330
she will never
get married.

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,230
No!
You cannot go.

18
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,270
Okay, soldier, tell me

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,200
is the prince of Chedi
handsome?

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,260
Maybe.
Why?

21
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,200
Okay, I'll have this...

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,260
I'll have this sacrament.

23
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,040
Then I'll get married to him.

24
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,140
This sacrament is very powerful.

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,230
The princess cannot get married
until she has this sacrament.

26
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,100
Stop!

27
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,210
This isn't a sacrament
but an opportunity.

28
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,010
If you want,
you can have some too.

29
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,100
Go give it to the princess.

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,230
Give it a thought, Rukmini.

31
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,000
Chedi's prince Sishupal is here.

32
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,970
Tomorrow morning the wedding
ceremony will be completed.

33
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,940
Do you know what will happen if
you decide against the marriage?

34
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,200
Prince Sishupal will get upset.

35
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,970
That is why I had told you...

36
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,070
Had requested you earnestly

37
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,000
not to invite him for
the wedding.

38
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,130
Don't act foolish, Rukmini.

39
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,070
Father will be humiliated.

40
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,000
Chedi and Vidharbha
will be at war.

41
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,110
A monarch like King Jarasandh
will be angry with us.

42
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,030
Don't worry about that, brother.

43
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,040
My Lord Krishna will protect you

44
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,110
from the monarch of Magadh.

45
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,040
Krishna! Krishna!
Krishna!

46
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,910
What are you saying!

47
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,970
There

48
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,970
you too have chanted his
name thrice just now.

49
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,010
This time, your death
will surely get averted.

50
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,160
Keep quiet!

51
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,870
You will get married
to the Prince of Chedi.

52
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,870
Now don't even let the
thought of that cowherd

53
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,960
come to your mind.

54
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,060
That shall be best for you.

55
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,130
You can build a dam on
a flowing river

56
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,940
but you cannot build
a dam on falling rains.

57
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,100
Chanting Krishna's name

58
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,130
is like shower of nectar
in my life.

59
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,070
How can I stop it?

60
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,870
I'm already married, brother.

61
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,870
My Lord will arrive

62
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,100
and take me with him
to his house.

63
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,800
This is impossible, Rukmini.

64
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,930
That cowherd can't even step
into my province.

65
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,930
Look in all four
directions, brother

66
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,000
there's only Krishna
everywhere.

67
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,900
Krishna everywhere.

68
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,000
Krishna everywhere.

69
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,930
Krishna everywhere.

70
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,930
Krishna everywhere.

71
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,960
Krishna everywhere.

72
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,000
Krishna everywhere.

73
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,960
Krishna everywhere.

74
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,810
Krishna everywhere.
Krishna everywhere.

75
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,870
Krishna everywhere.

76
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,770
Krishna everywhere.

77
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,840
Krishna everywhere.

78
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,030
Krishna everywhere.

79
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,840
Krishna everywhere.

80
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,930
Rukmini!

81
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,840
Wherever I go

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
I will get closer
to my Lord.

83
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,840
Stop rambling, Rukmini!

84
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,940
You will get married
to prince Sishupal.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
You will now leave
this chamber

86
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,970
only to go to the
wedding booth.

87
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,870
Until it's the auspicious time
for the wedding

88
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
you shall not leave
this chamber.

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,730
Who are you?

90
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,830
This...

91
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,910
This is Maharishi Durvasa's
sacrament.

92
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,700
Fine! Go give it!

93
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,870
Maybe this sacrament can
reinstate some sanity to her.

94
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,670
You seem to be out of
your senses, prince.

95
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,670
Krishna has not only
entered your province

96
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,810
but your palace too.

97
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,830
I had completely forgotten

98
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,700
how beautiful peacock
feathers are.

99
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,770
I used to think

100
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,800
that they look beautiful because
they're on Krishna's crown.

101
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,860
Who are you?

102
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,730
And

103
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,600
how did you enter...
- I'm Arjun...

104
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,830
I'm cowherd, Branala...

105
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,570
You...

106
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,670
Who I am
is of no importance.

107
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,800
What's important is

108
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,660
that you had written a letter
to my brother Krishna.

109
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,600
And in that letter you
had written

110
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,640
that you will wait for him
at Goddess Parvati's temple.

111
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,730
It's time.

112
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,630
And you're still here!

113
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,670
This means

114
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,670
Krishna has arrived
on my invitation.

115
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,670
You will know that only
when you go there.

116
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,320
Please come.

117
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,630
Where are you both going?

118
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,140
Wait.

119
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,660
The princess is prohibited from
leaving the chamber.

120
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,390
Actually

121
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Maharishi Durvasa's sacrament

122
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,530
has to be consumed
by the princess

123
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,400
in Goddess Parvati's temple.

124
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,490
That's not necessary.

125
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,530
The princess will not
leave the palace.

126
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,450
As you wish.

127
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,390
But

128
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,420
Maharishi Durvasa
already knew

129
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,420
that the princess would be
against this wedding.

130
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,390
Hence

131
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
he has

132
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,490
sent this special sacrament.

133
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,590
If the princess

134
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
goes to Goddess
Parvati's temple

135
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,400
and consumes this sacrament
while performing the veneration

136
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,390
then the sacrament will
show its miracle.

137
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,490
And she will get married

138
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,550
to the one
she is supposed to.

139
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,580
Believe me, princess.

140
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,530
Fine.

141
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,450
You can go, Rukmini.

142
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,550
Even I'll come along with you.

143
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,560
No...

144
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,320
I don't want to go anywhere.

145
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,360
I don't want any sacrament.

146
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,350
I will not go.

147
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,330
Only you can convince her now.

148
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,350
Once she consumes this
sacrament at the temple

149
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
she shall forget
to protest.

150
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,390
Come on, Rukmini.

151
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,530
I told you,
I don't want to go.

152
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,330
I don't...
- Come, Rukmini.

153
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,350
I don't want to go.

154
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,750
Detain him!
- What do we do now?

155
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,810
Lord Krishna says

156
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,950
that when there is an
opportunity to run

157
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,780
one should run.

158
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Soldiers

159
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,690
that messenger shouldn't
be spared alive!

160
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,810
Catch him!

161
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,810
Princess Rukmini

162
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
you go to the temple,
I'll handle them.
