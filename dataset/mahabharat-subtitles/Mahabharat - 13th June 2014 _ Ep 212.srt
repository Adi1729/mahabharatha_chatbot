O' Madhava! O' Madhusudan*!
*Slayer Of Demon Madhu.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,670
Today, all my doubts have been
obliterated!

48
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,290
Kindly return to your human form!

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,160
I shall obey every order of yours!

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,270
"Karishye vachanam Tava (thy will be done)!"

51
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,890
Krishna, with his "Yogic" illusion,

52
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,360
has imparted the entire “Bramhic“
knowledge

53
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,540
into Arjun's mind in a single moment,
Your Majesty!

54
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,560
Even I have attained sanctity by
this knowledge.

55
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,070
I indeed feel so!

56
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,230
There is not doubt anymore

57
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,530
that Arjun, with his great power and
resilience

58
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,530
has raised his "Gandiva" bow Your
Majesty!

59
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,200
What else is happening at
"Kurukshetra", Sanjay?

60
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,960
Continue describing everything to me
in detail.

61
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,410
The Pandava army is gathering for
its first day of formation.

62
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,240
The five Pandavas, are heading east
upon their horses, Your Majesty!

63
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,860
At the foremost position of the formation all five
Pandavas are upon their chariots, Your Majesty!

64
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,930
Because they have smaller army 
on their side,

65
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,290
they have assumed such a formation

66
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,090
by which they can penetrate into our
formation

67
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,860
and reach Prince Duryodhan at the
earliest!

68
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,990
What could be such a formation,
Sanjay.

69
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,190
Which has the capability to pierce
through an entire army?

70
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,590
The biggest strength of commanders-
in-chief

71
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,270
whose formation is immensely
difficult

72
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,210
and to control which is equally
difficult!

73
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,270
The one which is terrifying as the
armour of God Indra!

74
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,240
The "Vajra" formation!

75
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,530
The Pandavas have assumed the
"Vajra" pattern, Grandsire!

76
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,440
Order our soldiers to assume our
formation!

77
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:34,100
No formation shall be assumed at
this time, Prince!

78
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,730
There shall only be a retaliation to
their attack!

79
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,170
Soldiers!

80
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,470
Attack!

81
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,270
Attack!

82
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,060
Attack!

83
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,070
Attack!

84
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,870
Uncle Shalya.

85
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,260
Uncle.

86
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,260
Is that weapon in your hand called
as "delusionist" too?

87
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,560
- Or else, it won't work. 
- No, dear.

88
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,840
This weapon is called "your death".

89
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,560
Grandsire, I hope you remember your
vow.

90
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,170
You must fight the war with all
your power.

91
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,090
You must destroy their entire army
today

92
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,370
and get me to Yudhistir.

93
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,190
I want victory today, Grandsire.

94
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,860
Today.

95
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,930
As long as I'm alive

96
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,730
I won't let you get defeafed,
Duryodhan.

97
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,090
But as long as the Pandavas are
together

98
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,730
your victory is impossible.

99
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,860
Grandsire.

100
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,430
Ask them to form a squared planning.

101
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,060
We don't have time to build anything
now.

102
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,700
Let them get over with their
wreckage.

103
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,530
Arjun.

104
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,790
Ride the chariot towards Duryodhan.

105
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,530
At your command.

106
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,630
Madhav.

107
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,460
Grandsire. That eagle will eat our
army.

108
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,790
Why don't you say something?

109
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,640
What delusion are you in?

110
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,560
Prince Arjun, with much quickness

111
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,490
has destroyed the foremost part our
army's formation, My King.

112
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,490
All five brothers

113
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,060
are at a close proximity to Prince
Duryodhan!

114
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,240
They shall soon be facing Prince
Duryodhan!

115
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,770
What!

116
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,440
But why isn't Grandsire coming up with a
counter attack for protecting my sons, Sanjay?

117
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,260
Grandsire Bhishma!

118
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,560
The Pandavas are smashing through
our army!

119
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,430
If we do not counter them

120
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,380
they shall soon reach my dear lad
Duryodhan!

121
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,330
Why aren't you assuming a better
formation to counter them?

122
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,860
A crocodile always keeps it's mouth
open

123
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,370
until the fish fully enters into its
mouth with confidence!

124
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,590
I was awaiting Grandsire's blessings!

125
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,490
I have it now!

126
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,630
Now I shall duel with Grandsire!

127
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,510
Proceed, Krishna!

128
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,540
The time has come for the crocodile
to shut its jaws!

129
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,810
Untill all five Pandavas are together

130
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,430
we cannot reach Yudishtir!

131
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,430
Now, it is time to separate the
Pandavas!

132
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,390
Bheem, Arjun, Nakul, Sahadev...

133
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
We must stay together at all times!
