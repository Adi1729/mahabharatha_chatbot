1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,380
Is your

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,410
will power your own,
Radheya?

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,320
If you had that kind
of independence

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,460
then why would you have to
bear that crown again?

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,340
I am your wife.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,520
I shall indeed stand by you.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,510
Accepting every decision
of her husband

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,480
is the duty of a wife.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,420
Stop, Vrushali.

10
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,450
Vrushali, I feel as though

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,350
you will never experience

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,350
any joy by living in the palace

13
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,320
and seeing you in pain

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,290
will make my heart
bleed as well.

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,350
I wish to be the reason
of your happiness, Vrushali.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
I do not wish to be
the reason of your sadness.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,520
If living in the palace
will make you unhappy

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,250
then you need not live there.

19
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,480
You have absolutely
no such obligation, Vrushali.

20
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,320
My child is growing
in your womb, Vrushali

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,480
and I am absolutely certain

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,220
that the values you will
impart to it in this hut

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,480
will be more than anything
it will ever get in a palace.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,420
If you like

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,380
then you may live here

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,320
under the care and protection
of my parents.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,360
A person sailing across the
ocean is guided by the Pole Star

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,410
even though it is
far away from him.

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,350
You too will have to
stay away from me

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,290
and guide me to happiness.

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,180
If it is written in my fate

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
then I shall indeed
reach that place someday.

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,380
'Every time I have left my home
wearing this crown'

34
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,220
I have lost something
very precious to me.

35
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,290
I must leave with
the Crown Prince soon

36
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,120
for Indraprastha,
Vrushali.

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,340
I cannot refuse him.

38
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,280
I am indebted to him

39
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,290
but one day, I shall pay off
all his debts and come to you

40
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,260
by freeing myself
of all my struggles

41
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,180
to rest.

42
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,220
Where have they built
the illusory court?

43
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,210
I can only see the woods
all around us.

44
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,210
Be careful,
Dusshasan.

45
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,980
I have heard that Mayasur

46
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,160
has built an even more fantastic
court than that of Lord Indra.

47
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,950
Is Lord Indra's court
this dark?

48
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,010
Lord Indra's court

49
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,150
is illuminated with the prayers
of us mortals, my darlings.

50
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,050
Such dedication to Yudhishthir!

51
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,990
Which being on earth

52
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,080
can illuminate this place?

53
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,150
A swarm of fireflies!

54
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,080
Let's proceed,
my darlings.

55
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
Let's proceed,
uncle.

56
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's

57
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,950
Let's proceed,
my darlings.

58
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,860
Welcome, Crown Prince
Duryodhan of Hastinapur!

59
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,890
All of you are welcome to the
illusory court of Indraprastha!

60
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,860
W-What is this marvellous sight,
brother Duryodhan?!

61
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,920
Be quiet,
foolish Dusshasan!

62
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,050
Your words are like
salt being rubbed

63
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,960
into the raw wounds of my heart.

64
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,960
Be patient, my darling.
Be patient!

65
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,880
All this can be yours

66
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,980
and it shall indeed be so.

67
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,810
I have never accepted

68
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,990
defeat in my life.

69
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,950
Let it be,
uncle.

70
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,010
You made several plans

71
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,980
but none were successful!

72
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,980
I have no faith in you.

73
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,750
You have no faith in me!

74
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,750
What are you saying,
my darling?!

75
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,810
I am telling the truth, uncle.

76
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,890
I want success today...
Today!

77
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
Not in the future.

78
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,810
Henceforth,
I shall come up

79
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,740
with my own plans.

80
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
In order to be successful

81
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,950
one does not need a plan,
Crown Prince Duryodhan!

82
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,750
One needs to take a decision

83
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,790
and in order to take one,
one must rid oneself of fear.

84
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,760
Welcome, Crown Prince Shishupal!

85
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,880
You are welcome to the illusory
court of Indraprastha!

86
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,850
Crown Prince Shishupal

87
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,920
are you questioning
my competence?!

88
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,680
No

89
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I am not

90
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,860
but your beloved
brother Yudhishthir is.

91
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,660
The sons of King Pandu

92
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,950
are questioning your competence.

93
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,750
Do you not know

94
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,760
how many Kings have come here

95
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,890
to Emperor Yudhishthir's...
Oh!

96
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,920
No...

97
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,950
They have come to the
undefeated Emperor Yudhishthir

98
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
to accept his dominance!

99
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,750
In the end

100
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,860
that deceitful
and treacherous cowherd

101
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,760
has made Yudhishthir
the undefeated Emperor

102
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,810
but the 500-year-old
throne of Hastinapur

103
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,780
has not yet been able
to achieve this feat.

104
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
Crown Prince Duryodhan

105
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,720
do you know why?

106
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,650
Because you

107
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,620
are impotent!

108
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,850
Shishupal!

109
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,520
Crown Prince Duryodhan
do you know why?

110
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,490
Because you are impotent!

111
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,590
Shishupal!

112
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,430
Do not resort to verbal abuses,
Crown Prince of Chedi.

113
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,330
The competition begun here
by the Pandavas today

114
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,520
shall indeed end
in the battlefield someday

115
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,560
and then
everyone will know

116
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,550
how competent each person is.

117
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,390
Are you not the King of Anga?

118
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,360
I had seen you at Panchali's
'swayamvar.'

119
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,550
Were you not called the
son of a charioteer

120
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,460
by Panchali?

121
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,460
And you had left the bow
right there at the arena.

122
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,560
Had I been in your place

123
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,360
I would have destroyed
that bow that instant!

124
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,320
But you are foolish!

125
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,360
Besides, nothing more
can be expected of you

126
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,360
King of Anga.

127
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,490
Crown Prince Shishupal

128
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,460
do you engage in verbal abuses
only to digest your food

129
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,360
or has this 'yajna'
left you unhappy as well?

130
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,320
Unhappy?

131
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,430
No.

132
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,350
I am exceedingly unhappy!

133
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,400
Whenever Krishna
succeeds in something

134
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,290
it leaves me deeply agonized!

135
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,530
Was Krishna not instrumental
in this 'yajna' as well?

136
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,400
I shall indeed
render it ineffective!

137
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,200
What kind of a
Rajsuya 'Yajna' is this

138
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,260
where none of the other
Kings are present?

139
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
But
we saw many Kings

140
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,230
and maids enter through
that door, brother Duryodhan.

141
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,260
Even Shishupal
went through it just now.

142
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,160
Where did everyone go?

143
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,190
Look, Prince Dusshasan.

144
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,390
Those maids

145
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,250
vanish the moment they reach a
certain length from the 'yajna.'

146
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,400
Many people must certainly
have gathered here

147
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,320
but because of the illusion
we are unable to see them.

148
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,000
Will you not seek my blessings
brother Shishupal?

149
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,690
In your entire life

150
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,790
I see nothing worth revering,
Krishna.

151
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,800
You are certainly older than me

152
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,690
but inferior in terms of action.

153
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,100
You are certainly older than me

154
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,200
but inferior in terms of action.

155
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,130
Even a 100-year-old
Indian Plum tree

156
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,130
is used only as firewood,
Krishna

157
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,320
and not to construct a house.

158
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,230
You sound like quite
the intellectual, Shishupal

159
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,100
but disrespecting people
elder to oneself

160
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,060
is a misdeed.

161
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,230
I do not fear anyone!

162
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,060
Besides, you had
promised my mother

163
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,130
that you would pardon a 100
misdeeds of mine, Krishna.

164
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,230
Besides, I am keeping a count

165
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,090
of my misdeeds,
Krishna.

166
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,290
Despite knowing

167
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,260
that it is a misdeed, why do
you get such joy from doing it?

168
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,070
What if, Shishupal

169
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
when the time is right

170
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,130
you forget the count
of your misdeeds?

171
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,150
Just because the limit is 100

172
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,160
pushing it to 99

173
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,130
is incorrect,
beloved brother.

174
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,060
So, Crown Prince Shishupal...

175
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,930
The way Vasudev's father

176
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,200
is an uncle to the Pandavas

177
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,970
similarly, is he
not your uncle as well?

178
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,930
Then why do you behave
in such a manner with him?

179
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,050
Oh yes!

180
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,160
I had forgotten

181
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,930
that at the time of your birth

182
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,220
Vasudev Krishna had stripped you
of all your powers.

183
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,930
I had heard of such a thing.

184
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,120
I had four arms

185
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,000
and a third eye when I was born.

186
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,060
I had the opulence of the Gods

187
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,990
but who knows what
that Krishna did

188
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,030
and stripped me
of all my powers.

189
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,130
Two of my arms and
the third eye.

190
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,030
The only enemy
I have in this world

191
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,930
is that wicked Krishna!

192
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,870
And just like me

193
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,900
you are utterly impotent here,
Crown Prince Shishupal.

194
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,870
The truth is, when it comes to
Vasudev Krishna's treachery

195
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,930
no one can
ever win against them.

196
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,900
I am not impotent like you,
Duryodhan.

197
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,090
Krishna was instrumental
in this 'yajna,' was he not?

198
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,900
I will tarnish the sanctity
of this 'yajna' at any cost.

199
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,990
I will let this 'yajna'

200
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,930
not get completed at any cost.

201
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,000
Krishna's plan will fail.
