1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
If I weren't your mother

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,180
how do I know what you like?

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,220
So what if I didn't
give you birth, son?

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,220
Wasn't I the one who raised you?

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,110
No, son!

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,110
Karna!
My son!

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,990
If you didn't give birth to me

8
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,250
who gave me birth,
mother Radha?

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,950
Who gave birth to me?

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,180
Who gave me birth?

11
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Who gave me birth?

12
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,180
We do not know, son.

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,060
We were without a child.

14
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,920
We used to pray to
Goddess Ganga everyday

15
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,060
to bless us with a son.

16
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,980
And one day

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,110
Goddess Ganga
heard our prayers.

18
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,980
In a wicker basket

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,920
you were found by us.

20
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,020
Just like an offering
from the Goddess Ganga.

21
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,890
Whose son am I, father?

22
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,850
I do not know, son.

23
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,990
All the folks of Hastinapur say

24
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,050
that Krishna is an incarnation
of Lord Vishnu.

25
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,890
If he mentioned a name

26
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,860
it must be the truth, son.

27
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
It must be the truth.

28
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,790
This world knows me by the name
Radheya, mother Radha.

29
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,860
Now, which name do I respond to?

30
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,980
Which name do I respond to?

31
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,720
Grant me your leave,
supreme minister.

32
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,760
Forgive me, Krishna.

33
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,850
I gave you the invitation
to bring the peace proposal.

34
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,750
But it became the reason
for such grave insult of you.

35
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,720
It isn't your fault,
supreme minister.

36
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,850
Attempting to avoid
debt, disease and war

37
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,750
is always appropriate

38
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,790
irrespective of its outcome.

39
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,810
I made an attempt.

40
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,850
But as to who shall suffer
because of my failure

41
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
shall be evident soon.

42
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,750
The war is on the horizon.

43
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,720
We must soon
decide the venue for battle

44
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,760
and send a summon to Hastinapur
for battle.

45
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,810
Mother.

46
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,690
Being your guest
was a privilege.

47
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,660
And it has also been
the biggest pleasure of my life.

48
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,650
Grant me your leave, aunt.

49
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,880
Before the war, your sons

50
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,710
shall arrive to seek
your blessings.

51
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,850
My five sons have the privilege
of your protection, Krishna.

52
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,810
So, I do not worry about them.

53
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,620
If you ever feel worried
for someone

54
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
go tell him in person

55
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,550
to chose the side of justice.

56
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,690
Everyone invokes the clouds.
But it is said

57
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,580
that clouds arrive when called
upon by a peacock or a cuckoo.

58
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,580
Farewell!

59
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,680
Farewell!

60
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,550
'You are not the son of
Adirath and mother Radha.'

61
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,780
'You are the son of
Queen Kunti.'

62
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,490
'So what if I didn't
give you birth, son?'

63
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,780
'Wasn't I the one
who raised you?'

64
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,590
'You are the spawn
of the Sun God himself.'

65
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,550
'You are the son of
Queen Kunti.'

66
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,620
'Karna, King of Anga,
is as good as your brother.'

67
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,550
Son?

68
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
'You may think of me
as your mother!'

69
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,420
'Princes who flaunt their
birth status like ornaments!'

70
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,420
'Remember!
In the battlefield'

71
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,510
'everyone shall be faced with
their courage and their lives!'

72
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,490
'And Arjun, if we ever
meet in the battlefield'

73
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,390
'your death shall surely occur
at my hands!'

74
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
My dear!

75
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,390
My dear!

76
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,420
I have heard that
even Krishna has two mothers.

77
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,610
And Krishna respects and loves

78
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,580
both his mothers equally.

79
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,360
Why do you treat this as a blot

80
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,390
on your existence, my dear?

81
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,510
When one craves all his life

82
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
to see the other one suffer

83
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,550
and is then told that the other

84
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,480
is a reflection of his own

85
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,460
and that only when he suffers

86
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,320
even that mirror reflection

87
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,290
shall suffer as well

88
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,320
how can that person
stay calm,...

89
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
Vrushali?

90
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,410
I struggled all my life

91
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,520
to attain respect
worthy of my capability.

92
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,250
I rivaled against
the entire world.

93
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,390
I faced insults worse than death
at every step.

94
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,380
There was no need
for any of it, Vrushali.

95
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,360
There was no need
for any of it.

96
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,280
My dear.
Whom...

97
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,510
Whom are you talking about?

98
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,310
Arjun!

99
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,540
I had beheld Arjun as the
personification of my insults.

100
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,410
I told myself repeatedly

101
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,630
that the day I slay Arjun

102
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,500
the entire world will know
on that day

103
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,570
that even the son of charioteer

104
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,570
can be the best warrior
in the world.

105
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,340
But Arjun...

106
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,480
Arjun is my brother, Vrushali.

107
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,570
He is my younger brother.

108
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,470
Even I am the son of Kunti
like him.

109
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,370
I am not the son of Radha.

110
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,310
How do I deal with
this situation, Vrushali?

111
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,480
I am deeply indebted
to my friend Duryodhan.

112
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,540
How do I think of him as my foe?

113
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,440
I harbour nothing but fury
against Arjun.

114
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,470
How can I offer
my alliance to him?

115
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,500
What trickery is this
by Krishna?

116
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,280
When it was the time to get over
all the agony in my life

117
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,330
he has rendered me unarmed.

118
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,440
Those are my brothers, Vrushali!

119
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,470
Those are my brothers!

120
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,370
How can I wield a weapon
against them, Vrushali?

121
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,240
How can I do it?

122
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,470
How can I wield a weapon against
my brothers, Vrushali?

123
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,270
How can I wield a weapon against

124
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,270
my younger brothers?

125
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,330
My dear!
My dear!

126
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,440
My dear!

127
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,400
Only she can answer
all your questions

128
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,210
who is the root cause
of this situation.

129
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,310
My dear! Please...
Please approach Queen Kunti

130
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,330
and question Queen Kunti

131
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,400
if righteousness means
everything.

132
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,660
'Your Majesty Kunti.'

133
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,730
'I wished to welcome you first
to Hastinapur with this lotus.'

134
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,740
'If you stand quietly this way'

135
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,660
'I shall deduce that you haven't
accepted this flower, O' Queen.'

136
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,500
Any saint, any beseecher

137
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,390
any beggar or a wretched one...

138
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,620
Is anybody there

139
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,630
who can accept alms from me

140
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,530
and do me a favour?

141
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,330
Karna my son.

142
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,360
I am a beggar
and a wretched one too.

143
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,400
Here I am, your mother.

144
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,340
I have come here
hoping for charity.

145
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,500
Would you be able to
donate to her?
