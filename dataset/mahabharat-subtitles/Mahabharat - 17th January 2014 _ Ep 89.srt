1
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Treating women in this manner

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,190
is not correct.

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,130
Their powers ought to be

4
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,090
duly honoured.

5
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,100
Why do you not apologize
to His Highness, Princess?

6
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,290
At times like this, I always
apologize to my father.

7
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,220
I will apologize to him.

8
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,060
I have insulted
father unknowingly.

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,200
I shall indeed apologize to him.

10
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,090
But before that I will prove

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,090
that women do not belong
on the bottom rung.

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,160
But you are all alone, Princess.

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,200
How will you achieve this?

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,200
Who will aid you?

15
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,090
Do you intend to jump
into the water

16
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,930
or are you waiting for it
to jump on you?

17
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,060
Pardon me.

18
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,190
I could not contain
my curiosity.

19
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
You seem like a Princess
from your apparels.

20
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Did you steal those apparels
and jewellery from Kampilya?

21
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,060
I merely wish to know

22
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,160
because the city of Kampilya
and all its wealth

23
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,120
belong to me for I am
its ruler now.

24
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,160
If you have stolen the apparels
and jewellery from Kampilya

25
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,160
then do return them

26
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
otherwise

27
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,960
you shall be punished.

28
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Who are you?

29
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,060
And since when does
Kampilya belong to you?

30
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,020
Me?

31
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,860
I am Krishna Vasudev.

32
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,860
I am about to win
the city of Kampilya

33
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,950
and make all its wealth mine.

34
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,060
Will

35
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,830
you fight by yourself?

36
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,860
How can anyone
possibly fight by oneself?

37
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,870
There must be an opponent
to fight with.

38
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,870
I am about to fight
the King of Kampilya

39
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,920
Drupad
and his entire army.

40
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,990
Let's see who braves my Kaumodaki mace*
*Vishnu's power to destroy materialistic or demonic tendencies (Anarthas) that prevent people from reaching god.

41
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,890
in the battle.

42
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,150
All hail King Drupad!

43
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,180
All hail Mahadev!

44
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,180
All hail Mahadev!

45
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,010
All hail Mahadev!
- March forth!

46
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,240
Drupad

47
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,240
where is your son?

48
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,980
When I heard that you performed
a 'yajna' to have a son

49
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,120
I decided to come here
to bless him.

50
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,040
My son has not been born
to seek your blessings, Drona!

51
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,010
He has been born to slay you!

52
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,150
I know.

53
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,950
In order to slay me

54
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,050
you have asked for a son
from the Gods.

55
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,980
But for how long will this
reciprocal tradition of insult

56
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,950
and revenge be continued by us?

57
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,110
Extinguish the fire burning
within your heart now, Drupad.

58
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,980
Did you get scared,
great warrior Drona?

59
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,010
I have not come here
bearing fear in my heart.

60
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
I have nothing but true love
in my heart

61
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,940
and I wish to bless your son.

62
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,140
After insulting a person,
showering love is easy, Drona.

63
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,110
Had you forgotten
how you were insulted

64
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,050
I would have had faith
in your love.

65
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,040
But you defeated me.

66
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,050
You defeated me!

67
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,050
You took half
the kingdom from me!

68
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,010
If you like, I can return you
your kingdom this instant

69
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,880
because even today,
I want your friendship

70
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,110
and not your kingdom.

71
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,850
It is too late, Drona!

72
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,910
You are a 'Brahmin!'

73
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,050
You can receive charity!

74
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,840
But I am a 'Kshatriya!'

75
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,040
I will never accept charity!

76
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,110
I must now be victorious, Drona!

77
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,970
I must now be victorious!

78
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,110
If I draw my weapon, your
entire army will be destroyed.

79
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,910
But I shall not draw
a weapon on your son.

80
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,040
You did not deem me your friend.

81
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,880
But I still deem you my friend

82
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,920
and your son like mine.

83
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,970
I bless him that may
all his wishes come true.

84
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,050
Dhrishtadyumna

85
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,020
your enemy is
right in front of you!

86
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,090
What are you waiting for?!

87
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,230
Draw your weapon!

88
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
I will not draw
my weapon, Drupad.

89
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,000
Your son has been
born to slay me.

90
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,000
So, allow him

91
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,990
to fulfill the purpose
of his life this instant.

92
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,960
Draw your weapon,
Dhrishtadyumna.

93
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,830
Who are you?!

94
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,890
Who am I?

95
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,970
A fish living in the ocean

96
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,920
cannot possibly know it,
King Drupad.

97
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,870
That is why, do not ask
unnecessary questions.

98
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,860
All you need to know is that I

99
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,800
shall not let you commit
an unrighteous deed.

100
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,990
Unrighteous? Who gave you
the right to decide upon

101
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,820
what is righteous
and what is unrighteous?!

102
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,960
One needs guidance of the soul
to decide upon righteousness.

103
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,790
There is no requirement
of any right, King Drupad.

104
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,730
Had you looked within yourself

105
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,770
you too would have known
what righteousness is.

106
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,700
Greetings, guru Drona.

107
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,660
Greetings, Krishna Vasudev.

108
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,700
Guru Drona has
approached you with amity.

109
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,860
He has even refused
to draw his weapons.

110
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,830
You cannot slay him now,
King Drupad.

111
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,900
Will you protect Drona?

112
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,630
I shall also protect you,
King Drupad

113
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,600
but only if you give up
your unrighteous ways.

114
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,630
Soldiers!

115
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,660
Annihilate that arrogant man!

116
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,760
Do not be foolish, Drupad.

117
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,830
Listen to Krishna Vasudev

118
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,720
and accept my friendship.
- Be quiet, Drona!

119
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,830
Dhrishtadyumna, attack!

120
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,790
If this is what you want,
King Drupad

121
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,760
then do attack.

122
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,730
Attack!

123
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,520
I had told you to give up
your unrighteous ways

124
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,660
and that I would
protect you then.

125
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,660
But you are oblivious
to righteousness, King Drupad.

126
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
Now, I must slay you.

127
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,360
Father..
