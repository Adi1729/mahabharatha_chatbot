1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,690
Indeed, Drona!

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,620
Him!

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,660
Your disciple

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,620
Arjun.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,660
But unfortunately

6
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,660
he died in Varnavrat.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,750
This is what I have heard.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,750
The Pandavas are
my disciples, Drupad.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,720
They have the
capability of escaping

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,590
even the fire of a volcano.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,790
Then how can a small
palace fire hurt them?

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,600
If they are alive then why
do they not show themselves?

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,750
Where are they?

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,820
In order to participate
in Draupadi's 'swayamvar'

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,560
if I have to send the invites

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,790
then where should I send them?

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,820
Fate does not require
an invitation, King Drupad.

18
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,630
Go ahead and conduct
the'swayamvar.'

19
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,560
Hold such a
difficult competition

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,530
that can be won only by
the best archer of the world.

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,590
If it is in the fate
of the Aryan region

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,490
then Arjun will be sent here
by the Almighty himself.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,600
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
- All hail Lord Vrikodar!

24
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,690
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,660
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,620
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

27
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,650
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,460
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,690
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,560
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,600
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,690
All hail Lord Vrikodar!

33
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,420
Apart from that giant man

34
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,550
all of you may devour
the rest of the humans.

35
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,520
Stop...
Stop!

36
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
Hidimb

37
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,590
I beg of you.

38
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,550
Do not sacrifice them.

39
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,530
I beg of you!

40
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,500
Be quiet, Hidimba.
Be quiet!

41
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,460
Ogres

42
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,430
my beloved sister

43
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,560
has fallen in love with
that giant and inferior man.

44
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,520
She has forgotten..

45
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,530
She has forgotten
that she is an ogre!

46
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,460
And the arch-enemies of us ogres

47
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,360
are these humans.

48
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,600
She has forgotten
our Lord Vrikodar!

49
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,290
Hidimba

50
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,430
do not talk like a fool.

51
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,590
By sacrificing these
inferior humans today

52
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,420
we will please
our Lord Vrikodar!

53
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,590
Move forth!

54
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,450
Stop!

55
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,530
King Hidimb, how can they
have a meal before you?

56
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,650
W-Why not?

57
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,500
A-All of us always
dine together.

58
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,620
Sahadev.

59
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,490
Y-Yes.

60
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,650
It is a sin.

61
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,620
Yes, it is an insult
to the King.

62
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,650
Ask our eldest brother
if you like.

63
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,430
He never lies.

64
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,620
Brother, is it not a sin?

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,360
A sin..

66
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,580
No.

67
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,360
It is not a sin..
- It may not be a sin

68
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,550
but it is tradition.

69
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,590
The King ought to
have his meal first.

70
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,550
It is tradition.

71
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,390
And amongst us, you like

72
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,520
brother Bheem most of all.

73
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,450
So, brother Bheem..

74
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,520
No!

75
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,430
Before you engage
in a duel with him

76
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,390
you will have to kill me.

77
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,590
Hidimba, do not worry.

78
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,490
I do not require the
protection of a woman.

79
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,430
Go ahead, King Hidimb.

80
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
No!

81
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,330
No, Hidimb. Listen to me.
Do not kill him!

82
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,550
Listen to me..

83
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,520
Brother Bheem, go on.

84
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,450
The King awaits
to make you his meal.

85
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
Arjun..

86
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,330
Sons, all of you
should also aid Bheem.

87
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,260
Do not worry, mother.

88
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,390
Go ahead, King Hidimb.

89
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I await to become your meal.

90
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,490
Stop!

91
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,360
Only I will fight
this giant man.

92
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,530
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
- All hail Lord Vrikodar!

93
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,290
All hail Lord Vrikodar!
- All hail Lord Vrikodar!

94
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,450
Is Vrikodar
not your name, Bheem?

95
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,350
King Hidimb deems you a God.

96
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,260
Now, go ahead and
offer him some sacrament.

97
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
As you say, brother.

98
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,560
Who is Arjun, Govind?

99
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,490
Arjun?

100
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,350
Thank you!

101
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,420
Arjun

102
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,420
is a Prince of Hastinapur.

103
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,370
His father, King Pandu

104
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,430
had renounced the kingdom

105
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,360
and his elder brother,
King Dhritarashtra

106
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,460
had been appointed
the interim King.

107
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,260
And now, Dhritarashtra's
son Duryodhan also

108
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,420
wants to become King.

109
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,460
But ascension to the throne

110
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,470
should be based on competence

111
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,470
and not on desire.

112
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,520
With regard to this

113
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,230
the throne of Hastinapur
rightfully belongs

114
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,430
to the eldest son of King Pandu

115
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,390
Yudhishthir.

116
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,520
And when Yudhishthir was
declared the Crown Prince

117
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,290
surrounded by anger,
envy and dejection

118
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,360
Duryodhan sent the five brothers
to a palace and burnt them.

119
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,330
This is what people say.

120
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,270
Since then there is no news
of the five brothers.

121
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,230
Maybe because of the animosity
their brothers have with them

122
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,230
they may have decided
to stay hidden.

123
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,420
Who can know?

124
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,460
In other words,
if these rumours are true

125
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,200
then the Pandavas let
injustice happen to them?

126
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,300
They did not even protest

127
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,200
and you call them powerful?

128
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,360
Protest is not a proof
of power, Draupadi.

129
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,290
Powerful are those

130
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,290
who tolerate

131
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,230
and the ones who can do so.

132
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,390
But what about justice, Govind?

133
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,290
How can you deem tolerating
injustice to be a power?

134
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,200
When the heart gets expunged
of protest and anger

135
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,200
tolerance becomes the
strength of righteousness.

136
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,320
From anger stems revenge

137
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,290
but from righteousness..

138
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,130
From righteousness
stems justice, Draupadi.

139
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,290
Draupadi

140
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,390
in your life as well

141
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,300
when you meet

142
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,330
with some form of injustice

143
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,130
before you resort to justice

144
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,220
you must curtail your anger.

145
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
More?

146
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,290
We shall not be
able to eat more.

147
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
We are no longer hungry.

148
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,130
How can you say that we are not
hungry without asking me first?!

149
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,030
You know quite well that I
feel hungrier after a fight!

150
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,300
And this measly amount of fruits
will not suffice me. Bring more.

151
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,090
You need not go.
I shall go bring some.

152
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,170
Do continue eating,
Your Highness.

153
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,290
Your Highness!

154
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,030
King Vrikodar is
getting angry, Nakul.

155
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,120
Apologize!

156
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,060
Pardon me, King Vrikodar.

157
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,230
I beg of you.
Please pardon me.

158
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,120
Fool! You have
committed a crime.

159
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,130
You shall be punished.

160
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,100
You shall be married to an ogre.

161
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,160
Sahadev, Nakul, Arjun
be quiet.

162
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,190
And what is with this
King Vrikodar rant?

163
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,230
Let me eat in peace.

164
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,230
Sure, why not.
Go ahead.

165
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,160
You will now eat in peace
your entire life.

166
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,030
B-But

167
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,190
please do not eat us.

168
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,060
All of us are your brothers,
King Vrikodar.

169
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,060
What are all of you saying?

170
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,120
Brother Bheem

171
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,160
were you not paying attention

172
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,130
when Hidimb's sister
had said all this?

173
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,100
It is the tradition of the ogres

174
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,100
that whoever kills the King

175
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,960
becomes the next King.

176
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,190
In other words, you are now King
of the Ogre region.

177
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,170
Are they telling the truth,
brother Yudhishthir?

178
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,960
Yes, Bheem.

179
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,900
Hidimba did tell us so.

180
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,160
Brother Yudhishthir

181
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,130
will brother Bheem have to
marry an ogre now?

182
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,930
Indeed, brother Arjun.

183
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,160
Sahadev, did you not
have any premonition?

184
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,990
This is an auspicious sign
and I hear jubilation.

185
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,970
And I see brother Bheem
being dressed like ogres.

186
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,190
Could you not
tell me this before?

187
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,120
When Hidimba said

188
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,000
that she would show us
the way out of here

189
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,930
then why did all of you
bring me here?

190
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,120
That is because, brother Bheem

191
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,130
if you had left this forest

192
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,990
then Hidimba's heart
would have been broken.

193
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,020
What do you mean?

194
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,060
The Lord has ordered

195
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,030
you to get married
tomorrow at dawn

196
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,090
to Princess Hidimha.
