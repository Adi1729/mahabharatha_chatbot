1
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,410
Nakul, hold on to its string!

2
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,450
How did you come up with the
idea of making kites, Govind?

3
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,610
Upon observing human beings.

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,540
The hearts of human beings
also keep soaring like kites

5
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,570
in the winds of desire.

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,350
If the string of control
is lost or cut

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,380
the heart

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,580
gets bruised and broken
in the harsh winds of desire.

9
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,570
It goes insane.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,410
Look at Nakul's kite over there!

11
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,340
Sometimes human beings

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,550
lose control over themselves
because of other people.

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,410
Govind!

14
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,480
Your hand is bleeding!

15
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,440
Till the string keeps
the kite in control

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,540
it does not hurt oneself

17
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,310
but when the kite
starts pulling the string

18
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,450
one ends up cutting one's hand.

19
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,370
Sometimes

20
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,280
the actions of others

21
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,350
leave the heart frazzled

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
and one is on the verge
of losing control

23
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,250
but at times like these,
staying composed

24
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,350
and keeping
one's heart under control

25
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,350
becomes quite essential.

26
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,380
Is something like this
going to happen to us, Govind?

27
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,420
Can you not see the future?

28
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,450
No, friend.

29
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,280
I had told you

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,370
that I can observe
the temperament of a person

31
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,280
and estimate his future actions.

32
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,280
However

33
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,370
after seeing the success
of the Pandavas

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,280
the sons of Dhritarashtra must
certainly be up to something

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,410
and at a time like this

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,410
if you know what is
most precious to you

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,270
and safeguard it

38
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,250
you will indeed see the ray of
joy in the darkness of sorrow.

39
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,320
Will you not
stand by us, Govind?

40
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,250
I must leave to protect Dwaraka.

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,410
I have got the news
that King Shalv

42
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,410
has left with his army
and is headed towards Dwaraka

43
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,280
to attack it

44
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,140
but I am

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
always with you.

46
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,210
The string of control
that you had lost

47
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,280
must once again
be in your hands, friend.

48
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,310
Do not lose heart.

49
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,250
I reside in the hearts
of all of you.

50
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,210
If you lose heart

51
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,180
then your Govind

52
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,280
your Krishna
will be lost as well.

53
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,080
The Pandavas!

54
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,070
Three.

55
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,240
All hail His Highness!

56
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,170
Minister Vidur
seeks permission to enter.

57
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,010
Allow him in.

58
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,240
Welcome!

59
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,180
Welcome, my darling
younger brother Vidur!

60
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,180
Greetings.

61
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,050
Greetings,
brother Dhritarashtra.

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,980
Your heart will soar
with joy today

63
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,980
when I give you
this piece of news.

64
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,080
I am all ears,
brother.

65
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,080
What happened in the court
of the sons of Pandu

66
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,010
between Duryodhan and them

67
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,210
and how the daughter of Drupad
had to interfere

68
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,070
in the matters of state

69
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,140
was not at all correct

70
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
for which both Duryodhan
and I are very sorry.

71
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,080
That is why, inviting Draupadi
to Hastinapur and welcoming her

72
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,980
is what I suggest.

73
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,010
Besides

74
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,050
after Draupadi's marriage

75
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,100
she was not

76
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,210
received warmly by us, Vidur.

77
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,070
That is why, I have
taken the decision, Vidur

78
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,180
that by burying the hatchet

79
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,920
the Pandavas and Draupadi will
be invited to Hastinapur by us.

80
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,920
Draupadi must get the much
deserved respect and welcome

81
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,040
and we will ensure
that she gets it, Vidur.

82
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,050
The great Guru Drona
and his son Ashwatthama

83
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,120
will also be cordially
invited to Hastinapur.

84
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,890
The sons of Pandu and Draupadi
will be invited to Hastinapur

85
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,010
personally by you,
Vidur.

86
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,880
But sister-in-law is not
present here, brother.

87
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
What do you mean?

88
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,950
It has been
my experience, brother

89
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,040
that while delivering a news

90
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,850
whenever sister-in-law
is present with you

91
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,850
that news always brings joy.

92
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,970
Minister!

93
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,810
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,040
Will the Pandavas

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,070
be a part of a friendly duel
in this gathering?

96
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,970
No, uncle.

97
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,010
Duels of all sorts
require weapons

98
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,850
and you are

99
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,810
well aware of the natures
of brother Bheem and me.

100
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,810
If there are weapons involved...

101
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,870
No one will use
any weapon, Duryodhan!

102
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,780
That is an order!

103
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,010
The sons of Pandu will be
welcomed warmly by you

104
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,840
and you better not forget that!

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,980
Vidur

106
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,840
along with the knowledge
of the 'shastras' and weapons

107
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,810
a game of dice is also
a part of us 'Kshatriyas.'

108
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,750
That is why, along with
strength and knowledge

109
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,780
it is essential for a King

110
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,750
to have control over
his fortune as well.

111
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,780
And fortune can be tested

112
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,750
with gambling,
can it not?

113
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,010
That is why,
my son Duryodhan

114
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,810
will organize a game of dice.

115
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,720
Let us see

116
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,940
how much control
one has over one's fortune.

117
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
Let us see

118
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,970
how much control
one has over one's fortune.

119
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,770
Go on

120
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,800
and send them the invite.

121
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,830
As you say,
Your Highness.

122
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,800
Uncle, go ahead and play.

123
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,740
Here goes.

124
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,830
Go on...
Twelve.

125
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,870
Look!
I won.

126
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,680
But Your Highness,
you turned the die yourself.

127
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,840
So what?

128
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,870
If we can roll them
with our hands

129
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,830
then why can we not turn them?

130
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,780
Once you roll the dice,
you cannot turn them.

131
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,770
You do not know
how to play this.

132
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,840
You may go.

133
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,670
I will play with My Lord.

134
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,640
My Lord.

135
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,830
My Lord...

136
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,700
Prince Arjun.

137
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,810
What happened,
Subhadra?

138
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,640
Please play 'chausar' with me.

139
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,780
This is the least you can do
for your wife who is with child.

140
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,660
Do you know,
Subhadra?

141
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,730
The actions of a mother

142
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,680
become the values
of the unborn child.

143
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,680
Do you wish to give my child the
values of the game of 'chausar?'

144
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
My child ought to

145
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,640
learn the values
of love and warfare

146
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
and not those
of gambling and drinking.

147
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,700
You will not be able to
teach him the value of love.

148
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,640
That is because,
you do not know it yourself.

149
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
You may teach him
warfare instead.

150
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,730
I hope, you will
not fall asleep.

151
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,640
If it is interesting
then I will not.

152
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,530
A labyrinth of this nature
either has five, seven

153
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,600
or nine circles

154
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
and each circle has a specialty

155
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,470
that it can be navigated
only in a particular way.

156
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,510
This is a labyrinth
of seven circles.

157
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,740
This is how a warrior navigates
through the seven circles

158
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,630
and enters the middle
of the labyrinth.

159
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,700
The warrior must navigate
through the seven circles again

160
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,630
to come out of the labyrinth.

161
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,480
A different kind of strategy
is used for this.

162
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,600
I hope, you are
listening, Subhadra.

163
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,640
Subhadra...

164
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,440
She fell asleep.

165
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,670
I knew that she would.

166
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,430
She heard how to
navigate into a labyrinth

167
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,570
but

168
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,480
failed to hear the strategy
to come out of it.

169
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
She fell asleep before that.

170
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,440
Greetings, Prince.

171
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,600
Minister Vidur of Hastinapur
is here.

172
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,470
His Highness has called you
to the court at once.

173
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,470
Uncle!

174
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,470
What brings uncle here
without informing us earlier?

175
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,440
'The fishes shown in this scene'

176
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,380
'were generated
using computer graphics.'

177
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,500
May Emperor Yudhishthir
have undying glory.

178
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,380
May Empress Draupadi
have eternal happiness.

179
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,530
Your Highness,
on behalf of Hastinapur

180
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,530
I have brought these presents.

181
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,330
For this gesture of goodwill
by Hastinapur

182
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,430
a grand temple will be built
in its honour, Minister

183
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,570
because uncle Dhritarashtra
is revered by all of us.

184
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,370
Your Highness,
Hastinapur is organizing

185
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,380
a humble ceremony
to honour you.

186
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,310
It is being held to honour
especially Empress Draupadi.

187
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,300
I have approached you
and Empress Draupadi

188
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,340
to invite both of you
to that ceremony personally.

189
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,270
Various events will be held
there for your entertainment

190
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,270
and at the end of the ceremony

191
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,400
Crown Prince Duryodhan

192
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,330
will

193
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,360
play a game of dice with you.

194
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,380
Before one accepts
such an invitation

195
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,430
the ministers of the court

196
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,480
and the experienced elders

197
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,440
are always consulted with

198
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,330
Minister.

199
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,170
Certainly.

200
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,370
You may certainly
consult with them

201
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,330
Prince Arjun.

202
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,240
What do you suggest,
uncle?

203
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,200
Should we accept
this invitation?

204
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
My suggestion!

205
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,230
Soldier!

206
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,310
Leave!

207
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,370
Greetings, uncle!

208
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,210
Bless you!

209
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,330
When a hunter sprinkles
grains on the ground

210
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,270
one must understand
at once, dear

211
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,330
that the hunter has set a trap.

212
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,270
Under no circumstance should
this invitation be accepted.

213
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,210
Under the garb of a ceremony,
that Shakuni

214
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
must certainly be weaving
a web of treachery.
