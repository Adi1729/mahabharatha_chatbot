1
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,120
Enter into a duel

2
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,120
or accept defeat!
- Duryodhan, defeat...

3
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,110
Calm down!

4
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,050
Lord!

5
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,150
All the princes would return
to Hastinapur tomorrow.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
You have to arrange
for a celebration.

7
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,110
Celebrate about what?

8
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,080
Gandhari, only victory
can be celebrated.

9
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,990
Not failure.

10
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
And today, I have been defeated.

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,990
Defeated!

12
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,880
But lord, the princes of
Hastinapur have been victorious.

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,910
The subjects always
like celebrations.

14
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,050
But when my son returns

15
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,960
on hearing praises on the
paths of Hastinapur

16
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,850
what would be his plight,
Gandhari?

17
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,920
When the subjects sing praises
about Pandu's sons

18
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,820
how would my Duryodhan
tolerate it?

19
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,080
I...

20
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,950
I am blind.
But my son is not.

21
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,080
In the lamps lighted on the
doorsteps of the subjects

22
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,890
he would see all his desires
on fire, Gandhari.

23
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,890
All the desires.

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,790
If one dislikes the image
seen in the mirror

25
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,950
then the mirror isn't at fault.

26
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Instead, the appearance
is at fault.

27
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,780
The subjects are like
the mirror.

28
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,850
Whatever the subjects
portray is the truth.

29
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,820
The truth about us and
Duryodhan is that

30
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,790
as the heir to the throne

31
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
only Yuddhistir has
the authority.

32
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,820
How would he agree to it?

33
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,920
How would he?

34
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,910
How would my Duryodhan sacrifice

35
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,910
his dream to become the king?

36
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,790
How would he bow his head
before Yuddhistir?

37
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,790
How would he?

38
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,850
Yuddhistir, let's
decide right now

39
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,720
between us.

40
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,750
Who is the strongest?
Who is destined to win?

41
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,880
I consider a duel with you
as a defeat, Duryodhan.

42
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,860
A fight between the princes
of the Kuru dynasty

43
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,890
isn't appropriate.

44
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,860
When two logs of
wood are rubbed

45
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,890
it results in fire.

46
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,680
And all the woods

47
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,850
burn down to ashes.

48
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,820
I don't need a preaching.
I need a result.

49
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,780
The throne of Hastinapur
belongs to me.

50
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,910
You must either take an oath

51
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,880
that you sacrifice the
throne of Hastinapur

52
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,850
or fight a duel.

53
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,620
I take an oath...
- Brother!

54
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,760
Do not take an oath which
would hurt our father's soul.

55
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,660
Duryodhan, I take an oath.

56
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,750
Whatever king Dhrithrashtra
decides

57
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,650
I will agree with it.

58
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,850
To make a promise
other than this

59
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,850
would be like deceiving the
subjects of the Kuru dynasty.

60
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,590
And the decision of
king Dhrithrashtra is

61
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,810
that his son

62
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,820
be coronated on the throne
of Hastinapur.

63
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,560
And that will surely happen.

64
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,450
'Hastinapur.'

65
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,250
'Panchaal.'

66
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,250
'Dhrupad will himself'

67
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,320
'perform the rituals
towards Ashwathama.'

68
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,310
'Dhrupad will himself'

69
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,310
'coronate Ashwathama
on the throne.'

70
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,450
'I return the half of the
divided kingdom to you.'

71
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,150
'You have no son
of your own, anyway.'

72
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,320
Father...
- Everything is ruined.

73
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,190
The way in which age old trees
get destroyed in a forest fire...

74
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,190
In the same way,
an ancient kingdom...

75
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,250
The popularity of which
could embarrass even the Gods.

76
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,290
The grand valour
of the ancestors...

77
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,380
Everything is ruined...

78
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,180
Everything is ruined!

79
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,180
If there is a forest fire

80
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,150
it only makes the land
more fertile, father.

81
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,220
More trees grow on
the same land.

82
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,250
I am sure there would
come a time again

83
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,150
when Panchaal's flag of victory

84
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,220
will be hoisted on the
palace of Hastinapur.

85
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,120
Who will bring such a time?

86
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,250
Who will bring such times?!

87
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,090
Who will bring such times?!
Would you?!

88
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,150
You are a helpless woman.

89
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,190
Would you be fighting a war
against those ace warriors?

90
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,350
You were defeated in
the very first attack!

91
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,110
You haven't witnessed the
potentials of Pandu's sons.

92
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,150
Haven't you heard the
sound of Arjun's bow string?

93
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,120
I felt like

94
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,280
it was Lord Indra's weapon.

95
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,090
They are undefeatable.

96
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,310
Would you raise your
weapons before them?

97
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,160
Would you point your
weapons at them?!

98
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,190
Yes, father.

99
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,120
Time defeats the greatest
of warriors.

100
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,150
But time cannot defeat me.

101
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,090
Father, I cannot die

102
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,090
until I kill Bhishma.

103
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,020
You know that very well.

104
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,050
These talks are futile,
Shikandini.

105
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,250
I do not agree that you have
been blessed by Lord Shiva!

106
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,250
I was a fool

107
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,090
to consider you as a
potential resource.

108
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,220
Shikandini, one cannot apply
turmeric on silver ornaments

109
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
and turn them into gold.

110
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,150
You are useless to me.

111
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Go, Shikandini!

112
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,950
You are useless to me.

113
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,160
Only a perfect son

114
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,980
is greater than a mighty
and well-equipped army.

115
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
Until I do not attain a son

116
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,120
I will consider myself
childless!

117
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,160
I need a son

118
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,960
who can behead Drona.

119
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,920
Who can sit on the throne of
Hastinapur

120
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,980
and rule.

121
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
A competition?

122
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,110
What kind of competition,
father?

123
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,210
Sire Bhishma and

124
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,080
the chief minister termed
it as a competition.

125
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,210
We do not agree to it.

126
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,080
Dushasan is right, father.

127
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,050
Tomorrow, you have to
announce at the royal court

128
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,180
that your son will be your heir.

129
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,050
How would I, son?

130
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,150
Show me a way.
How would I?

131
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,050
You can give a mere reason.

132
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,180
Even if your prove that Dhrupad
or Drona cheated you

133
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,210
I will immediately declare
you as my heir, son.

134
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,170
What are you saying, father?

135
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,210
What is the need to
look for a solution?

136
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,080
You are the king!

137
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,040
When the sun rises, the moon
and the stars have to fade.

138
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,210
No one has the authority to
speak before the king.

139
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,970
Son, a king is independent.

140
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,010
He cannot be partial, though.

141
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,910
I cannot decide as I wish, son.

142
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,010
When you have no doubts over the
superiority of the Pandavas'

143
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,050
how can I make the
subjects doubt over it?

144
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,140
This means, you will announce
Yuddhistir as the King tomorrow.

145
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,010
Father, I believed you.

146
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,040
I wouldn't agree to it
at any cost.

147
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,080
At court, if you declare
Yuddhistir as the King

148
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,040
then I would revolt.
- No! Don't you do that, son.

149
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,110
Don't do that.

150
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,910
If you revolt, then...
- Then?

151
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,910
You would appoint an
army against me.

152
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
I know that.

153
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,140
The king who doesn't punish
the one who revolts

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,110
he has to renounce his kingdom.

155
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,950
Father.

156
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,980
Would you declare a war
against your sons?

157
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,850
Charcoal is born out of fire.

158
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,010
But even then, if charcoal
falls into fire

159
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,850
it's the duty of the fire

160
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,940
to burn it into ashes.

161
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,080
'Hail the sons of Pandu!
- Hail!'

162
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,810
'Hail the sons of Pandu!
- Hail!'

163
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,870
'Hail the sons of Pandu!
- Hail!'

164
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,810
Father, you can continue
with your rightful duties.

165
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,820
The chance is standing
right in your courtyard!

166
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,880
But you must mark my words.

167
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,010
At court, if you declare
Yuddhistir as the King

168
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,810
I will destroy the honour and
respect of Hastinapur. - No!

169
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,910
That's a promise.
- No...

170
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,780
Duryodhan!

171
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,780
Duryodhan...

172
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,840
Duryodhan!

173
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,940
Duryodhan.

174
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,770
Greetings, King.

175
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,810
We have been victorious,
thanks to your blessings.

176
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,850
We have fulfilled our duty
towards our teacher.

177
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,780
Bless you.

178
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,770
Your deed must have pleased

179
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,870
your teacher, Drona.
Am I right?

180
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Greetings, your highness.
- Bless you.

181
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,850
Congratulations on winning
the competition.
