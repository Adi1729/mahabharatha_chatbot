1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,540
Why does righteousness
get defeated, brother?

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,470
And why does
unrighteousness win?

3
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,300
Getting something is not winning

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,340
and losing something
is not being defeated.

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,310
It is merely the impact
of time, Subhadra.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,360
Change is ingrained
in its nature.

7
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,340
Uncle

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,530
the fortunes have changed.

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,500
The flag of the Pandavas

10
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,270
has been lowered!

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,300
The fear in my heart

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,360
has gone away

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,530
forever.

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,270
No, my darling!
No!

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,310
Just because the reason
of your fear is going away

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,410
it does not imply that your
fear is going away as well.

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,310
When the reason of your fear
gets annihilated

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,460
only then does

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,270
the fear in your heart

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,200
truly go away.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,500
That is why,
spies will follow the Pandavas

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,460
at my order.

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,200
Until the five Pandavas

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,500
are alive

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,270
the fear in your heart

26
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,340
is alive as well.

27
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,170
If something makes man fearful

28
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,370
then he has been defeated.

29
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,140
And despite losing something,
the person

30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,360
who remains calm and composed

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,340
is truly victorious.

32
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,330
Times will change,
Subhadra.

33
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,210
Unrighteous people will
indeed be punished

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,230
and the flag of righteousness
will fly once again.

35
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,330
This is not the departure
of defeated soldiers

36
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,370
but the beginning of the journey
of victory of the Pandavas.

37
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,240
The struggles in these 13 years

38
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,330
will indeed
lead them to victory.

39
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,170
'A few days later.'

40
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,230
Panchali,
give me that vessel.

41
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,030
Let me go bring some water.

42
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,200
There must indeed
be a pool nearby.

43
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,110
Why is My Lord Nakul

44
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,000
not back yet?

45
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Let me go check.

46
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,160
I shall come with you,
brother.

47
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,970
Nakul!

48
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,160
Brother Nakul!

49
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,040
Brother Nakul!
- Nakul!

50
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,940
Brother Nakul!
- Nakul!

51
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,060
Brother Nakul!
Brother Bheem!

52
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,070
Brother Nakul...
Brother Nakul!

53
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,040
Nakul...

54
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,900
Brother Bheem,
brother Nakul is not breathing.

55
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,130
Get up,
brother Nakul.

56
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,930
Sahadev...
Sahadev!

57
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,870
Sahadev!

58
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,890
Brother Yudhishthir

59
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,030
something terrible
must have befallen them.

60
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,940
Let me go check.

61
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,060
Stay here and protect Panchali.

62
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,100
The three of us could
go together, My Lord.

63
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,890
No, Panchali.

64
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,070
We do not know what kind
of trouble they ran into.

65
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,070
You must stay here.

66
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,800
Brother Bheem!

67
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,840
Nakul, Sahadev!

68
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,030
Brother Bheem!

69
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,030
Sahadev!

70
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,770
Brother Bheem!

71
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,030
They do not seem to be hurt.

72
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,840
And neither do they have
the symptoms of being poisoned.

73
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,800
My brothers

74
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,910
must certainly have been killed

75
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,910
by an illusory being.

76
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,800
I know

77
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,900
that you can hear me.

78
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,830
No matter who you are

79
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,740
you must bring
my brothers back to life

80
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,900
otherwise I shall
dry this pool up!

81
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,800
I, son of Pandu, Arjun

82
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,870
warn you--

83
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,700
No matter who you are...

84
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,930
A Yaksh,* demon
*Nature-spirits, usually benevolent, who are caretakers of the natural treasures hidden in the earth and tree roots.

85
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,900
eunuch, ghoul

86
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,800
an illusory being or ogre...

87
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,910
You must bring
my brothers back to life.

88
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,870
Panchali, had it
been a human being

89
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,910
he could not have held Bheem
and Arjun up for this long.

90
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,860
I must go.

91
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,900
I hope you will be able to use
this spear to protect yourself.

92
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,870
Let me come with you,
My Lord.

93
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,700
No, Panchali.

94
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,830
I do not know
what trouble awaits there.

95
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,800
If a trouble befalls
the five of you, My Lord

96
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,730
then it would be the same
for me as well.

97
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,830
Panchali

98
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,900
in the torch of justice
enkindled by Vasudev

99
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,770
you are the fire.

100
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,860
Before justice
reigns supreme again

101
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,800
your life cannot be
extinguished.

102
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,700
If none of us brothers
return alive

103
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,860
then you must go to Dwaraka.

104
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,670
Vasudev will illuminate
the path ahead.

105
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,760
Bheem...
Bheem!

106
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,700
Bheem!

107
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,730
Nakul...
Nakul!

108
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,830
Sahadev...
Sahadev.

109
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,670
Arjun...
Arjun!

110
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,100
What is this illusion?

111
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,070
Who are you

112
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
to have killed my brothers
for no reason?

113
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,030
Please show yourself.

114
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,060
Until I know who I am

115
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,990
fighting with and why

116
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,030
I will not take to arms.

117
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,100
I do not fear you.

118
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,140
I do not wish to insult you
unintentionally.

119
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,990
Please show yourself.

120
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,000
I am the King of the Yakshas

121
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,060
the master of this pool!

122
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,100
No human being has the right

123
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,890
to take water from this pool!

124
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,900
Yet your brother Nakul

125
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,840
tried to take water
from this pool

126
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,870
though he had no right!

127
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,090
That is why

128
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,940
I slayed him!

129
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,970
Son of Pandu

130
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,900
your brothers

131
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,800
challenged me to a fight
out of vanity!

132
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,000
That is why,
I taught the four of them

133
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,000
a lesson of my competence

134
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,090
and asserted my right

135
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,930
by slaying them.

136
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
Neither did you
create this water

137
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,930
nor the place from where
water can be taken.

138
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,870
Then how can you have the right
to this place, Yaksha King?

139
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,800
Taking water is no crime,
King of the Yakshas.

140
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,000
Then how could you
punish my brothers so?

141
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,060
Justice and righteousness

142
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,030
dictate that
my brothers must be

143
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,900
brought back to life.

144
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Impossible!

145
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,840
However, by answering
my questions

146
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,990
if you are able to
make me contented

147
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,070
then I shall bring one of
your brothers back to life.

148
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,770
After the death of
the four brothers of mine

149
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,990
it is not possible for me
to live any longer, Yaksha King.

150
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,840
However, I wish to keep
one of my brothers alive.

151
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,840
That is why,
I will use my intelligence

152
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,870
to try my best
and make you contented.

153
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,870
Ask the questions,
King of the Yakshas.

154
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,730
Tell me what life

155
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,840
and death are?

156
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,800
Yaksha King, according
to the Rig Veda...

157
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,740
In the heart of
the supreme element

158
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,740
there was the desire to generate
the creation in the beginning.

159
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,790
The rays of that desire
spread all around

160
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,800
and thus were formed
the directions.

161
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,940
The desire of the Almighty led
to the genesis of the creation.

162
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,830
Three realms,
three qualities

163
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,930
and three dimensions of time
were created.

164
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,990
Many beings and elements

165
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,730
were born in the heart
of the Almighty.

166
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,790
Every being and element
is the Almighty himself, sire.

167
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,790
In other words

168
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,870
the Almighty is life.

169
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
If the heart of a person
understands this

170
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,790
then he can never be angry with
or envious of someone.

171
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,960
He walks on the path
of righteousness

172
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,830
and respects justice.

173
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,760
This is the essence of life.

174
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,840
And what is death,
Yudhishthir?

175
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,660
Tell me.

176
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,700
Because of love

177
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,740
selfishness and anger man
gets connected to another.

178
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,730
This tie is called attachment.

179
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,840
Because of attachment,
man deems his body to be life

180
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,890
while the disintegration of
the body is deemed to be death.

181
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,670
However, the entire world was
born in the Almighty's heart

182
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,860
and only in the heart
of the Almighty can it end.

183
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,700
Two people travelling
on the same path

184
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,640
can walk with each other
for a while

185
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,790
but then they get separated.

186
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,700
At that moment,
they feel

187
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,670
that the other person
has met with death

188
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,670
but in reality,
both the travellers

189
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,790
are walking down the same path.

190
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,770
Similarly,
what we call death

191
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,860
is merely the distance that
arises between two human beings.

192
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,670
Until the world exists

193
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,670
no being can truly disintegrate.

194
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,700
Then how can one
meet with one's death?

195
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,630
In other words,
King of the Yakshas

196
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,600
the Almighty is the world

197
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,820
and the world is life.

198
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,860
Death is merely a delusion

199
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,830
and an illusion.

200
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,640
Death is merely a delusion

201
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,380
and an illusion.

202
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,440
Wonderful,
dear Yudhishthir!

203
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,540
You have given satisfactory
answers to my questions.

204
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,590
That is why,
I shall keep my word

205
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,580
and bring one of your brothers

206
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,380
back to life.

207
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,610
Go ahead and ask

208
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,580
for the life of the strongest
person in this world!

209
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,380
If Bheem is alive

210
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,440
no enemy will ever be
able to challenge you.

211
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,580
The mighty Lord Hanuman
will protect your kingdom!

212
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,370
No, Yaksha King.

213
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,450
The greatest enemy of a person

214
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,350
is the grief housed
within his heart.

215
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,380
If three of my brothers are dead

216
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,450
then how will Bheem
be able to protect me

217
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,420
from that enemy called grief?

218
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,380
The truth is,
the grief within Bheem

219
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,320
will defeat him
and leave him weak.

220
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,390
Then ask for Arjun's life.

221
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,320
If the greatest archer
of the world will be alive

222
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,420
then the entire world
will benefit from it!

223
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,310
I know Arjun,
King of the Yakshas.

224
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,380
When he will find out

225
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,280
that the reason of his life

226
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,290
is the death of the
three brothers of his

227
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,290
his courage will wither

228
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,290
strength will leave his body

229
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,440
and his Gandiva will slip
from his hands forever.

230
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,250
If I ask for the life
of either Bheem or Arjun

231
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,350
then my mother will
also be unhappy.

232
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,510
Your mother will be unhappy
to have two of her sons alive!

233
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,410
What kind of an argument
is that, Yudhishthir?!

234
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,410
One of the sons of my
mother is alive, Yaksha King.

235
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,480
I am alive.

236
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,510
Now, the second wife
of King Pandu also has the right

237
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,280
to have one
of her sons to be alive.

238
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,220
My mother Kunti would want this

239
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,450
and I wish for the same as well.

240
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,410
That is why,
King of the Yakshas

241
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,250
if you wish to bring
one of my brothers back to life

242
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,320
then give my brother Nakul
the boon of life.

243
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,210
Wonderful,
dear Yudhishthir!

244
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,210
I am pleased.

245
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,440
I am Dharma Raj.

246
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,440
I had gifted Kunti and Pandu

247
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,220
with you as my blessing.

248
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,340
From that perspective,
I am your biological father

249
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,320
and I am proud
of my biological son.

250
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,420
I shall bring all your brothers

251
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
back to life.
