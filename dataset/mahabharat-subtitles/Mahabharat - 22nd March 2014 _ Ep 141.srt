1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,370
I will not let this 'yajna'

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,430
get completed at any cost.

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,300
Krishna's plan will fail.

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,240
And if you are able to do that,
Crown Prince Shishupal

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,170
then I shall use my mace
to protect you.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I give you my word.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,370
Weak and foolish people like you

8
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,240
are of no use to me,
Duryodhan.

9
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,300
I can be slain
only by the person

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,140
who had taken my additional arms

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,210
and third eye from me.

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,110
In other words,
Krishna.

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,240
But he will not kill me

14
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,170
because my mother
had made him promise

15
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,170
that he will pardon
100 misdeeds of mine.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,310
Nevertheless, knowing that
you are on my side

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,110
has left me exceedingly pleased.

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,240
'The fishes shown in this scene'

19
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,210
'have been generated
using computer graphics.'

20
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,130
The ritual is now complete.

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,300
You may be seated
on the throne now

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,070
and then distribute
the offertory to the guests.

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,270
After you are done with it

24
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,360
we will proceed
to the next phase

25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,170
in which four
representative Kings

26
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,270
will build a canopy
on your throne.

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,310
Only then will you be declared
the supreme Emperor.

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,130
Bless you!

29
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,310
Revered guests

30
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,170
our mother had taken the oath

31
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,270
that only after the city
of her sons becomes independent

32
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,280
will she enter Indraprastha.

33
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
Hence, we were compelled

34
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,100
to engage in labour
and demonstrate our valour.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,070
Because of the teachings

36
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,010
of our revered grandsire Bhishma

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,080
we have been successful
in this endeavour.

38
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,100
Only after seeking the blessings
of both these people

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,010
will I have the right
to be seated on the throne.

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,230
I welcome mother and grandsire
to this gathering!

41
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,200
All hail His Excellency Bhishma!

42
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,040
All hail His Excellency Bhishma!

43
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,010
All hail Queen Mother Kunti!

44
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,940
All hail Queen Mother Kunti!

45
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,170
All hail His Excellency Bhishma!

46
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,170
May you live long!

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Greetings, grandsire.

48
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,130
Greetings, grandsire.

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,030
Bless you all!

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,140
Seeing this city of yours
has made me very proud.

51
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,070
Give your mother Kunti
a grand welcome

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,170
and have her seated at
the highest place in the court.

53
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,040
I have been a witness
to her struggles.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,970
All of you

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,100
are reaping the rewards
of her struggles.

56
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Bless you!

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,030
Get up,
Yudhishthir.

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,010
Apart from the Almighty

59
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,970
a King does not prostrate
before anyone else.

60
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,010
If you do not allow me
to break this tradition, mother

61
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,940
then I will not be able
to sit on the throne.

62
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Go on,
son.

63
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,000
Be seated on your throne

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,940
and grace this court.

65
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,770
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!

66
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,000
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!

67
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,070
All hail Empress Draupadi!

68
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,870
All hail Empress Draupadi!

69
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,000
The 'yajna' is almost complete,
Crown Prince Shishupal

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,910
but you have
not yet tarnished it.

71
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,940
A few rituals are
yet to be completed

72
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Crown Prince Duryodhan.

73
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,870
First, Yudhishthir
will sit on the throne

74
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,810
then he will be crowned

75
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,740
and finally,
he will distribute

76
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,800
the offertory to the sages
and the Kings.

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,940
However, if the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,030
is interrupted before he does so

79
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,740
it will be deemed unsuccessful,
Crown Prince Duryodhan.

80
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,740
And there are bound to be

81
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,000
a few lapses
in such a grand ceremony.

82
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,900
I am looking for that lapse,
Crown Prince.

83
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,870
But where is the throne?

84
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,930
Despite being an Emperor

85
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,930
how can he sit on the ground?!

86
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,900
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!

87
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,840
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!

88
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,900
All hail Empress Draupadi!

89
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,670
All hail Empress Draupadi!

90
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,840
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!

91
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,810
All hail the supreme
Emperor Yudhishthir!

92
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
All hail Empress Draupadi!

93
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,640
All hail Empress Draupadi!

94
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Dear Yudhishthir

95
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,730
the way Surya Dev

96
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,710
graces the entire sky

97
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,710
by spreading his brilliant rays

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,780
and dispels the fear
of darkness in men

99
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,900
similarly

100
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,740
the Kings, who have
accepted your status

101
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,640
as the supreme Emperor

102
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,640
need to be sprinkled
with water on their heads

103
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,640
by you to rid them of fear.

104
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,630
This is the duty
of a supreme Emperor.

105
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
As you say,
Sage Vyas-

106
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,680
But dear,
Surya Dev himself

107
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,770
is under the authority

108
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,770
of Lord Vishnu in the heavens.

109
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,710
A supreme King

110
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,600
accepting the authority
of another person

111
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,770
is deemed correct
by the 'shastras.'

112
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,600
A person

113
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,640
who can guide
the Emperor to righteousness.

114
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,800
Upon whose advice

115
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,570
the supreme Emperor

116
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,840
would engage in a battle
or call a truce.

117
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,610
Seeking the blessings
of such a person

118
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,770
and giving him the offertory
first is a tradition.

119
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,830
This tradition

120
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,730
is also called 'pudovas'
or 'prathamarghya.'

121
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Who will you offer
the 'pudovas', dear?

122
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,740
Guide me in this,
Sage Vyas.

123
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,800
Either His Excellency Bhishma

124
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,680
or Vasudev Krishna
can be chosen for this ritual.

125
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,510
No, dear.

126
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,780
A person who is surrounded
by selfishness and greed

127
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,630
or there is a doubt to his
status of a righteous man

128
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,640
or is bound by the orders
of another person

129
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,640
does not have

130
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,540
the right to the
'prathamarghya.'

131
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,640
I am the General of Hastinapur.

132
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Obeying the orders
of King Dhritarashtra

133
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,560
is my prime duty.

134
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
That is why,
dear

135
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,730
I cannot accept
this 'prathamarghya.'

136
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,630
I think

137
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,500
Vasudev Krishna

138
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,730
rightfully deserves
the 'prathamarghya.'

139
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,710
Revered guests

140
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,670
righteousness,
freedom and selflessness

141
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
are three virtues
mentioned by grandsire

142
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,670
all of which reside in Vasudev.

143
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,700
We brothers have been guided
several times by Vasudev.

144
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,730
He has the knowledge of the soul

145
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,630
the beauty of the mind

146
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,530
the agility of thoughts

147
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,630
and the strength
of determination.

148
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,710
Vasudev

149
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,510
do accept the 'prathamarghya'
being offered to you.

150
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,440
Sahadev

151
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,570
cleanse the feet of Vasudev

152
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,600
and demonstrate the dedication
of us brothers towards him.

153
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,440
Did you see that?!

154
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
That was utterly foolish
of Yudhishthir!

155
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,510
Now, under no circumstance

156
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,530
will I let this 'yajna'
get completed.

157
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,310
Stop, Emperor Yudhishthir!

158
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
So many great Kings have

159
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,180
displayed their
dedication to you.

160
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,280
By choosing

161
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,350
a deceitful and cunning cowherd

162
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,180
to offer the 'prathamarghya'

163
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,150
you cannot insult us!

164
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,390
Our supreme Emperor

165
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,320
being under
the authority of a fool

166
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,420
is not something we will
accept, King Yudhishthir!

167
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,240
Crown Prince of Chedi

168
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,190
who is more deserving
than Vasudev in this court?

169
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,250
Righteousness
and unrighteousness

170
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,380
this world and the other

171
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,310
the soul and the Almighty

172
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,150
the truth and the lies

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,220
are known best

174
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,320
by no one but Vasudev.

175
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,250
All that is a lie!

176
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,350
Kings present here

177
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
if you look carefully
at the life of that Yadava

178
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,190
then you will know quite easily

179
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,260
that all he has ever done
is deceive and cheat people!

180
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,190
The milk and butter
that rightfully belonged

181
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,350
to King Kansa

182
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,180
was stolen by him
during his childhood!

183
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,380
That person

184
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,210
would instigate people
to revolt against King Kansa!

185
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,350
He led to the untimely deaths of
various friends of King Kansa.

186
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Putana,
Bakasura

187
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,360
Chanun
Mushtik...

188
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,210
The list is endless,
Kings!

189
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
He is the one who stopped people
from worshipping Lord Indra.

190
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,280
That person

191
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,120
is not only a thief

192
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,350
but also an unrighteous man.

193
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,090
He is a rebel!

194
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,220
He is a liar!

195
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,180
Can the one who heeds his advice

196
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,050
ever work towards the welfare
of the Aryan region?

197
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,280
Tell me, Kings!
How can he work towards it?!

198
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,050
Be quiet,
Crown Prince of Chedi!

199
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,280
Your rambling on about Vasudev

200
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,080
is intolerable to me!

201
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,310
So, will you kill me?

202
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,320
Bheem, is only
your exterior that big

203
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,260
or do you have
any intelligence as well?

204
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,020
Just look at that
Vrikodar Bheem, Kings!

205
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,050
Just look!

206
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,150
He married a female ogre.

207
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,050
Now, tell me, Kings...

208
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,190
How can the dog that eats
the leftovers of people

209
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,260
ever be allowed to take
part in a veneration?!

210
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,190
But such an unrighteous Vrikodar

211
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,050
is deemed highly of

212
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,260
by that treacherous Krishna!

213
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,670
But such an unrighteous Vrikodar

214
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,630
is deemed highly of

215
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,680
by that treacherous Krishna!

216
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,470
Shishupal!

217
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,670
I will behead you!

218
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,470
Calm down,
Bheem!

219
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,670
Until His Highness
awards him a punishment

220
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,580
you cannot lay a finger on him
in this court.

221
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Crown Prince of Chedi

222
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,640
do not cross your limits
in this court of mine.

223
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,510
Kings, this Yudhishthir...

224
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
He...

225
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,440
He is preaching to me
about crossing my limits

226
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,570
while he gave a runaway cowherd

227
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,410
the highest honour
in this court!

228
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,470
Yudhishthir

229
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,470
did your father

230
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,570
not teach you what is correct
and what is not?

231
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,500
But how could he?!

232
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,600
Pandu himself

233
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,570
had committed the unrighteous
deed of killing a sage.

234
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,430
Crown Prince of Chedi!

235
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
If you

236
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,370
have a problem with
our Rajsuya 'Yajna'

237
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,570
then return to your kingdom

238
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,500
and wait to confront our army!

239
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,410
I promise you

240
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,370
that until you die

241
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,380
a canopy will not be built above
brother Yudhishthir's throne!

242
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
But do not resort
to verbal abuses

243
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,530
and diminish your respect.

244
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,570
You better be quiet,
Arjun.

245
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,530
By having the right thumb
of the poor Ekalavya cut

246
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,510
you have learnt
the art of archery.

247
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,430
You are the most treacherous

248
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,430
and lying low-life
I have ever seen!

249
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,410
Go

250
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,430
and drown yourself somewhere!

251
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,460
So, Kings!

252
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,530
The father of that Krishna
was a criminal!

253
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,340
That is why,
King Kansa

254
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,500
had imprisoned
Vasudev and Devaki.

255
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,440
Now, tell me! What is a person
born in a prison cell

256
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,510
called, Kings?!

257
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
What is he?!

258
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,530
A criminal.

259
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,300
Krishna is a criminal!
A criminal!

260
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,470
Crown Prince Shishupal

261
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,330
if you do not leave
my court this instant

262
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
then I will have to
sentence you to death.

263
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,310
I do not fear anyone.

264
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,270
Get up, Kings!
Get up!

265
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,540
These cowardly Pandavas
have no competence!

266
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,310
If they had any,
Emperor Jarasandha

267
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,310
would never have been
killed deceitfully!

268
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,270
In order to prove himself

269
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,330
as the most powerful man
in the entire Aryan region

270
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,280
that treacherous Krishna

271
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,960
has weaved a web of deception.
