1
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,580
Brother-in-law

2
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,880
I accept your request.

3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,620
I...

4
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,690
I will not leave Hastinapur
and go anywhere.

5
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,560
My darling

6
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,780
you now have
everlasting protection.

7
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,560
Now, you may do anything

8
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,760
but the sons of Pandu

9
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,680
will not be able to attack you.

10
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,680
Dear Draupadi

11
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,510
always...

12
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,480
Always be there for my sons.

13
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,540
Henceforth

14
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,520
it is your duty to dispense
advice to them.

15
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,650
How can I ever give them
any advice, mother-in-law?

16
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,420
Your sons need your affection

17
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,650
and experience,
mother-in-law.

18
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,540
No, dear.

19
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,540
A mother

20
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,590
thinks of the happiness
of her sons.

21
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,450
But a wife...

22
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,390
Along with the happiness
of her husband, a wife

23
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,420
also thinks of his honour.

24
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Now...

25
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,390
Now that it is time

26
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,490
for my sons to have
their share of honour

27
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,560
and by conquering the world

28
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,350
they have the opportunity
to make their ancestors proud

29
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,440
maybe...

30
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,520
Maybe my motherly love...

31
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,380
My motherly love
may obstruct their path.

32
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,580
A decision taken by fate

33
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,390
is always correct,
dear

34
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,480
No, mother.

35
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,490
This decision of fate
is not correct.

36
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,420
Fate is hard-hearted.

37
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Without your cheerful face
to guide us

38
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,390
how will we ever
find our way, mother?

39
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,510
How will we find our way...

40
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,290
What uncle did was unjust!

41
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,450
He has no right to drive
our mother away from us.

42
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,420
How can a mother

43
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,480
ever go away
from her children, Nakul?

44
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,320
I am...

45
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,510
I am always with you.

46
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
But

47
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,480
this is my home.

48
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,350
I had come here with my husband.

49
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,410
Brother-in-law is correct.

50
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,220
I can either live here

51
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,380
or in some hermitage
in the woods.

52
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,450
Until I am alive

53
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,290
there is no other place
I can call home, son.

54
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,240
But mother...

55
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,220
This is not the time
for such things, son.

56
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,310
Do remember.

57
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,420
No matter what situation
you face in your life

58
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,280
all of you must accept the
decisions made by Yudhishthir.

59
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,250
You will not argue with him.

60
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,180
You should go now, sons.

61
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,340
I will...

62
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,190
I will employ my tears
to wash away

63
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,280
all the hurdles
that come in your path.

64
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,990
Grandsire

65
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,950
let's proceed.

66
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,140
Under your guidance,
we five brothers

67
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,050
will try to establish
a righteous kingdom.

68
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,380
I have firm faith,
Yudhishthir

69
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,240
that the prestige of our
ancestors will indeed

70
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,430
be augmented by you.

71
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,370
That you will never go astray
from the path of righteousness.

72
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Mark my words,
dear

73
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,280
that greed is the basis
of all that is unrighteous.

74
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Rule your kingdom

75
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,440
but do not ever covet it.

76
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,210
You may indeed earn wealth

77
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,400
but do not ever covet it.

78
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,380
Do not ever get envious
of someone else's wealth.

79
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,170
And

80
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,200
do not ever flaunt your wealth.

81
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,400
Only contentment and restraint

82
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,280
can strengthen
your righteousness.

83
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,330
Grandsire

84
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,240
are you not coming with us?

85
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,270
Time is a prominent
form of a 'yajna.'

86
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,340
It is a 'yajna' that
goes on for eternity.

87
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,330
In that 'yajna'

88
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,110
all of us are required to offer
ourselves as the sacrifice.

89
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,270
And that sacrifice

90
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,300
helps in the establishment
of righteousness in this world.

91
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,300
I have taken the decision

92
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,110
that now...

93
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,140
Now, it is time for me
to be the sacrifice.

94
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,040
Why did you not tell us
before, grandsire

95
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,110
that you had promised to stay
here in Hastinapur?

96
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,270
Then we would never have
asked for dividing the kingdom.

97
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,200
For this very reason, dear.

98
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,160
For exactly this reason.

99
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,100
I knew that

100
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,200
if I tell you

101
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,130
then maybe you would not
accept the new kingdom.

102
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,110
And

103
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,210
for you to have your own kingdom

104
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,210
was far more important.

105
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,210
Grandsire

106
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,110
by giving a kingdom

107
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,000
uncle has snatched
a lot from us.

108
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,070
No, dear.

109
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,970
One's cornerstone

110
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,070
is honouring the limits
of one's competence.

111
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,110
So must I.

112
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,070
Think of it like this, dear

113
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,110
that by snatching everything
you had, Dhritarashtra

114
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,010
has challenged your competence.

115
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,010
I have firm faith

116
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,200
that the city you establish
in Khandavprastha

117
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,040
will forever act as

118
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,070
the center of the entire
Aryan region.

119
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
But who will live
with us, grandsire?

120
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
A King has his subjects.

121
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,130
And for the subjects

122
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,970
to stay with their King

123
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,100
denotes the King's success.

124
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,130
Look over there.

125
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,100
All of them are with you.

126
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
King Yudhishthir

127
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,510
all of us will come with you.

128
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,490
We will help you establish
the new kingdom.

129
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,510
By leaving Hastinapur empty

130
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,550
we cannot establish
our kingdom, Vrishbhan.

131
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
When you leave

132
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,560
Hastinapur will become empty
anyway, Your Highness.

133
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,580
Take us with you.

134
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,580
We will serve you.

135
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,350
We will do what you ask us to.

136
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,520
She...

137
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,420
She is my daughter,
Your Highness.

138
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,380
She will be a handmaiden
to Her Highness.

139
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,320
She will serve her.

140
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,450
What is your name?

141
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,410
Vrushali.
