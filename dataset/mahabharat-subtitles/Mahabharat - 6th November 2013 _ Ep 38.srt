1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,070
What happened, mother Kunti?

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,140
What happened, Kunti?

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,970
I do not know, sister-in-law

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,140
but

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
it feels as though

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,000
something very bad has happened.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,080
Mother.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,910
Mother, did brother Bhim
come this way?

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,070
No

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,910
but weren't all of you together?

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,070
We were but now he's not to
be seen around, mother.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,940
I seem to be having
a premonition, mother.

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,910
Mother Kunti,
I had seen brother Bhim

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,970
going with brother Duryodhan.

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,940
But that was
quite a long time ago.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,070
If he is with Duryodhan
then you need not be afraid.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,970
He will be back.

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,880
I hope, nothing bad happened
with the two of them.

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,040
Sahadev, ask Arjun to go look
for the two of them.

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,070
Go on.
- Alright, mother.

21
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,840
Uncle!
Uncle!

22
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,840
Uncle!

23
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,670
Beloved Duryodhan, in order
to secure your place as the king

24
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,800
you have taken
the first step today.

25
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,870
Now, dump his dead body
in the river Ganges.

26
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,940
The dead bodies of people that
are submerged in the Ganges

27
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,710
go straight to heaven.

28
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
This is a popular belief.

29
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Then is he

30
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
d-dead, uncle?

31
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,880
Why are you getting
so scared, dear?

32
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,710
Death comes to all.

33
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Do remember.

34
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,840
A kingdom always thrives

35
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,880
upon a heap of dead bodies.

36
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,710
The greed for polity
engulfs every man's heart.

37
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,770
Every person makes an effort
to create a state of his own.

38
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,630
That state might be
as big as that of Kuru

39
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,810
or only limited to one's family.

40
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,570
Man always makes an effort
to gain foothold of polity.

41
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,740
But what is
the real form of polity?

42
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,710
Have we ever thought about it?

43
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,770
A person who influences
the lives of many people

44
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,570
and is able to curtail
the freedom of many

45
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,670
experiences more polity.

46
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,780
The real form of polity is one's
influence over another's life.

47
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,610
But is real influence

48
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,770
not made up of love,
kindness, compassion

49
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,800
and righteousness?

50
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,800
When man uses cruelty and
unrighteousness to gain polity

51
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,640
he gives birth to protest and
revolt in the hearts of others.

52
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,640
And the result...

53
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,680
The result
is somewhat like this.

54
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes.

55
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,740
He may find himself influential
and powerful for some time

56
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,630
but that is not true polity.

57
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,640
This is the reason

58
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,670
why sages like Bhrigu
and Vashishth are still revered

59
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,770
but not Ravan
and Hiranyakashipu.

60
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,540
Do certainly give it a thought.

61
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,640
Am I correct?

62
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,670
When gold is excavated from
the ground, King Dhritarashtra

63
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,740
it is mixed with
various forms of impurities.

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,540
Similarly, when a student
comes to a teacher

65
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,630
the love of his parents

66
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,610
and the security of a home

67
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,570
cause arrogance, fear

68
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,540
and stubbornness
as the impurities to be in him.

69
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,670
When gold is subjected to fire

70
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,640
it first starts to emit smoke.

71
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,610
This smoke

72
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,480
is due to the burning
of the impurities within it.

73
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,540
When all vile traits
are reduced to nothing

74
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,670
and when dedication
is born within a student

75
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,570
only then does he
become a disciple.

76
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,610
Only then does he accept
his teacher as his guru.

77
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,530
A teacher imparts
only knowledge to a student

78
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,530
but a guru

79
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,540
by realising the possibilities
that lie within his student

80
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,530
makes him successful.

81
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,580
I am here to become
the guru of the princes.

82
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,700
And by gaining knowledge
from you

83
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,510
the Princes of the Kuru dynasty

84
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,670
will become the best warriors
of this world.

85
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,510
This is what the royal court
of the Kuru kingdom believes

86
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,540
son of Sage Bharadwaj Drona.

87
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,640
His Highness has only
one expectation from you

88
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,710
that you must teach only
the Princes of the Kuru dynasty.

89
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,640
I too wish the same.

90
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,630
But

91
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,530
there is just one condition.

92
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,540
My son Ashwatthama will also

93
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,470
learn along with the princes.

94
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,530
Because

95
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,410
a son learns constantly
from his father.

96
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,410
We accept this condition,
Dronacharya.

97
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,600
Very soon, near the borders
of Hastinapur

98
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,480
a hermitage with various
conveniences will be built.

99
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,370
You may reside there
with your family

100
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,570
and impart knowledge
to the Princes of Kuru.

101
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,510
Pardon me, Chief Minister.

102
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,470
But the hermitage will be built
miles away from Hastinapur.

103
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,510
Because a honey bee that
does not leave its nest behind

104
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,600
and travel far away from it

105
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,570
it is unable to gather honey.

106
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,570
I do not accept this condition,
sire.

107
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,470
The Princes of Kuru

108
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,380
will live in Hastinapur
and get their education.

109
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,500
Then accepting them
as my disciples

110
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,570
isn't possible for me,
Your Highness.

111
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,380
Before making a decision,
think about it, Dronacharya.

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,340
That past incident of your life

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,330
is something the entire kingdom
of Arya is familiar with.

114
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,350
Apart from Hastinapur, is there
a kingdom powerful enough

115
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,340
that can give you shelter?

116
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,400
My Past, my weight

117
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,370
are my gems, Your Highness!

118
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,510
And I have not come here with
the wish of seeking shelter.

119
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,270
I am in search of worthy princes

120
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,500
to whom I can give charity.

121
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,510
The most noble charity
in the world.

122
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,340
That of knowledge.

123
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,270
But if the Princes of Kuru

124
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,440
value their comfort
more than my knowledge

125
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,500
then I must go someplace else
and look for my disciples.

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,500
Allow me to leave.

127
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,190
Your Highness,
with your permission

128
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,290
I would like to see off
my brother-in-law to his abode.

129
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,120
He is my guest.
- Permission granted.

130
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
And Chief Minister

131
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,050
start looking
for another teacher at once.

132
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,000
The Princes of Kuru dynasty
have always been pure gold.

133
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,060
They need not be purified.

134
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,090
They merely need to be moulded.

135
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,150
Stop, Dronacharya.

136
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,020
Do not be stubborn.

137
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,960
You will not get such
a golden opportunity again.

138
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,190
Tell this to your king.

139
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,990
The event of the past
has made you stubborn

140
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,190
but to earn money for my sister
and her son is your duty.

141
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,190
For how long can a mixture
of rice flour and water

142
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,960
be considered as milk and
consumed by my nephew?

143
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,920
I am well aware of my son
and wife's discomfort

144
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,050
Kripacharya.

145
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,090
You need not remind me of it.

146
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,960
I had knowingly
accepted this poverty.

147
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,190
And very soon, I shall acquire
immense wealth as well.

148
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,090
And the path to that
is through these steps.

149
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,160
In order to climb the steps
of the palace of Hastinapur

150
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,030
many Brahmins and Kshatriyas
are ever ready.

151
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,060
The one who can fearlessly
descend these steps

152
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,160
has the right
to ascend them as well.

153
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,890
You need not worry

154
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,950
because a guru
chooses his disciples.

155
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,960
A disciple is not wise enough
to choose his guru.

156
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,100
And I have chosen my disciples.

157
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,890
The Princes of Kuru

158
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,900
will become only my disciples.

159
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,850
Brother Bhim?

160
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,850
Brother Bhim?

161
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,830
Brother Bhim?

162
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,470
Search for son of Pandu, Bhim

163
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,240
till the boundaries
of the region of Arya!

164
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,340
Go to the farthest ends
of the earth if you have to!

165
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,420
Search for Prince Bhim
at the cost of your lives!

166
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,220
Go!

167
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,150
My son...

168
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,370
Where is he, Maha Kaal?*
*The destroyer of one who destroys i.e annihilator (Shiva).

169
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,310
Answer me!

170
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,210
How can you let a woman

171
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,170
suffer the fate
of losing her child?

172
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,310
My tears

173
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,150
will submerge
the entire universe.

174
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,210
My son...

175
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,110
Return him to me.

176
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,080
Return my Bhim to me.

177
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,050
Lord Vayu!* Where are you?
*The Lord of the winds, the father of Bhima.

178
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,220
You had promised me

179
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,150
that you shall
always protect my son.

180
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,280
He is a part of you.

181
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,310
Protect him, Lord!

182
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,120
Protect him.
