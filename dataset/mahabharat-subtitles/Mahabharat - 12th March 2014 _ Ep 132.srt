1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,440
Krishna not having a plan
at the back of his mind

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,440
is an impossibility.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,440
He has a dangerous mind.

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,530
Is he

5
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,430
looking at me?

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,500
Yes, uncle.

7
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,500
Even at Draupadi's 'swayamvar'

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,370
he had done such a thing.

9
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,400
He is calling you, uncle.

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,580
Will you go?

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,340
Yes.

12
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,410
Krishna has again made
a plan this time

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,340
and I must find out what it is.

14
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,410
Subhadra.

15
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,570
On behalf of Queen Gandhari

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,370
I have brought these items
for your adornment, dear.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,430
These are items of good fortune
for the bride-to-be, dear.

18
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Subhadra!

19
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,500
Calm down, dear.

20
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,410
Are these items
of my good fortune

21
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
or symbols of my ill-fortune?

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,370
Why are you getting me married
to Prince Duryodhan, aunt?

23
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,370
Dear

24
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,270
this...

25
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,240
This marriage,
this alliance

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,430
was approved by your
brother Balaram himself.

27
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,380
If you refuse to it now

28
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,370
then it will be an insult
to King Dhritarashtra

29
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,500
and the Kuru dynasty.

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,380
Enmity will stem between Dwarka

31
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,370
and Hastinapur.

32
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,440
But what about my feelings?

33
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,330
The fortune of a woman

34
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,370
is like the water

35
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,210
held in the palms
during a benediction.

36
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,370
If the person making
the benediction

37
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,240
does not consume it

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
then the water
falls to the earth.

39
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,440
But I have deemed your son
my husband a long time ago.

40
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,310
I am the water
in Prince Arjun's palms

41
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,340
during a benediction, aunt.

42
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,370
What...

43
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,210
What are you saying, dear?

44
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
This is

45
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,130
a complete disaster, dear.

46
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,280
Why do you not order your son

47
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,370
to come here and marry me?

48
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,330
This will not be an insult
to the Kuru dynasty

49
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,110
and I will be saved
from my ill-fortune as well.

50
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,110
Ar...

51
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,170
Arjun is bound by his oath
at the moment.

52
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
His...

53
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,300
His whereabouts are...

54
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,230
His whereabouts are
unknown to me, dear.

55
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,240
Then...

56
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Then what will
become of me, aunt?

57
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,110
Despite having two able brothers

58
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,240
do I not have the right
to choose my own life partner?

59
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,200
Will politics be my life now?

60
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,010
The alliance between
the Kurus and the Yadavas

61
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,180
was approved by

62
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Krishna himself, dear.

63
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Have faith in him.

64
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,070
Krishna will never let
unrighteousness prevail.

65
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,170
This is what Arjun had said.

66
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,180
And I believe him as well.

67
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,110
Krishna will do

68
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
what he deems correct.

69
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,260
Princess

70
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,010
Vasudev Krishna has asked you

71
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,230
to go to
the Somnath Temple at once.

72
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,240
A holy man is present there
at the moment

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and he has asked you
to invite him to Dwarka.

74
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,200
I do not wish to go anywhere.

75
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,110
Vasudev Krishna has said
that if the holy man comes here

76
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,200
then your life will be
filled with happiness.

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,100
You should go, dear.

78
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,170
Krishna must certainly have
put some thought into it

79
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,070
before asking you to do so.

80
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,130
Run...

81
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,180
Run...

82
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,970
Welcome, King of Gandhar!

83
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,170
Greetings, King of Gandhar!

84
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,070
Bless...
- Oh!

85
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,970
Be careful!

86
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,940
Bless you.

87
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,130
Welcome, King of Gandhar.

88
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,070
Hastinapur and Gandhar

89
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,970
do not have a view of the ocean.

90
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,170
So, enjoy the sea-shore
in Dwarka.

91
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Uh!

92
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,200
Boy, be careful.

93
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,970
Pardon them.

94
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,000
No, Vasudev.
No.

95
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,940
We are mountain folk.

96
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,900
We are scared of the ocean.

97
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,940
All we know is

98
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,010
that be it man's life
or the mountains

99
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,870
the one who keeps
climbing the slope undeterred

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,030
eventually reaches the summit...

101
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,930
Be careful, child.

102
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,900
Pardon them.

103
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,940
King of Gandhar,
we Yadavas only know

104
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,010
that be it the ocean
or the world

105
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,940
the one who builds
a boat of righteousness

106
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,910
sails right through.

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,130
Father, the ball.

108
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,910
This is my son Pradyumna.

109
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,030
Dear, go and seek the blessings
of the King of Gandhar.

110
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,960
Greetings.

111
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,070
May happiness fill your life!

112
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,140
Father, the ball.

113
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,840
King of Gandhar,
will you play this game with us?

114
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,000
It is one of the games I adore!

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,770
Here you go.

116
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
Let's go.

117
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,810
Greetings, holy man.

118
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,030
Our Princess is to be married.

119
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Do give her your blessings.

120
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,830
Bless you.

121
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,870
Are you asking for material
happiness from an ascetic?

122
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,810
Give me the blessing

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,030
that may my marriage
not take place today.

124
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,900
With whose order
are you getting married?

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,980
With that of my elder brother.

126
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,810
Then you should obey his order.

127
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,910
If Madhav wants

128
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,000
the Yadavas to be
on Hastinapur's side

129
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,840
then it must be correct.

130
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,830
Do you know my brother?

131
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,800
He must indeed,
Princess.

132
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,810
Holy men like him
can see even the future.

133
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,930
Nothing is hidden from them.

134
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,930
Brother Krishna has
invited you to Dwarka.

135
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,780
I am engaged
in a penance, maiden.

136
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,740
I cannot go.

137
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,970
But brother Krishna says

138
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,740
that one's penance ends
in the Somnath Temple.

139
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,870
And he has personally
asked you to come.

140
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,730
Then let's go.

141
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,710
Even I wish to see

142
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,810
what your brother has planned.

143
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,840
Vasudev

144
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,640
listen very carefully to me.

145
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,640
I love my nephews a lot.

146
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,780
I endeavour
for their happiness

147
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,900
but you are interfering in it.

148
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,780
You are foiling all my plans.

149
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,810
What is your plan?

150
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,980
What is your plan?

151
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
The throne of Hastinapur

152
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,140
rightfully belongs
to my beloved sister.

153
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,110
The Kurus have given her
a life of darkness.

154
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,270
So, she should at least

155
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,020
have the joy of the throne
and the kingdom.

156
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,980
That is it!

157
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,220
This is my plan.

158
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,050
That is a splendid plan,
King of Gandhar.

159
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,120
But how am I interfering in it?

160
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,050
Vasudev

161
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,210
if the city of Indraprastha

162
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,920
successfully conducts
the Rajsuya yajna

163
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,110
then it will become independent

164
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
and that would be

165
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,210
unjust to my sister

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,980
and nephews.

167
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,170
The entire Kuru kingdom

168
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
must once again

169
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,140
become united.

170
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,940
And it shall indeed be so,
King of Gandhar.

171
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,140
And that kingdom

172
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,040
ought to be ruled by Duryodhan.

173
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,020
And for this task, I require
the aid of the Yadavas.

174
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,880
That is why, I wish to have
beloved Duryodhan

175
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,880
and Princess Subhadra married

176
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,140
and I have even convinced
your elder brother to it.

177
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,110
And I did not interfere in it
either, King of Gandhar.

178
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,970
An alliance between
the Kurus and the Yadavas

179
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,050
is something
I approve of as well.

180
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,010
So, tell me your plan now.

181
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,080
My plan is very simple,
King of Gandhar.

182
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,880
The presence of righteousness

183
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,950
includes my presence too.

184
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,980
I shall aid in making
the Kuru kingdom united again.

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
King of Gandhar!

186
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,970
I shall aid the Kurus
and the Yadavas

187
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,110
in forming an alliance.

188
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,850
Now you must tell me

189
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,840
where I am interfering.

190
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,970
Then at this most inopportune
time, how could Arjun

191
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,950
reach the Somnath Temple,
Vasudev?

192
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,810
I am certain

193
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,880
that Arjun must have been

194
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
ordered to travel from
the North to the South

195
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,070
by you.

196
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,070
I did not order him.

197
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,070
I had merely told him

198
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,880
that visiting the Somnath Temple
would benefit him immensely

199
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,840
and that his penance
would be complete.

200
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,840
But I assure you,
King of Gandhar

201
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,010
that Arjun being at
the Somnath Temple at the moment

202
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,850
is not a part of my plans.

203
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,850
Vasudev

204
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,910
I have seen Arjun at
the Somnath Temple myself.

205
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,940
I warn you

206
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,820
that if Arjun is at
the Somnath Temple

207
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,710
because of a plan of yours

208
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,750
then Hastinapur and Dwarka

209
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,940
will become enemies.

210
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,540
If Arjun is at
the Somnath Temple

211
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,260
then Hastinapur and Dwarka

212
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,920
will become enemies.

213
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,840
A warning!

214
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,980
You are quite the comedian,
King of Gandhar!

215
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
But I do not lie.

216
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,050
However, if you
do not believe me

217
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,010
you may go to the Somnath Temple
and confirm

218
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,950
whether Arjun is present there

219
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
or not.

220
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,850
Boys!

221
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,840
Surely Arjun

222
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
has gone to Dwarka.

223
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,940
Subhadra.

224
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,680
Greetings, brother.

225
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,680
Bless you!

226
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,750
Are you angry
with your own brother?

227
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,720
It looks as though

228
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,840
even my friend is very angry.
