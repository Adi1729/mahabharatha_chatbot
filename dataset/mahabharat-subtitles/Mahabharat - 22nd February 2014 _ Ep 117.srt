1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,660
How dare you, Vidur?!

2
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,460
Divide the Kuru Kingdom!

3
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,560
How could you even
suggest such a thing?!

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,620
Did the mere thought of this
not split your head in two?!

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,630
My heart has been split, uncle.

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,460
Please pardon me, uncle!

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,660
But in a situation like this

8
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,490
this is the only solution
I could think of.

9
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,530
Quit with your rambling, Vidur!

10
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,530
This is not a solution
but a mockery!

11
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,490
A mockery of our ancestors!

12
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,530
Our ancestors
have struggled a lot

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,620
and have sacrificed many things
to make our Kuru Kingdom

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,430
the most powerful one
in the entire world!

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,530
Just look at our ancestors.

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,400
They have built
this kingdom of ours.

17
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,600
My revered father Shantanu

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,490
made this kingdom powerful.

19
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,490
He augmented the boundaries
of this kingdom

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,550
and you wish
to break it, Vidur?!

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,520
But brother Yudhishthir

22
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,450
if uncle Vidur has suggested
the kingdom to be divided

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,450
then he must have
put some thought into it.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,460
Yes, brother Yudhishthir.

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
He thought of our happiness.

26
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,590
To keep internal conflicts
from rising in the Kuru kingdom

27
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,460
he thought of this solution.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,490
But how can the division
of our motherland

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,490
ever be accepted by us?

30
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,460
But the Great Sage Vyas had said
that we must ask for our rights.

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,450
Not for us but the subjects
of our kingdom.

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,450
How can asking for one's rights

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,550
equate to dividing
the kingdom, Bheem?

34
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,550
My body shall be divided first.

35
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,490
Only then will the kingdom
get divided.

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Uncle

37
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,550
oil and water

38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,530
and never kept
in the same container.

39
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,490
They can never mix.

40
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,560
Then neither of them
is fit for any use.

41
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,330
Uncle

42
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,520
if we wish to make happiness
return to Hastinapur

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,560
then dividing the kingdom
is the sole solution.

44
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,480
Impossible!

45
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,450
I have the right to the
entire kingdom, father! Me!

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,450
This is my kingdom.

47
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,300
This is my kingdom!

48
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,490
Why should I give half of it
to the sons of Pandu, father?!

49
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,430
No one can even dare to think
of dividing this kingdom.

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,300
Had you told me before, son

51
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,290
that you had seen the sons
of Pandu alive in Kampilya

52
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,390
then... - Then what would
you have done, father?

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,350
Grandsire and the Minister

54
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,330
have always bound you
in the name of righteousness.

55
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,260
And you become weak before them
every single time.

56
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,460
That is why,

57
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,420
after declaring
brother Duryodhan

58
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,430
as King we were going
to tell you about it.

59
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,480
Father

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,460
making you resort to asceticism

61
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,190
was never my intention.

62
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,360
Grandsire and the Minister
are here to serve you.

63
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,190
They can never act
as your master.

64
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,300
And whenever
it concerns my rights

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,300
they always render
you weak, father.

66
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,200
Brother Duryodhan
is correct, father.

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,420
If you do not realize

68
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,250
the importance of your
status and position

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,260
then why would anyone else?

70
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,160
You must use your might to prove

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,350
that your decision is ultimate.

72
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,230
Grandsire will be
deeply anguished.

73
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,420
The soul of our father will be
deeply anguished, Bheem.

74
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,250
But brother Yudhishthir

75
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,260
Madhav had said that we
should have our kingdom.

76
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,230
Would refuting his advice
be correct?

77
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,290
Subjects can also be served
without gaining polity.

78
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,350
No, Arjun.

79
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,090
Just to gain hold of polity

80
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,390
we cannot have
the kingdom divided.

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,260
I shall approach His Highness

82
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,390
and step down
as the Crown Prince.

83
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,130
Do not forget that
His Highness is mighty

84
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,100
but he is so only because
of Bhishma and the Minister.

85
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,150
Both of them

86
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,220
the Minister and Bhishma

87
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,390
are the armour and weapons
of His Highness.

88
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,260
Till the time the shell
keeps a tortoise covered

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,190
it does not know defeat.

90
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,160
However, if the tortoise
falls to the ground shell first

91
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,130
it begins to squirm!

92
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,290
You seem to be forgetting the
might of us 100 brothers, uncle!

93
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,090
The army of Gandhar,
the army of Ashwatthama

94
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,160
and that of King Karna of Anga...

95
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,090
When he is backed
by these entities

96
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,320
why would father
need to be afraid?!

97
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,160
You should demonstrate
your might, father!

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,150
What do I do now,
my sons?

99
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,150
What do I do?!

100
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,030
They had taken to arms
in the court, father.

101
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,300
It was an insult to you.

102
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,290
We have a splendid opportunity

103
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,990
to defeat Yudhishthir.

104
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,130
You know quite well, father

105
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,090
that a criminal or culprit

106
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,120
has no right to be
the Crown Prince.

107
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,190
What do you mean?

108
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,020
Just think about
my suggestion, uncle.

109
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,120
Brother Dhritarashtra
too is a righteous man

110
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,960
and I am certain of it.

111
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,120
But if amber is covered
with ashes

112
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,090
then it does not give off light.

113
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,090
At the moment,
brother Dhritarashtra

114
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,060
is surrounded by Duryodhan
and the King of Gandhar.

115
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,930
Hence, he is unable
to think righteously.

116
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,960
I do not agree with you, Vidur.

117
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
I have firm faith

118
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,190
that Dhritarashtra
will heed my advice.

119
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,960
I shall remind him of his duties
towards the kingdom.

120
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,160
Great Bhishma

121
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,900
I bring an exceedingly
important news.

122
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,150
His Highness has ordered
the Pandavas

123
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,920
to be taken into custody.

124
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,120
Pardon us, Crown Prince

125
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,030
but His Highness has ordered
to take all of you into custody.

126
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,050
Greetings, great Bhishma.

127
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Where is His Highness?

128
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,990
He is performing
a 'yajna,' sire.

129
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,830
He has given the order
to not permit anyone inside.

130
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,950
Tell him Bhishma
has come to meet him.

131
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,860
I have something important
to discuss with him.

132
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,860
When one's own family
is in a crisis

133
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,050
one cannot earn merit
by performing a 'yajna.'

134
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,920
Go on!
- As you say, sire.

135
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
Soldier!

136
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,920
Is this the rope
you have to bind me?!

137
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,950
You cannot be bound even by
iron shackles, Prince Vrikodar

138
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,960
but what can I do?

139
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I am bound by orders.

140
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,020
Even I am bound by them!

141
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,730
An order is far stronger
than even lightning!

142
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,800
Otherwise there is no prison

143
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,790
on this planet

144
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,730
which can imprison
my brothers and me!

145
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,850
Calm down, Bheem.

146
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,990
Do not fret.

147
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,690
If the King has
taken us into custody

148
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,920
then we shall indeed
spend our lives in prison.

149
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,590
If the King has
taken us into custody

150
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,600
then we shall indeed
spend our lives in prison.

151
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,530
Following a King's order

152
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,530
and honouring justice...

153
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,730
If Princes do not abide by them

154
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,630
then how can the subjects
of a kingdom?

155
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,420
Panchali

156
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,390
do ask for this rope
from aunt Gandhari.

157
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,590
It is very strong.
Just look.

158
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,590
Hey!

159
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,560
It broke.

160
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,390
Soldier!

161
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,630
Bring another rope.
- Indeed.

162
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,530
Bring about ten ropes which are
used to bind an elephant.

163
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,490
And do get an order
from the Minister

164
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,500
preventing brother from breaking
the rope while having 'laddoos.'

165
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,370
How will you solve
this situation, My Lord?

166
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,400
There is only one solution,
Panchali.

167
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,360
We can apologize
to His Highness.

168
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,560
Even mother will
suggest the same.

169
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
What do you suggest,
Panchali?

170
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,390
I do not covet any land,
My Lord.

171
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,530
If I have to serve all of you

172
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,340
even in the woods

173
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,270
then I am ready to do so.

174
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
But...

175
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,430
But what, Panchali?

176
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,260
Panchali

177
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,290
do you think, we should
not apologize to the King?

178
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,460
Yes, My Lord.

179
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,470
If you are guilty
then face the punishment.

180
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,230
But if not, then protest
against this injustice.

181
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,500
What is the point
in apologizing?

182
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,430
Does apologizing have
no value, Panchali?

183
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,460
You are wise enough, My Lord.

184
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,260
How can I dispense
advice to you?

185
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,320
Nevertheless

186
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,330
in my opinion

187
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,330
if one apologizes to someone

188
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,200
inferior to him

189
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,270
then it is called valour.

190
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,360
But if someone
is stronger than you

191
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,230
then apologizing to him
is called cowardice.

192
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,550
You are correct,
Panchali.

193
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,680
Do not worry.

194
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,650
We will not apologize.

195
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,780
Let's go, soldier.

196
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,570
Panchali

197
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,750
if we will be imprisoned

198
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,780
then Hastinapur may not be
safe for you.

199
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,680
You should get ready
to leave for Kampilya.

200
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,780
Maybe this is the end

201
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,690
of your journey with us.

202
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,390
Pardon me,
great Bhishma!

203
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,650
His Highness has said that
until the 'yajna' is complete

204
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,520
he will not see anyone.
