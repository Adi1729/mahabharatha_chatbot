1
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,480
I cannot wish
for your victory, brother.

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,840
I am

3
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,040
on your opponent's side now.

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
Pardon me.

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
By giving us your
unparalleled Narayani Army

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,680
you have shown us the path
to victory, Vasudev.

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,000
Now,
even if

8
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,080
you do not wish for our victory
we will

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,160
not blame you.

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,160
King of Gandhar

11
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,720
the way the strength of a bow
lies with the archer

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,880
similarly the strength of
an army lies with its General.

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,320
The Narayani Army is indeed
a superlative one in the world

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,120
but in the absence
of an exceptional General

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,840
even the Narayani Army can fail.

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,080
We would never worry
about that, Mighty Balaram.

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,520
We have

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Maharathi Bhishma with us

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,320
as our General.

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,120
Until you have
His Excellency Bhishma with you

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,680
there is no need for the
Narayani Army, King of Gandhar.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,160
But after His Excellency
gets slain

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,240
who will lead the Narayani Army

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
as its General?

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Slaying grandsire Bhishma

26
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,640
is impossible,
Vasudev

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,760
because he has been

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,960
blessed with the boon
to die at will.

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,440
Brother

30
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
the result of a war

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,760
cannot be predetermined
like a game of dice.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,920
Even His Excellency

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,560
can die.

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,400
That is not possible,
Vasudev.

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,600
Without using treachery

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
His Excellency Bhishma

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
cannot be killed.

38
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,360
Besides,
the side you have chosen

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
is a righteous one.

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,880
You cannot use treachery.

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,000
That depends upon the definition
of treachery, King of Gandhar.

42
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,640
Lord Ram was hiding
behind a tree

43
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,280
when he attacked Bali,
the King of the Monkeys.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,160
You seemed to have
forgotten that, King of Gandhar.

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,280
And in order to slay
Dashanan Ravan

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
his brother Vibhishan

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,160
was approached for help.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,520
If righteousness is
at the core of treachery

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
then even treachery

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
can be righteous

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,560
King of Gandhar.

52
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
In other words

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,680
you will engage in treachery

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
Vasudev?

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,880
Indeed.

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,160
In this war

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,640
the Pandavas
will emerge victorious

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
by any means possible.

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,680
Maharathi Bhishma

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,760
Guru Drona

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,720
and King Karna of Anga

62
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,840
will indeed be slain

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,200
and that too by using treachery.

64
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,320
If there is

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,440
a way to safeguard
all three of them

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
then go ahead and find it.

67
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,360
Panchali

68
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,920
the time to punish
your offenders has been set.

69
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,200
The date mentioned by you
in this letter

70
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,640
will be the day
the great war begins.

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,520
The great war had begun
the very day, My Lord

72
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,960
when the thought of
a game of dice had stemmed

73
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,160
in the mind of
the King of Gandhar.

74
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
On that day

75
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,600
the reign of unrighteousness
will come to an end.

76
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,840
The one 'akshauhini'
Narayani Army of Dwaraka

77
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
will battle for us,
father.

78
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,200
We now have

79
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,560
ten 'akshauhini' armies with us

80
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,400
while the Pandavas

81
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,240
have a maximum

82
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,160
of only
seven 'akshauhini' armies.

83
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,840
They have

84
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,160
the great Yadava Krishna
with them

85
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
son Duryodhan.

86
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Even without the aid of an army

87
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
he had defeated Jarasandha

88
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,360
destroyed Kalyavan

89
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,680
and slayed
King Kansa of Mathura.

90
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,520
He...

91
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,120
And Shri Krishna is miraculous,
Your Highness.

92
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,440
The entire Aryan region
resonates of the tale

93
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,360
of how he had straightened
Trivakra's crooked back.

94
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,080
He had slayed
the female ogre Putana

95
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,880
when he was only six-months-old.

96
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,960
These are false tales,
Minister.

97
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,960
Merely false tales.

98
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
Who has seen

99
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,440
these so-called miracles?

100
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
Do not forget,
Duryodhan

101
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,440
that in this very court

102
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,800
Vasudev Krishna had defended
the honour of Drupad's daughter.

103
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,640
When Krishna
was not present here

104
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,560
how could he have
defended her, grandsire?

105
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
The daughter of Drupad
was born of fire, grandsire.

106
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
She is an illusory being.

107
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
How can someone be born of fire?

108
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
She must indeed be an ogre.

109
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,400
But we fear no one

110
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,280
and by spreading
such false tales

111
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,320
do not demonstrate

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
your fear,
grandsire.

113
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,440
Fear?

114
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
We fear for you,
Crown Prince.

115
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,360
You hope to win
with the aid of the army

116
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,840
but you seem to be forgetting

117
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,560
that if the entire army
of the crows

118
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
catches even a glimpse of Garuda

119
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,640
then the entire army
will flee from the battlefield.

120
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,160
The Garuda you are
talking about, Minister

121
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
has relinquished his beak
and claws voluntarily.

122
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,560
Vasudev will not
take to arms in this war

123
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,320
and everyone knows this.

124
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,840
Pardon me but now is
not the time to get scared

125
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,880
by thinking of the competence
of the enemy.

126
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,720
In fact, it is time for us
to examine our competence

127
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,320
and augment our self-confidence

128
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,160
because self-confidence

129
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,520
is the basis of competence.

130
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,520
Fear and apprehension are
vital for survival, dear Karna.

131
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Be calm.

132
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,880
Before the war

133
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,960
it is necessary to examine
every viewpoint.

134
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
Every viewpoint...

135
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,800
But the Pandavas have
already challenged us to a war

136
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,920
Your Highness.

137
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,480
But the Pandavas have
already challenged us to a war

138
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Your Highness.

139
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
They have even decided
the date of the war.

140
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,760
They...

141
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,720
They decided the date!

142
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,080
They decided the date...

143
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
The Pandavas seek an answer
from you, Your Highness.

144
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
Wage a war

145
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,400
or seek their refuge.

146
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,640
Seeking their refuge is out
of the question, friend Karna.

147
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
It is impossible.

148
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
We are prepared for the war!

149
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,120
Stop,
son Duryodhan.

150
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,720
Before we give them an answer,
it is vital to meditate over it.

151
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,880
Meditate?

152
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,280
Where is the time
to meditate over this, father?

153
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,760
Those Pandavas

154
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,720
have asked for an answer
from us today itself!

155
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,640
And what should we
meditate over?

156
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,360
Should we

157
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,280
meditate over
seeking their refuge, father?

158
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
No, son.

159
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,720
No.

160
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,440
I do not know if this date
will bring good fortune

161
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,520
f-for my sons or not.

162
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,920
Be calm.

163
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,480
We need to meditate over this.

164
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,080
Minister

165
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,280
the Great Sage Jaimini!

166
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,760
The Great Sage Jaimini

167
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,200
is the most renowned astrologer
in the entire Aryan region.

168
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,920
Send him an invite immediately.

169
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
As you say,
Your Highness.

170
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,800
I wish to know what
the result of this war will be.

171
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,240
I must find out whether this war

172
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,560
will benefit my sons

173
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,480
or...

174
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,640
Or will the presence of Krishna

175
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
become the good fortune
of the Pandavas.

176
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,920
Dear Abhimanyu

177
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,000
do you

178
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,120
see the gates to
the city of Virat over there?

179
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
Very soon

180
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
the formidable army of the
Pandavas will exit from there

181
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,520
and move northward

182
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,080
towards the kingdom of Kuru.

183
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,080
At that moment

184
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,720
the chariot behind the General

185
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,480
will be yours,
dear.

186
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,720
Will you be
the General, uncle?

187
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
No.

188
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,120
A person who will
not take to arms

189
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,160
cannot be the General.

190
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,040
Then who will be the General?

191
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,880
No matter who
the General is, dear

192
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,120
but the Commander

193
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
will be no one but you.

194
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,640
The task of taking this war

195
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,400
from the possibility of defeat
to the hope of victory

196
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,720
will be done by you,
dear.

197
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,480
I hope such a major
responsibility

198
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,440
does not scare you,
dear.

199
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
Why would I be scared,
uncle?

200
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,000
A sword is hungry
for blood after all.

201
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,040
A heart that has
the enthusiasm of victory

202
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,160
has no place
for the fear of death.

203
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,560
I am proud of you,
dear.

204
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,480
This war will usher a new era.

205
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,360
The old era will end

206
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,320
when His Excellency Bhishma
will be slain

207
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,680
and the new era will begin

208
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
because of you.

209
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,240
May the Empress have happiness!

210
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,240
Prince Arjun and Vasudev Krishna

211
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,040
will be here in the city
of Virat in a while.

212
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
Bring the items
for welcome, maid!

213
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,600
On my behalf

214
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,880
have gold coins and wheat
distributed in the kingdom.

215
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,600
Have a festival held!

216
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,320
Prince Abhimanyu should be
welcomed in a grand manner.

217
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,440
Make haste,
maid!

218
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,560
Are the five sons of yours not
arriving as well, Your Highness?

219
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Father has sent a message

220
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,520
that he shall be here
with the army very soon

221
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
and the five sons of mine

222
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,440
will also arrive with him.

223
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,640
Ever since we moved away
from Indraprastha

224
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,240
I have not seen them.

225
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,240
I have never seen
Prince Abhimanyu

226
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,480
and the other Princes.

227
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
I am so eager to meet
all of them, Your Highness!

228
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,120
In times of struggles

229
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,560
when a child is born
with the hope of a new future

230
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,000
one's courage gets augmented,
Your Highness.

231
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,440
People are talking solely
about Prince Abhimanyu

232
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
in the entire palace,
Your Highness.

233
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,760
And very soon,
the entire Aryan region

234
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
will talk about him.

235
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,680
He is the son of Arjun,
the bearer of the Gandiva.

236
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,840
He is the child of Subhadra,
the sister of Govind.

237
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,320
He is the disciple
of Govind himself.

238
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,840
He is the brother
of the five sons of mine.

239
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,640
Yajnaseni Panchali

240
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,280
is his mother.

241
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,560
Pardon me,
Your Highness

242
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,480
but he is not your son.

243
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,560
He is the son
of Princess Subhadra.

244
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,640
No other child can be dearer
than one's own.

245
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,920
The affection of a child
who is born of another woman

246
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,920
can never be had by us.

247
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Even if all the trees
grow in the same woods

248
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,840
not all the fruits
have the same taste.

249
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
I know quite well

250
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,280
that if you are
victorious in the war

251
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
then the Yadavas will make
Abhimanyu the next King.

252
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,680
However,
if you lose

253
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,560
then Abhimanyu
will apologize to Hastinapur

254
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
and settle in Dwaraka.

255
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,360
The only ones to make
a sacrifice for you

256
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,000
will be the five sons of yours

257
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,320
and not Abhimanyu.

258
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,240
You have not been able to
comprehend King Pandu's dynasty

259
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
Queen Sudeshna.

260
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,920
Sacrifice and righteousness

261
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,760
run through the veins
of this dynasty.
