1
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,250
'Aiming at a higher goal'

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280
'when you wish
the death of Bhishma'

3
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,310
'you will certainly become
the reason of his demise.'

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,250
'Then I do not wish to live but
I shall return in my next life.'

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,160
'And when even your soul
is fatigued and aged'

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,350
'I shall come to you
as your doom.'

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,420
'I shall hear the footsteps
of death approaching you'

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,250
'Bhishma!'

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,250
'Even when a woman takes
to arms in the battlefield'

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,420
'can any man
ever strike at her?'

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,250
'Women will not be able
to participate in this war.'

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,060
None of these pyres
belong to you.

13
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,310
Numerous young soldiers

14
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,120
will die on these in exchange
for a handful of coins.

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,150
Widowed women

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,320
will try to gather what is left
of their husbands from these.

17
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,310
Countless mothers will be seen
trying to safeguard

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
the severed heads of their sons

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,220
from hungry swine and foxes
while crying bitterly.

20
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,050
When a crow or vulture
will pluck out the eyes

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,110
of a nearly dead soldier

22
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,280
the screams of wounded soldiers

23
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,250
will drive a stake
through everyone's heart.

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,220
This land will consume the
future of countless children.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,180
Robbed of their fathers

26
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,190
children will cry silently
for the rest of their lives.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,980
However,
one aged man

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,110
will mock their misery

29
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,090
and stand right here
bearing the sins of his life.

30
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,180
In this very Kurukshetra!

31
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,020
Because he deems
his life quite lovely.

32
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,050
In order to stay alive
at this age

33
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,110
is this the web of treachery
you are weaving Bhishma?

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,180
The Almighty is my witness,
Lady Amba.

35
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,090
I have never engaged
in any treachery in my life.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,990
Neither for power nor property.

37
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,050
Neither for affection nor life.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,180
It was not my proposal
to bar women

39
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,090
from taking part in the war.

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,020
And this was not
my decision either.

41
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,150
That is a lie!

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,950
You are deceitful.

43
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,050
You are wily and treacherous!

44
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,920
Did you forget the promise
you made to Lord Shiva, Bhishma?

45
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,080
I burnt myself in a pyre as Amba

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
and that fire is still burning
within Shikhandini

47
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,910
because of you, Devavrat.
Because of you!

48
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
My life

49
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,180
my wishes

50
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,950
my happiness and my dreams
were destroyed by you, Bhishma!

51
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,950
Just take a look around you.

52
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,950
Look, Bhishma!
Take a look around you!

53
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,950
This war was born
from the dejection of the woman

54
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,960
who has spent her entire life by
covering her eyes with a cloth

55
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,020
whether she says so
explicitly or not.

56
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,020
This war was born from
the anger of her brother

57
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,920
whether you believe it or not!

58
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,980
And you are responsible
for all this, Bhishma.

59
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,050
Yet you have such greed to live!

60
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,920
How do you gather the courage
to even look at your reflection

61
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,980
in the mirror,
Bhishma?!

62
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,920
Does it not kill you with shame?

63
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,050
That too is your misfortune,
Bhishma.

64
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,820
Until I confront you

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,020
you cannot die.

66
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,880
Lady Amba

67
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
you had said

68
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,950
that when fatigue will
weigh down even my soul

69
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,920
you will come to me.

70
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,820
I am experiencing
that fatigue today.

71
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,880
These crutches

72
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,780
these herbs

73
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,010
these pyres...

74
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,790
All this is a celebration
of death amidst life.

75
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,850
My soul is dying
to have liberation

76
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,990
but I am helpless,
Lady Amba.

77
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,810
Until you return as a man

78
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,920
you will not be able
to enter this battlefield.

79
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I will indeed enter
this battlefield.

80
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,850
I will indeed have
my revenge, Bhishma!

81
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,920
In this very life!

82
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,990
In this very battlefield.

83
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,750
But before that, you must
experience your misfortune.

84
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,850
You will have to annihilate your
dynasty with your own hands.

85
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,780
Upon seeing the Kurus bleed

86
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,850
you will cry tears of blood.

87
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,820
Your misery is not yet over,
Bhishma.

88
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,860
Your heart will plead
to the Almighty for liberation.

89
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,810
Your weak soul will not be able
to bear the weight of your body.

90
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,880
Neither will your arms move
to greet someone

91
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,850
nor will your feet
allow you to march.

92
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,860
You will be rooted to the ground

93
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,750
and will be anxious to hear
the footsteps of death!

94
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,850
Await your liberation!

95
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,910
Await your death!

96
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,850
Await me!

97
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,620
'Two Days Before the War.'

98
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,780
Greetings, father.

99
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Bless you.

100
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,660
In the darkness of life

101
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,590
thinking of you has always
illuminated the path to me.

102
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,780
But today...

103
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,680
Today, in order to dispel
the darkness within me

104
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,590
I require your light, father.

105
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,550
Only your duties can dispel
the darkness within you, dear.

106
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,650
While discharging your duties

107
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,720
if someone tries
to obstruct your path

108
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,790
then be cautious.
Do not fall for his deception.

109
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,610
With this hope, I have come
to seek charity from you, son.

110
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
That is not called charity,
My Lord.

111
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,690
That is the right
of every parent.

112
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,690
When someone has
the right to bless others

113
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,680
how can he ask
for something from me?

114
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,620
I ask for just one thing
as charity.

115
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,550
Henceforth, do not engage
in any more charity, son.

116
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
I have taken an oath,
father

117
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,520
that after offering you water
early in the morning

118
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,760
if one asks me for something
over which I have a right

119
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,560
then I indeed give it away.

120
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,610
A river that descends a mountain

121
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,550
never ascends it.

122
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,580
I too cannot break my oath,
father.

123
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,610
Besides, when you yourself
are protecting someone

124
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,550
how can anyone
ever deceive that person?

125
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,750
Do not forget that your enemies
are the blessings of other Gods.

126
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,450
And these Gods are hoping
for the victory

127
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,750
and success of their sons.

128
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,720
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra

129
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,490
will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.

130
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,520
Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra

131
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,620
will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.

132
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,450
My armour and ear-rings!
- Yes, son.

133
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,430
These make you immortal

134
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,460
and denote
your divinity as well.

135
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,560
Without them,
the weapons of Arjun

136
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,660
will be able
to pierce your body.

137
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,550
But will the weapons of Arjun

138
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,550
be able to reach my body,
father?

139
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
If the statue of God
is sculpted from a rock

140
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,390
then it denotes
the divinity of the rock

141
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,460
and not its toughness.

142
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,390
My competence lies in my arms!

143
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,590
It lies in my archery, father!

144
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,420
For being concerned for my life

145
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,360
I shall always
be indebted to you.

146
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,490
However, to me

147
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,330
my oath is more important
than my life.

148
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,360
By slaying Arjun,
I will show the entire world

149
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,550
that competence is not born in a
specific dynasty, clan or sect.

150
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,360
Competence is born
in the soul of a human being.

151
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,390
If Lord Indra does not know this

152
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,390
and even his son

153
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,390
is more scared of my armour
than my archery

154
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,450
then I shall take my armour

155
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,460
and give it away willingly,
father.

156
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,490
I, Susharma,
King of Trigartha

157
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,560
pledge my weapons to you,
General Bhishma.

158
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,390
In this war,
my army and I

159
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,550
shall deem every order
of yours our duty.

160
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
If any of us
disobeys your orders

161
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,450
then may we meet with our doom.

162
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,450
Duryodhan

163
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,460
King Karna of Anga has not yet

164
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,260
pledged his loyalty to me.

165
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Grandsire

166
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,350
all these warriors
are independent.

167
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,430
That is why,
they can

168
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,420
pledge their loyalty
to anyone they like.

169
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,260
Friend Karna says

170
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,350
that his loyalty lies with me.

171
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,320
That is why,
his loyalty

172
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
cannot lie with anyone else.

173
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,260
In the battlefield

174
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,460
the orders of a General
are paramount.

175
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,290
And every soldier

176
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,420
will have to pledge his loyalty
to the General.

177
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,330
Do not forget
that along with you

178
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,420
the responsibility of security

179
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,300
of all the Kings present here

180
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,420
is on me.

181
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,160
Tell your friend Karna

182
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,290
that before the war begins

183
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,460
he must pledge
his loyalty to me.

184
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,740
King Karna of Anga.

185
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,770
Greetings,
King of Gandhar.

186
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,770
Greetings.

187
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,970
You have to pledge your loyalty
to His Excellency Bhishma

188
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
tomorrow at dawn.

189
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,800
Is that

190
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,710
an order of the Crown Prince?

191
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,970
No.

192
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,870
It is the intransigence
of His Excellency Bhishma.

193
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,980
But for this war

194
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,930
the contentment of
His Excellency Bhishma

195
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,870
is quite important.

196
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,810
The freedom of my friend

197
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,710
and him fighting according
to my wishes

198
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,740
is more important to me,
uncle.

199
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,700
My darling

200
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,930
even an ordinary soldier knows

201
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,900
that a mightier warrior
than His Excellency Bhishma

202
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,730
does not exist
in the entire world.

203
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,670
Only because he is on our side

204
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,910
is our victory certain.

205
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,910
I have conquered numerous
regions, King of Gandhar.

206
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,770
When the time comes,
I will prove

207
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,670
that my competence

208
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,740
is not less than that of
His Excellency Bhishma.

209
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,700
In his conquests

210
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,740
friend Karna has defeated
numerous Kings, uncle.

211
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,730
Their soldiers have seen

212
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,900
how the armour of my friend

213
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,800
renders their weapons powerless.

214
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,870
More than the competence
of His Excellency Bhishma

215
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,770
I have

216
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,610
faith in the armour
of my friend, uncle.

217
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Friend

218
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,830
the Pandavas and their army

219
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,670
can be defeated by me
even without my armour.

220
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,870
I know,
friend Karna

221
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,670
that your competence

222
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,770
does not lie in your armour

223
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,800
but in your armour
lies my protection.

224
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,840
Your armour has the power
to withstand even a Brahmastra.

225
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,580
If the Pandavas

226
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,830
attack me with a weapon

227
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,730
then this holy armour of yours

228
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,700
will protect me like a fort,
friend Karna.

229
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,700
Friend Karna

230
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,700
As long as you bear your armour

231
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,700
and stand before me

232
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,610
it is impossible to kill me.

233
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,630
This armour of yours makes
you invincible, friend.

234
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,610
However,
it makes me immortal.

235
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,540
Your holy armour is

236
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,710
undoubtedly important to you.

237
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,670
However,
it is

238
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,770
more important to me,
friend.

239
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,730
'Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra'

240
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,600
'will come to you to ask for
your ear-rings and armour.'
