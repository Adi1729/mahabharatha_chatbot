1
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,060
Queen Kunti.

2
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,000
Upon your arrival in Hastinapur,
I wanted to be the first one

3
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,940
to welcome you
with these lotuses.

4
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,030
The truth is...

5
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,130
My heart never abandoned
that desire.

6
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,060
Whenever I see lotuses

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,970
I am reminded of your feet,
Queen.

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,030
If you stand silently like this

9
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,940
I shall consider that you have
not accepted this flower, Queen.

10
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,900
But

11
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,970
flowers are offered
only to sages

12
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,030
and at the feet of the Almighty.

13
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,040
I am not worthy of this.

14
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,070
But are mothers not another
form of the Almighty, Queen?

15
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,940
And my father had taught me
in my childhood

16
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,030
that the king and the queen

17
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,910
are the father and mother
of the subjects.

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,030
That is why, as a child,
I had the desire

19
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,830
to convey to Queen Kunti of
all the injustice done to me

20
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,800
so that she would help me
get justice as my mother.

21
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,870
When my own mother has forsaken
me for the fear of the society

22
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,000
then what can I expect
from anyone else?

23
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,830
What do you mean?

24
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,030
Just now, my mother

25
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,770
has refused to reside with me
in my palace, Queen.

26
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,870
Goodbye.

27
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,890
Son.

28
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,760
You...

29
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,730
You may think of me
as your mother.

30
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,860
I did not come to the palace
to look for a new mother, Queen.

31
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,700
My mother has forsaken me.

32
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,870
But I have not forsaken her.

33
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,740
This was just an old wish
that I fulfilled today.

34
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,670
Besides

35
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
by calling the mother
of my arch enemy

36
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,760
as my own, I do not wish to let
the fire of my enmity die out.

37
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,870
Why this enmity, son?

38
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,840
I...

39
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,740
I saw you in the arena.

40
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,770
You are a remarkable warrior.

41
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,930
You and Arjun are archers
of equal skills.

42
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,730
We are not equals.

43
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,870
I am a more superior archer
than your son.

44
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,770
And this enmity stems
from the fact

45
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,710
that the place Arjun
was given today in the arena

46
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,860
is mine.

47
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,890
And the place where
you are to be seated

48
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,830
I would never wish
to be seated there.

49
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,630
I have no place at
the feet of Prince Duryodhan.

50
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,870
In other words, you may
deem me as your competitor

51
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,570
but I do not deem you as mine.

52
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,670
Arjun.

53
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,610
Arrogance corrodes valour

54
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,640
as mercury corrodes gold.

55
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,740
Are you telling all this
to brother Arjun

56
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,730
or to the King of Anga Pradesh,
Karna?

57
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,240
What is the point of saying so
to King of Anga Pradesh, Nakul?

58
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,730
Mercury corrodes gold

59
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,730
and not iron.

60
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,670
And where valour is nothing
but a few fancy tricks

61
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,790
it is termed not as gold

62
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,800
but iron.
Iron.

63
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,600
Sahadev.

64
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,710
Do not use
such insulting language.

65
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,670
Karna...

66
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,800
King of Anga Pradesh, Karna,
is your

67
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,760
elder brother...

68
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,570
He is like your elder brother.

69
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,560
Indeed, mother.

70
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,770
He is just like our
elder brother Duryodhan.

71
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,600
King of Anga Pradesh
is just like him.

72
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,690
The same arrogance

73
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,600
and the same ignorance.

74
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,500
You are correct, mother.

75
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,540
He is just like him.
There is no difference, mother.

76
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,570
And our weapons
shall not differentiate either.

77
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,540
Arjun!

78
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,530
Stay within your limits.

79
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,660
King of Anga Pradesh,
you are welcome here.

80
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,670
Neither are we angry with you

81
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,560
nor do we bear
any feeling of competition.

82
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,700
But I do.

83
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,470
I have a reason to be both angry
and have the competitive spirit.

84
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,630
Oh Princes, who cherish
their birth as their ornaments

85
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,430
do remember

86
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,670
that in the actual battlefield

87
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,440
all will know the truth
about their valour and birth.

88
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,590
And Arjun.

89
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,400
If we ever cross paths
in the battlefield someday

90
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,630
then you will be destined
to die at my hands.

91
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,440
I give you my word.

92
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,530
If we ever cross paths
in the battlefield someday

93
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,510
then you will be destined
to die at my hands.

94
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,530
I give you my word.

95
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,510
Warriors are bound to cross each
other's paths in the battlefield

96
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,540
King of Anga Pradesh.

97
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,300
And not in a village fair.

98
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,340
And as for your promise

99
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,340
I shall remind you myself
about it.

100
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,300
Let's go, mother.

101
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,430
My son!

102
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,310
My son, Duryodhan.

103
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,330
Hearing of your prowess today
gave me great solace, son.

104
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,270
The earth was trembling today
with the sound of your feet.

105
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,360
The sound of your mace
felt as though

106
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,170
there were a battle
between the clouds, son.

107
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,330
Greetings.

108
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,370
After all, you have given
elder brother such a name.

109
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,200
He is Duryodhan!

110
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,240
Fighting him

111
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,300
will not be easy.

112
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,170
You are correct, Dusshasan.

113
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,290
Besides

114
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,270
the companionship and
protection of his 99 brothers

115
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,300
will always be with Duryodhan.

116
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,260
The truth is,
Duryodhan is invincible.

117
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,240
And your sons are inarguably
the most superior, father!

118
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Go on, son.

119
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,200
Greetings, grandfather.

120
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,330
May you be prosperous, Prince.

121
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,340
Had there been a verdict
to today's competition

122
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,300
then the words of His Highness

123
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,330
would have seemed true.

124
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,330
There was no verdict?

125
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,240
I defeated four of the Pandavas
before everyone, grandfather.

126
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,300
The warrior left standing
at sundown

127
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,300
was not you.

128
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,040
It was not Prince Arjun either,
Your Excellency.

129
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,040
The King of Anga Pradesh,
Karna, was standing before him.

130
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Undefeated.
- That is why, this competition

131
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,070
did not have any verdict.
- But grandfather

132
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,170
that undefeated warrior
is on my side now.

133
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,070
My friend and my associate.

134
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,010
In other words, my side
is more powerful right now.

135
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,040
And, Your Excellency

136
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,100
my beloved nephew has proved

137
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,040
that he is not only
a fine warrior

138
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,110
but also has the capacity
to become a fine prince.

139
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,040
By declaring Karna
as the King of Anga Pradesh

140
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,160
he brought governance
to the kingdom of Anga

141
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,230
he surrounded the enemy kingdom
of Magadha

142
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,200
and magnified his strength
and that of his kingdom greatly.

143
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,140
Alliance and sabotage

144
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,160
Duryodhan has knowledge
of both these concepts.

145
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,060
Your Excellency

146
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,940
even a prince is required
to perform these duties.

147
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:11,130
Physical might is not the only
requirement to rule a kingdom.

148
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,100
You are correct, uncle!

149
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,060
In order to protect themselves
from the lion

150
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,110
the small and weak animals
of the jungle

151
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,930
had made an army once.

152
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,160
Our teacher had narrated
such a tale to us.

153
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,940
The ones who do not have
strength in their limbs

154
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,940
only they speak of alliances,
uncle.

155
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,300
Greetings, your Majesty.

156
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,270
May you live long, son.

157
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,330
To know about the strength
of my limbs

158
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,100
you can inquire
the four brothers of yours

159
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,330
who got a taste of the ground
of the arena today.

160
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,070
You are right.

161
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,270
We did get just a taste of it.

162
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,300
Tomorrow, I will eat and digest
the whole of the arena.

163
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,140
And if you wish
to see it for yourself

164
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,300
then be present in the arena.

165
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,270
My name is Vrakodar.

166
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,190
Vrakodar.

167
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,260
Calm down, Bheem!

168
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,300
The competition
has now ended, son.

169
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,170
Now, expunge the thoughts of
the competition from your mind.

170
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,330
May all of you be prosperous!

171
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,100
Today's competition

172
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,200
was only about physical might.

173
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,200
No other capabilities

174
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,210
were being tested today.

175
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,140
That is why, this competition

176
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,200
did not have a verdict.

177
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,000
Today, the princes who
took part in this competition

178
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,170
and displayed their art

179
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,970
have brought contentment
to all of us.

180
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,210
If no verdict could be reached

181
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,970
then have the competition
held again tomorrow, father.

182
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,000
I am willing to participate.

183
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,210
Let it be, brother Duryodhan.

184
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,200
No verdict could be reached
for the competition today.

185
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,970
If the verdict for
the competition is out tomorrow

186
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,200
then you will be
defamed greatly.

187
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Allow us to leave now, uncle.
