1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,240
The way

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,090
this court has been
drowned in darkness

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,100
similarly,
King Dhritarashtra

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,200
we will fill

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,170
your life with darkness!

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,200
We will fill it with darkness!

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,300
What kind of nefariousness
is this, Duryodhan?!

8
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,100
Brother Yudhishthir,
just give us the order.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,210
Let us resort to arms,
brother Yudhishthir!

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,200
Duryodhan!

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,140
I will annihilate
every bit of this palace!

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,210
Brother Yudhishthir,
either kill all of us

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,070
or give us the order
to kill this Duryodhan!

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,130
Duryodhan!

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,260
The court of Hastinapur

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,300
has never witnessed
such misbehaviour!

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,200
Think of the propriety
of the Kuru dynasty

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,070
just this once.

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,260
Just this once...

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,200
King Dhritarashtra!

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,300
Open the eyes of your heart!

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,270
Do not allow unrighteousness
of this gravity in your court.

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,130
Crown Prince Duryodhan!

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,140
No such thing can happen
in the court of the Kurus!

25
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,140
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,070
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,260
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

28
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,170
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

29
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,100
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,130
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,040
This cannot happen!
- Your Highness, this cannot be!

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,140
Be quiet!
Quiet!

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,200
Ask Yudhishthir!

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,070
Can a master not punish
his servants and maids?!

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,110
Are you, your brothers
and Draupadi

36
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,070
not my servants and maid?!

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,100
Answer me,
Yudhishthir!

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,000
We are.

39
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,970
We are your servants and maid

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,160
but what kind
of a punishment is this?

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,070
I am not a maid!

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,010
A kingdom is conquered
with might, Duryodhan!

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,990
Not with treachery!

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,130
Look at that,
grandsire!

45
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,910
Just look at the behaviour
of that maid!

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,170
Is punishing her
not the correct thing to do?!

47
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,960
It is incorrect!

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,970
Enough of this,
Duryodhan!

49
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,060
Enough of this!

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,900
This is reprehensible!

51
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,000
And upon seeing such
reprehensible behaviour

52
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,130
I cannot stay in this court
even a moment longer!

53
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,940
Stop, Your Excellency Bhishma!

54
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,110
Uncle, you had promised me

55
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,960
that my sons and I

56
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,000
will never be abandoned by you.

57
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,010
'I, the son of Ganga'

58
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,000
'swear on the purity
of my mother'

59
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,040
'that I will not be
the King of Hastinapur'

60
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,930
'but spend my entire life
as its servant!'

61
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,870
'Until you are
the King of Hastinapur'

62
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,960
'I shall serve you and
Hastinapur as its servant'

63
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,040
'and deem every word
of yours an order.'

64
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,100
Be seated now

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,060
Your Excellency.

66
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,800
Say it,
grandsire.

67
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,930
Dear Draupadi

68
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,810
it has been proved

69
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,870
that you...

70
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,930
You are

71
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,790
a maid.

72
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,760
Crown Prince Duryodhan

73
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,830
the correct mode of punishing
servants and maids

74
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,770
has been specified
in our judicial system.

75
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,700
But a maid

76
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,830
being stripped of her clothes

77
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,810
is not something that is
present in any judicial system.

78
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
What's the punishment for taking
to arms in the court, Minister?

79
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,800
In the court of Indraprastha

80
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,810
were we punished according
to the judicial system?

81
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
No, Minister.

82
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Only to insult us warriors

83
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,840
our weapons
were snatched from us.

84
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,900
Even you were present there.

85
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,670
Why were you quiet then?!

86
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,770
Warrior?

87
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,860
Had you been a warrior

88
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,770
you would have been
in a battlefield.

89
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,730
You would not have been
a part of this treachery.

90
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,710
There are many monkeys who have
long hair on their heads

91
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,730
but no one calls them
a lion because of it!

92
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,790
Draupadi!

93
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,840
Do not argue,
King of Anga.

94
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,790
Do not argue.

95
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,670
Duryodhan

96
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,810
this court cannot allow a woman

97
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,800
to get insulted in this manner.

98
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,830
My darling

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,870
give up the idea
of disrobing Draupadi.

100
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,840
Uncle!

101
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,660
I am correct,
my darling.

102
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,670
The environment of the court
is not favourable.

103
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,760
The correct thing to do would be

104
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,610
to utilize this time
effectively.

105
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,570
The great guru Drona
and His Excellency Bhishma

106
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,570
are 'Maharathis'
and you must

107
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,760
bring them to your side

108
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,570
so that in the future

109
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,770
they draw their weapons

110
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,770
only at your command.

111
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,540
Alright.

112
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,770
Alright.

113
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,670
If everyone present in the court

114
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,670
gives up their weapons to me

115
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,730
and pleads with me

116
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,800
only then will I think

117
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,630
of letting maid Draupadi

118
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,630
go off the hook.

119
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,540
Plead with me,
guru Drona!

120
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,740
Your Excellency Bhishma

121
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,600
Minister

122
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,500
plead with me!

123
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,730
And you...
You five servants

124
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,570
must also plead with me!

125
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,470
All of you must plead with me!

126
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,720
Duryodhan

127
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,600
all of us will give up
our weapons

128
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,650
but all of us

129
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,490
plead with you

130
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,690
to pardon

131
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,750
Draupadi now.

132
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,650
Grandsire

133
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,530
I had promised to think about it

134
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,560
and I have made up my mind.

135
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Maid Draupadi

136
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
cannot be pardoned by me.

137
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,590
I cannot!

138
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,690
Dusshasan!

139
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,550
Dusshasan,
go on

140
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,660
and strip maid Draupadi
of her clothes!

141
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,550
Stop, brother Dusshasan.

142
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,620
Brother Duryodhan,
listen to me.

143
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,650
Without the knowledge
of right and wrong

144
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,420
no person can ever become King

145
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,490
but you are the Emperor now!

146
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,490
If you let
such injustice prevail

147
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,500
the subjects of the Aryan region
will revolt against you.

148
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,630
Vikarna, whose side are you on?

149
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,600
Have you forgotten your father

150
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,390
and deemed Pandu
to be your father now?!

151
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,590
Brother Dusshasan, giving sound
advice to one's elder brother

152
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,530
does not imply
revolting against him.

153
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,520
Brother Duryodhan,
when a King loses in a battle

154
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,550
he is bound to give up
his weapons

155
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,600
but no woman should be
disrobed in this manner!

156
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,590
A warrior being
robbed of his weapons

157
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,600
and a woman being disrobed
are two different things.

158
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,380
The daughter of Drupad

159
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,430
is the honour
of the Kuru dynasty

160
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,550
and that is the truth.

161
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,590
Honour of the dynasty!

162
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,430
What are you saying,
Vikarna?

163
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,450
If having long hair on his head
does not make a monkey a lion

164
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,400
then wearing a married
woman's head ornament

165
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,360
does not make a woman pure.

166
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,400
The fruits of the Cannabis plant
are fruits as well, Vikarna

167
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
but they are not
at par with mangoes.

168
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
How can you call such a woman
to be honourable?

169
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,350
A woman

170
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,530
who has relationships
with five men!

171
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,550
Such women are harlots!

172
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,520
Whether such women
are clothed are not

173
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,550
makes absolutely no difference!

174
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,450
Dusshasan

175
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,360
strip that maid of her clothes!

176
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,520
Duryodhan

177
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,260
please do not commit
such a misdeed!

178
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,360
Stop, Dusshasan!

179
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,260
Be quiet!

180
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,260
Be quiet,
guru Drona.

181
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,300
Please be quiet,
His Excellency.

182
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,390
And you as well

183
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,450
sons of Pandu.

184
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,350
You should also be quiet now.

185
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,290
Protecting me

186
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,390
is out of your league now.

187
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,460
The courage to stop
this unrighteousness

188
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,320
in the name of righteousness
resides with none of you!

189
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,390
What good is righteousness

190
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,260
if it turns one's strength
into one's weakness?

191
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,420
What good is the truth

192
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,160
if it does not incinerate
the deeds of wicked people

193
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,460
but the courage
of the person speaking it?

194
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,290
What good is the truth

195
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,290
if it does not incinerate
the deeds of wicked people

196
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,290
but the courage
of the person speaking it?

197
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,360
None of you have understood
the true form of righteousness.

198
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,090
An earthen lamp
does provide luminance

199
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,350
but when the flame gets
extinguished, the same lamp

200
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,180
blackens the hands as well!

201
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,280
And the righteousness
residing within all of you

202
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,180
has lost its luminance now.

203
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,260
That is why,
protecting me

204
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,130
is out of your league now.

205
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,180
If I am

206
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,190
to be protected now

207
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,180
then the Almighty himself
will do so.

208
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,050
Come, Dusshasan.

209
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,080
Come and test your might.

210
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,950
Govind.
