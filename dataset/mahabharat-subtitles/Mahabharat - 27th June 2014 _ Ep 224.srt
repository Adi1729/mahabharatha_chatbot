1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,790
"The tenth day of war"

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,710
My child.

3
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,750
Till the end of this day.
We must repel grandsire

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,690
away from lady Shikhandini.
Once we find a chance.

5
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,760
We need to kill lady Shikhandini.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,670
That's our goal today.

7
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,660
Lady Shikhandini!
The entire Kaurava army

8
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,870
will attempt to keep you
away from grandsire.

9
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,700
Their only intention
will be to kill you.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,720
I and the whole Pandava army...

11
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,620
will shield you.

12
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,760
In order to get you.
They'll have to defeat all of us.

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,590
Warriors!

14
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,850
Today, we have one goal!
One objective and one plan.

15
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,650
We must aid Shikhandini
to get to grandsire by all means.

16
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,700
All these days anticipation which've been stymied. 
Grandsire's annihilation.

17
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,740
Today, we must lift our effort manifold.
In order to protect her.

18
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,780
Today, before sunset.
We must make grandsire...

19
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,720
lay down his weapon by all means.

20
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,760
Hail Mahadev.

21
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,690
Your survival essential
for my victory, grandsire.

22
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,700
My dead is essential 
for my liberation.

23
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,640
I will not let you die, 
grandsire.

24
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,870
Though you are present
on the battlefield,

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,740
the Pandava army will never
be able to reach to you.

26
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,810
A walls made of bamboo,

27
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,660
can stop the wind
but not hurricane.

28
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,660
Look there.

29
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,570
Soldiers!

30
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,740
Attack!

31
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:02,720
Attack!

32
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,590
Hail Mahadev!

33
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,770
This is mandatory to stop
Arjuna and Vasudev, friend.

34
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
If we don't stop them.

35
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,650
They will aid lady Shikhandini
reach grandsire.

36
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,690
The only person who can
confront Arjuna...

37
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,560
is the one who taught 
him in warfare.

38
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,770
Arjuna, accept this gesture.

39
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,750
If you get defeated.

40
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,700
I will be proud of my capability.

41
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,570
If you win, I will be proud
of my teaching.

42
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,830
Give me a reason to be proud.

43
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,680
- Pick up your weapon.
- Master!

44
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,680
Not even Lord Indra can stop me.

45
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,840
For getting lady Shikhandini
to grandsire today.

46
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,690
Today, you'll have to satisfy yourself,

47
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
with the pride of your teaching.

48
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,760
And accept your death by my hands.

49
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,810
Death is decided only by God.

50
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,780
You ought to accept your defeat by my hands.

51
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,780
Nobody can stop me from getting to
Grandsire today.

52
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,800
Nakul.

53
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,640
Ashwathama is fighting a duel 
with Lady Shikandini.

54
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,870
We must help him.

55
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,580
Soldiers.

56
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,690
Direct the launchers towards Bheem.

57
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,650
Crush Bheem's army.

58
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,810
Go to Grandsire,

59
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,790
I will keep Ashwathama busy.

60
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,630
Master's son, Ashwathama.

61
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,860
My sword is desperate to get
introduced to you.

62
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,640
What are you waiting for?

63
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,790
Before facing Grandsire you must 
fight a duel with me.

64
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,660
My brother spared your life 
in the Panchal war.

65
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,610
But I am not as kind as him.

66
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,670
Death's the only punishment 
I can offer you.

67
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,660
Get to Grandsire.

68
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,770
Dusshasan should also get a chance.

69
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,800
To use his spear to fight.

70
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,880
Pick up the spear, Dusshasan.

71
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,850
Let your brother realize that 
you are a warrior.

72
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,820
What is the situation, Sanjay?

73
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,760
When is the sunset?

74
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Three more hours, Your majesty.

75
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,690
Lady Shikhandini is wounded.

76
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,670
And is trying to progress towards Grandsire,
your majesty.

77
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,740
In these hours.

78
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,610
Lady Shikhandini should be unsuccessful
in all attempts.

79
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
If Grandsire's death is avoided.

80
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,750
Our army's victory will be inevitable.

81
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,820
Yes.

82
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,690
Where is Lady Shikhandini?

83
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,750
You have the body of a man.

84
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,750
But you...

85
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,830
You still battle like a woman!

86
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,950
my lady.

87
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Just look at you.

88
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,970
Your entire body is scarlet 
with blood.

89
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,030
Your breath seeks permission
to leave your body.

90
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,010
However...

91
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Your heart...

92
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,970
Your heart does not allow you to forget 
taking your revenge.

93
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,950
Take the decision to live, 
My Lady.

94
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,990
I shall allow you to leave 
the battlefield.

95
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,800
Revenge is the sole aim
of this birth of mine.

96
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,940
Remembering it is the 
basis of my life.

97
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,910
To my darling Duryodhan. His Excelency Bhisma's life is very important, My Lady!

98
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,810
However, to ensure His Excellency 
Bhishma's life,

99
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,810
your death is not mandatory.

100
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,860
This is why, I only need to hold you 
off till sundown.

101
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,920
After which, neither will you be
able to enter the battlefield.

102
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:53,900
Nor will dream of victory 
of the Pandavas.

103
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,000
His Excellency is looking constantly 
at the sun, Your Highness.

104
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,970
As though he wish to prevent the sun from setting in the sky just for a little while.

105
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,950
Where is Shikhandi, Sanjay?

106
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,810
King of Gandhar is holding
Shikhandi off, majesty.

107
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,900
Guru Drona is not allowing Prince Arjuna 
to move forth, Your Highness.

108
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,730
Prince Nakula is battling
Ashwathama, Your Highness.

109
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,900
Crown Prince Duryodhan is hurling rocks at 
Prince Bheem, Your Highness.

110
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,780
All the Pandavas are miles away from 
Shikhandi, Your Highness.

111
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,790
Those Pandavas are the armour 
of Shikhandi, Sanjay.

112
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,020
If Shikhandi is away from this armour.

113
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Reaching uncle is impossible 
for him, Sanjay.

114
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,030
It's impossible.

115
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,970
In other words...

116
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,030
In other words,

117
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,880
our army win.

118
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:51,020
You will see, Vidur. King of Gandhar 
will not fail.

119
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,790
Never.

120
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,810
My victory is a boon granted 
by Mahadev himself.

121
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,040
You cannot render it futile,
King Shakuni of Gandhar.

122
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,940
In order to realize Mahadev boon,

123
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,930
you will have to be born 
again, My Lady.

124
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,950
The birth of yours

125
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,020
was futile!

126
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,580
Lady Shikhandini!

127
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,730
"An injured Shikhandi is being
taken by Prince Abhimanyu"

128
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,570
"to the camp of the Pandavas,
Your Highness."

129
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,550
He has lost a lot of blood.

130
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,710
His life is in danger,
Your Highness.

131
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,690
Splendid.

132
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,500
Splendid, Sanjay.
Splendid!

133
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,630
In other words

134
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,670
if Shikhandi is injured

135
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,670
then he will not be able to battle.

136
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,620
And if he is not present before uncle

137
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,650
then killing uncle will be
impossible.

138
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,490
Mother Draupadi!

139
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,600
Sister!

140
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,500
Mother Draupadi,
he has lost a lot of blood.

141
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,590
Take her over there.

142
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,530
Abhimanyu, go and call your uncles 
Nakul and Sahadev

143
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,510
to camp at once.

144
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,510
Only their special
herbs can heal sister.

145
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,550
Leave at once!

146
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,530
Friend

147
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,640
the sun is about to set.

148
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,640
Did Shikhandi
reach grandsire or not?

149
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,640
Shikandi is merely the cause.

150
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,670
Your weapons shall be of use in this.

151
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,680
You need to focus

152
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,680
your attention on your duty.

153
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
At the moment,
it is your duty

154
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,620
to defeat Guru Drona.

155
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,640
Mother-in-law,
his breathing is irregular!

156
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,710
Why are my lords Nakul and Sahadev

157
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,650
not here yet?

158
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,530
Mother-in-law,
do something!

159
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,660
No!

160
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,560
Without fulfilling one's oath

161
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,730
no one has the right to die,
sister!

162
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,610
Get up!

163
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,740
Get up, sister!
Get up!

164
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,710
Try to recall, sister...
Try to recall

165
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,780
your meditation.

166
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,720
Try to recall your oath,
sister.

167
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,550
Try to recall
Mahadev's blessing.

168
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,720
Sister!
Get up, sister!

169
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,530
Get up, sister!

170
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,640
Lord Parashuram
had taken to arms for you!

171
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,730
Today,
you must take to arms!

172
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,540
Get up, sister.
Sister!

173
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,680
When lightning strikes in the sky

174
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,620
it indeed wreaks
havoc on earth.

175
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,520
You are like a powerful weapon
borne by a God, sister.

176
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,720
You are Indra's "vajra"!

177
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,720
Get up, sister.

178
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,490
Get up and wreak havoc!

179
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,690
Get up,
sister!

180
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,560
Get up,
sister!

181
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Get up!

182
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,500
You are the basis of victory
in this war of righteousness.

183
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,630
Sister!

184
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,730
Sister,
you must get up!

185
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,610
Sister!

186
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,540
Get up,
sister.
