1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,110
When the Almighty himself
is the charioteer

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,270
and justice and righteousness

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,140
are the wheels of that chariot

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,040
the flag atop it

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,300
shall always be blessed by me.

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,230
May you be victorious.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
There is another
basis of might, Bheem.

8
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,030
And that is

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,170
a tail

10
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,040
which you do not have.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,240
I am on my way,
Duryodhan

12
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,980
with the might of Lord Hanuman,
son of Pavan Dev, in my arms.

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,070
I am on my way!

14
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,170
Splendid, my darling!
Splendid! - Uncle!

15
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,970
Brother! I have some bad news,
brother Duryodhan!

16
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,970
I have heard from various sages

17
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,980
that Bheem has pleased
Lord Hanuman!

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,980
And being pleased with him,
Lord Hanuman

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,030
has provided him with His might,
brother Duryodhan.

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,940
I do not fear Bheem one bit!

21
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,040
I do not!

22
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,900
My darling!

23
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,110
I have heard that Arjun seeks
to acquire the Pashupatastra

24
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,110
brother Duryodhan.

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,030
And the Pandavas are gathering
an army of competent people.

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,030
The Pandavas

27
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,910
will engage in a battle

28
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,940
only when they are successful

29
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,130
in their life of anonymity.

30
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,070
At the dawn

31
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,140
of their life of anonymity

32
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,080
the Pandavas

33
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,040
will be standing before us

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,840
and we shall

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,930
send them back on an exile.

36
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,910
Uncle, why would the Pandavas
come and stand before us?

37
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,840
To protect their wife.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you lift a trident
by its shaft

39
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,040
then the three of its prongs

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,870
come along with it.

41
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,830
Just a day before

42
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,040
their life of anonymity begins

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,910
Draupadi will be

44
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,780
abducted by us!

45
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,810
The method to heal

46
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
the wounds of our army quickly

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,930
was taught to us
by the Ashwini Kumaras.

48
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,030
And not only that.

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,910
They also taught us how
to heal horses and elephants.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,940
When the battle comes
to a halt at sunset

51
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,870
the soldiers who are wounded

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,870
will not die
because of the wounds.

53
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,000
We shall heal them
by the crack of dawn.

54
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,840
After pleasing Lord Shiva,
when Arjun

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,830
will acquire the Pashupatastra

56
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,910
we will never get defeated
by grandsire and guru Drona.

57
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,840
Panchali, all the sages
and guests

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,900
have left after having a meal.

59
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,970
I hope you have kept
food aside for yourself.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
There is sufficient
food for me, My Lord.

61
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,730
I have set aside
extra food for you.

62
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,770
Enough"

63
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,810
I do not want more.

64
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,880
If it is too much for you
then let me have some.

65
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,810
Panchali

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,830
you should begin
your meal as well.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
This is enough for all of us.

68
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,870
Yes, Panchali.

69
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,810
Let me serve

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,740
the entire contents of this pot
on your plate.

71
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,770
If it is too much for you,
you may give me some.

72
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,640
Is there a householder
in this hut

73
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,840
who can give a meal to us sages

74
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,840
or has the entire world
fallen prey to unrighteousness?!

75
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,640
Great sage Durvasa!

76
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,810
Greetings!

77
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,670
Welcome.
- Prince

78
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,670
sweet talk does not
satiate a person.

79
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,870
Since you are a householder now

80
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,700
you must provide
us sages with a meal.

81
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,610
My disciples and I shall
have a meal at your residence.

82
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,740
Princes, arrange for
a place to sit for us

83
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,810
and you

84
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
must tell your wife

85
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,830
to arrange for a meal for us.

86
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,740
As you say,
great sage.

87
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,670
Bheem, Sahadev, arrange for
a place to sit for the sages.

88
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,780
Nakul, go and place clean
plantain leaves for the meal.

89
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,730
Let me go aid Panchali.

90
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,770
Alright.

91
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,700
Great sage Durvasa is here!

92
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,770
At this time?
- Panchali, guests

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,610
always arrive unannounced.

94
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,800
We must offer them a meal.

95
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,700
Vasudev made us take a vow

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,710
to ensure that sages
leave this place contented

97
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,630
so that we can earn merit.

98
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,810
Upon hearing of this vow
of ours, great sage Durvasa

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,830
must have come here to test us.

100
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,570
But all the food that we had

101
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,770
has already been
served by me, My Lord.

102
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,580
I even served food on my plate.

103
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,570
Now, how can we serve him a
meal which was intended for us?

104
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,730
That amount would not have
sufficed anyhow, Panchali.

105
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,680
More than 100 disciples have
accompanied the great sage.

106
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,700
You must prepare something.

107
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,780
I do not even have
enough grains with me

108
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
that I can prepare
something, My Lord.

109
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,770
The one who takes a test

110
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,610
comes with the intention
of leaving discontented.

111
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,670
No one can ever make the tester
leave feeling utterly contented.

112
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,740
And everyone is familiar with
the wrath of great sage Durvasa.

113
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,710
If he is not contented

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,580
then he will certainly curse us.

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
How will we ever be able
to give him a satisfactory meal?

116
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,770
Prince!
- Yes?

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,600
Tell the daughter of Drupad

118
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,570
that after being seated
for a meal, great sage Durvasa

119
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,540
does not have
the habit of waiting.

120
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,610
Tell her to serve
our meaIs this instant

121
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,470
otherwise we shall leave
on an empty stomach.

122
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,700
Such a situation
will never arise, great sage.

123
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,640
Your meal will be here
in just a while.

124
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Do not interrupt me,
impudent man!

125
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,470
Tell her

126
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,540
that if great sage Durvasa
is not contented

127
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,580
then the future of the Pandavas

128
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,700
will get incinerated
with his wrath!

129
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,440
What do I offer
great sage Durvasa now?

130
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,500
What do I do now?

131
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,510
The curse of great sage Durvasa

132
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,600
has the power to turn all our
plans upside down, My Lord.

133
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,470
What will become of us now?

134
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,570
Disciple...

135
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,530
I do not think we will get
a meal from this residence.

136
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,570
Let's leave!

137
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,570
No, great sage.
No.

138
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,440
Just wait for
a little while longer.

139
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Panchali!

140
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,470
Brother Yudhishthir,
the great sage is very angry.

141
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,440
He is about to leave
on an empty stomach.

142
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,410
The duties of a householder have
been tarnished by Pandu's sons!

143
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,340
I cannot wait any longer.

144
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,410
Let's leave!

145
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,440
Just a little while longer,
great sage.

146
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,370
Just wait for
a little while longer.

147
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Insolent men!

148
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Do you not know

149
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,470
that the longer hunger
and the enemies wait

150
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,340
the stronger they get?!

151
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,370
They become more powerful!

152
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,510
Get up!

153
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,530
Patience and herbs

154
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,570
become weaker
with the passage of time!

155
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,340
And listen!

156
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,600
I shall wait only until I am
done reciting the Gayatri Mantra

157
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,340
101 times and
not a moment longer!

158
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,510
Not a moment longer!

159
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,440
Why is he testing us
in this manner?

160
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,540
This exile is a time of tests
for all of us, Panchali.

161
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,570
In order to help us
know our limits

162
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
the Almighty has blessed us with
this opportunity of an exile.

163
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,410
I have realized what
my limits are, My Lord.

164
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,480
I lack in providing nourishment.

165
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,410
I shall go to the great sage

166
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,310
and apologize for this.

167
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,510
Stop, Panchali.

168
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,410
If the great sage
vents his anger out on you

169
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,280
then it would be a defeat
for us five brothers.

170
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,370
Wait here.

171
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,270
I shall go tell him.
- Stop, Sahadev.

172
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,340
Panchali lacking grains
in her kitchen

173
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,400
denotes my limit.

174
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,500
You need not worry,
Panchali.

175
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,370
Ensuring that one has enough
grains for a guest at home

176
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
is the duty of a householder.

177
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,500
It is my defeat
as a householder.

178
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,240
That is why, I must
apologize to the great sage.

179
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,200
Whenever one undergoes a test

180
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,880
there is always a way

181
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
to succeed in it.

182
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,310
How do I succeed in this?

183
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,270
How are you,
friend?

184
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Are you happy?

185
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,270
Govind!

186
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,250
How do you do it,
Govind?

187
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,280
Whenever I require your aid

188
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,380
you always come to me.

189
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,380
Aid!

190
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,420
This is a deliberate attempt
on your part, friend.

191
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,420
Whenever I come visit all of you

192
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,320
you always make me do
some task or the other.

193
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,470
What seems to be the problem?

194
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,480
Great sage Durvasa
and his disciples

195
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,310
have come over for a meal

196
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,450
but there is no food
in any of the vessels.

197
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,320
Let me think of a way

198
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,220
to make the great sage
understand.

199
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,220
This is a grave problem.

200
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,340
A grain of rice
is still there, friend.

201
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,380
However, this single
grain of rice

202
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,180
would not leave
those sages contented.

203
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,380
Am I correct?

204
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,340
How would it,
Govind?

205
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,150
I think great sage Durvasa
is almost done

206
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,250
reciting the mantra as well.

207
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,320
Govind, I will have to serve him
and the 100 disciples of his

208
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,370
a meal very soon.

209
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
In such a situation

210
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,210
saving this single grain

211
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,190
for them is of no use.

212
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,370
Let me have it.

213
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,220
'Om Bhur Bhuvah...'

214
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,220
Prince Bheem!

215
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,210
I am certain that the
treacherous Vasudev Krishna

216
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,050
is inside your hut.

217
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,150
Pardon me,
great sage Durvasa.

218
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,280
Why have I done,
great sage?

219
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,410
Why have I done,
great sage?

220
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
You are an illusory being,
Vasudev

221
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,380
but the person
you have sided with

222
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,210
is on the side of righteousness

223
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,250
and there is no doubt about it.

224
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,140
And

225
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,350
the daughter of Drupad

226
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,410
we are leaving your home
feeling contented.

227
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,150
You have

228
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,210
truly been blessed by Goddess Annapurna.*
*Annapurna Devi: the goddess of nourishment.

229
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,140
You are too kind,
great sage.

230
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,340
Great sage Durvasa
and his disciples

231
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,250
burped as though
they had just eaten.

232
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,340
The courage to cast an illusion
on great sage Durvasa

233
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,410
can reside only
within you, Vasudev.

234
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,280
What did I do?

235
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,180
The son of Pavan Dev,
Lord Hanuman

236
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,210
was pleased by brother Bheem.

237
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,240
I believe

238
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,340
that the great sage burped

239
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,340
because of something
that brother Bheem did.

240
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,350
Will you come
to aid us again, Govind?

241
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,110
Indeed

242
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,080
but

243
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,340
I will not be able
to aid all of you

244
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,150
in the place where
you must go now.
