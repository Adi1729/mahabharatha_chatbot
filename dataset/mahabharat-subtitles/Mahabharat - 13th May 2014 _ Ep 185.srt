1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,240
Vishnu, who blesses
the whole universe

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,520
requests for your blessings.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,880
Accept me as your son, mother.

4
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,560
I am taking my son to Gokul.

5
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,360
He will be safe
under the protection

6
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
of my friend Nand.
- But...

7
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
But how, Your Highness?

8
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,320
The prison gates are locked.

9
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,000
A battalion of soldiers
is standing outside.

10
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,240
It is raining so heavily.

11
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,320
The River Yamuna
must have flooded.

12
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,080
Under such circumstances,
how will we take

13
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,320
our new born son
to Gokul?

14
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
No, Your Highness. No!

15
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,880
Who can stop the Almighty,
Devaki?

16
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,200
Bless your son.

17
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,880
What a terrible night,
Vasudev!

18
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Yes, my friend Nand.

19
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,560
It is the most terrible night
of my life

20
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,280
when I am asking my friend
for such a great sacrifice.

21
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,880
You are not asking me for it,
Vasudev.

22
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,800
It is time, which is asking
for the sacrifice.

23
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,400
Before the sun rises

24
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,840
every night seems
to be extremely dark.

25
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,960
But the sun definitely rises.

26
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,480
My wife Yashoda

27
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,440
has given birth
to our daughter tonight.

28
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
Take her with you

29
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
and hand your son over,
under my protection.

30
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,360
Please reconsider, Nand.

31
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,440
Possibly, Kans will kill
your daughter.

32
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,760
In that case,

33
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,440
the whole universe would be
beholden to my daughter.

34
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,440
Here, Vasudev.
Take her with you.

35
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,680
Vasudev.
Take her with you.

36
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,880
Your Highness, a boy
has been born.

37
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,320
She is my friend Nand's
daughter.

38
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
Daughter, Your Highness?

39
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,720
In that case, brother will
not kill her, will he?

40
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,960
Devaki! Where is
your eight offspring?

41
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Your son. My nemesis!
Where is he?

42
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,960
No, brother. It's not a son.

43
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,080
I have given birth
to a daughter.

44
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,780
No, brother. It's not a son.

45
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,700
I have given birth
to a daughter.

46
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,300
Daughter!

47
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,260
How is that possible?

48
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,220
Your eighth child

49
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
your son will be
the cause of my death.

50
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,460
That was the prophecy.

51
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,900
How did you give birth
to a daughter?

52
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,380
How is this possible?

53
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,500
I had told you
to ignore the prophecy

54
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,900
and refrain from committing
this sin.

55
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,300
You have committed the sin

56
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,180
of killing six infants,
Your Highness.

57
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,340
God wants to show you
the right path.

58
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,420
Hence, Devaki's seventh child
was not born

59
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,260
and the eighth child
is a daughter.

60
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,860
Give me your daughter,
Devaki.

61
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
No, brother!

62
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,620
Do not be so stone-hearted.

63
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,660
What could my daughter
possibly do to you?

64
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,540
Spare the life of at least
one of my children.

65
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,180
Have mercy!

66
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,620
Foolish Devaki

67
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,740
had I not promised Vasudev

68
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,740
I would have killed you too,
at this very moment.

69
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,340
I can't spare the life
of your eighth child.

70
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,900
No matter if it is
a boy or a girl

71
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,340
I have to kill it!

72
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,420
Give me the child!
- No, let her go.

73
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,220
Let her go.
- Let me go!

74
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,820
No... Brother, she is innocent.

75
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,660
Let her go.
- Devaki's eight child...

76
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,180
Brother, let her go.
- You are my nemesis.

77
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,940
No...
- Brother!

78
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,260
Let me go! No!

79
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,940
Now, the prophecy
will be proven wrong.

80
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,540
No! No...

81
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,580
Brother... Let my daughter go.

82
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,620
Let her go!
Brother! Brother!

83
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,100
Brother, no.
Let my daughter go.

84
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,140
Let her go! No!

85
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,380
No!
- Brother!

86
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Enemy of the Yadav clan, Kans

87
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,700
your wickedness has crossed
all boundaries.

88
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,740
But don't forget.

89
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,860
The moon does get eclipsed.

90
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,060
But the eclipse doesn't last

91
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,940
for very long.

92
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,180
Even you will not live
for much longer.

93
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,060
The boy who will punish you
is safe.

94
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,820
And at the right time,
he will slay you.

95
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,620
The boy who will punish you
is safe.

96
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,620
And at the right time,
he will slay you.

97
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,740
Did Yogmaya* once again merge with Vishnu, uncle?
*Goddess Yogmaya, the sister of Krishna.

98
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,900
No, Abhimanyu.

99
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,700
To establish lawfulness,
Lord Vishnu's Yogmaya

100
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,700
keeps manifesting herself.

101
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,940
Sometimes in the form of power,
sometimes, devotion

102
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,900
and sometimes,
as a person.

103
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,860
How did you make
this miracle take place

104
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,220
as soon as you were born, uncle?

105
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,140
Sutsom, being
born as a mortal

106
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,420
cannot perform miracles.

107
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,940
One who is born
of a woman's womb

108
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,900
is bound by the rules
of a mortal body.

109
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,620
He cannot escape
birth, old age

110
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,580
disease and death.

111
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,580
But a miracle
did take place, uncle.

112
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,620
It definitely did, Satanik.

113
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,060
But that miracle
was performed by God.

114
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,140
When every person heartily feels
the need to put an end

115
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,300
to anarchy and establish
a lawful society...

116
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,500
When sin crosses
every boundary...

117
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,820
Then

118
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,780
God performs miracles
to protect morality.

119
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,340
To establish lawfulness,
when a person

120
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,580
gives up his selfishness
and attachment

121
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,700
and becomes ready to sacrifice

122
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,260
the whole creation gets filled
with miracles.

123
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,340
Because of the sacrifices
made by my mothers

124
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,100
Devaki and Yashoda

125
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,060
a miracle took place
in that prison, dear.

126
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,620
This is the balance of creation.

127
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,860
But God only performs miracles

128
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,260
when there is unlawfulness
all around

129
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,060
yet, lawfulness resides
in the people's hearts.

130
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,060
So that human beings
never fear struggle.

131
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,140
Whenever a person

132
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,260
battles sin even with
his last iota of power

133
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,780
God performs miracles
to protect him.

134
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,220
Even during the dice game

135
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,020
the Pandavas were subjected
to a lot of injustice.

136
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,500
But they never resorted
to unlawfulness.

137
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,380
Even after so much humiliation,
pain and oppression

138
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,820
your mother
did not accept defeat.

139
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,940
That's why, God performed
a miracle.

140
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,500
This means that if you wish

141
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,460
to seek help from the universe
this creation and God

142
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,820
then first of all

143
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,380
give up your selfishness
and attachment

144
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,220
and learn to fight
against the circumstances!

145
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,900
Am I not right, my friend?
