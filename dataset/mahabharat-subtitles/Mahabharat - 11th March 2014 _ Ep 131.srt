1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,710
'A while later.'

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,790
Uncle

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,740
what are you rejoicing over?

4
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,640
The Serpent King Takshak
got defeated

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,730
the cows reached Indraprastha

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,730
and even the reverence
of the city took place!

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,470
Very soon, they shall perform
the Rajsuya 'Yajna,' uncle.

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,470
Are you rejoicing
over this, uncle?

9
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,530
Uncle

10
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,500
this time,
your political games...

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,510
Were a success,
my darlings!

12
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,700
They were a success!

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,660
The Serpent King Takshak
may have been defeated

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,700
but the victory is ours.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,740
Until Arjun completes
his penance and returns

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,470
the Pandavas

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,530
will not be able to conduct
the Rajsuya 'Yajna.'

18
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,600
The opportunity to stop
the Rajsuya 'Yajna'

19
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,640
is finally in our hands,
my darlings.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,540
It is finally in our hands!

21
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,630
But uncle

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,430
how will we stop them?

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
Listen.

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,630
There are two great forces
in the Aryan region.

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,470
The Yadavas of Dwaraka

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,630
and Jarasandha of Magadha.

27
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,460
Both of them are enemies.

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,510
The strength of the Pandavas
are the Yadavas

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
because Krishna
is on their side.

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,490
If

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,440
the Yadavas

32
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,630
decide to help us

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,390
then the Pandavas

34
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,500
will never be able to conduct
the Rajsuya 'Yajna.'

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,530
And Jarasandha

36
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,400
is an unrighteous man!

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,470
The Pandavas

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,570
will never be an ally
to Jarasandha!

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,370
But uncle

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,400
we have got the news

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,570
that Arjun and
the Princess of Manipur

42
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,390
Chitrangada have got married.

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,630
Uh!

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,540
And the Serpent King
Kauravya's daughter

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,630
Ulupi has also been
married to him.

46
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,370
In other words,
even Arjun

47
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,530
is getting married to magnify
his strength, uncle.

48
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,340
My darling,
do not worry about that.

49
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,600
Even with the aid of
the King of Manipur

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,400
and the Serpent King Kauravya

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,600
Indraprastha cannot become
a powerful kingdom.

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,570
The key element here
are the Yadavas.

53
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,340
But the Yadavas will
never side with us, uncle.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,460
They will.

55
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,440
The leader of the Yadavas

56
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,340
is Krishna

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,460
and Krishna

58
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,430
never disobeys

59
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,500
his elder brother Balaram.

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,400
It is time now

61
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,440
to approach Balaram

62
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,340
and form an ally with him.

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,500
Very soon

64
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,460
we shall leave for Dwaraka
for this purpose.

65
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,370
You must become
Balaram's disciple.

66
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,500
You must learn the art of
fighting with a mace from him

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,270
and become a darling of his.

68
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,460
You will be married

69
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,500
to Balaram's beloved sister

70
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,270
Subhadra, my darling.

71
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,230
In the meantime

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Arjun will be engrossed
in his penance

73
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,370
in the jungles
of the Aryan region

74
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,340
and wandering about aimlessly!

75
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,270
An arrow is formed
not with the aid of mantras

76
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,300
but with that
of one's heart, friend.

77
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,460
You must calm your heart down.

78
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,260
How do I calm
my heart down, Govind?

79
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,430
My Lord is travelling
by himself.

80
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,300
Neither does he have
domestic help nor security.

81
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,210
He is not wearing anything
on his feet either.

82
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,200
In this austere penance of his

83
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,370
who will take care of his needs?

84
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,400
And I cannot stop thinking
about this, Govind.

85
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,430
Worry is the most definitive
form of love, friend.

86
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,170
You are worried for Arjun
and that is no surprise.

87
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,140
But when I think about Arjun

88
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,240
I feel as though I am...

89
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,240
I am being unjust

90
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,230
to the rest of my husbands.

91
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,210
I am failing to adhere
to my oath, Govind.

92
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,130
This is a dreadful situation.

93
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,300
Perhaps, Sahadev should have
entered your chamber

94
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,300
to get the Gandiva Bow.

95
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,240
Then Arjun would not have to...

96
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,330
What are you saying, Govind?

97
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,240
Then Sahadev would have
had to leave the city.

98
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,330
How would I have been
able to bear that?

99
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,200
Then Bheem and Nakul...
- No!

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,170
Staying away from any of my
beloved family members

101
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,300
is unbearable for me, Govind.

102
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,360
Staying away from

103
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,130
your loved ones.

104
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,200
That sentence can be divided
into two parts, friend.

105
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,100
The first deals with distance

106
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,200
and the other with...

107
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,140
Love?

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,300
Yes!
Love .

109
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,100
In other words

110
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,170
the distance between two people

111
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,200
is not measured
by physical proximity

112
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,240
but by the depth of one's love.

113
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,270
You must calm
your heart down, friend.

114
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,090
You are not being
unjust to anyone.

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,230
Each of the Pandavas

116
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,190
is equally dear to you.

117
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,170
The benefits of Arjun's penance

118
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,200
will be reaped not only by him

119
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,070
but also by the entire
Kuru dynasty, friend.

120
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,260
You must be patient.

121
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,100
When you receive news
that may question your faith

122
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,130
you must remember

123
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,040
that time does not take
the path made by man.

124
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,070
Man must walk on the path
illuminated by time.

125
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,100
This is called fate.

126
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,190
So, will My Lord meet
with some danger, Govind?

127
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,060
How would I know that, friend?

128
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,070
You are able to see
the future, Govind.

129
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,130
I do not see the future, friend.

130
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,190
I only see man

131
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,200
and understand his nature.

132
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,060
The nature of a man
builds his future.

133
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,040
That is why, I am able to see
his future to an extent.

134
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,230
I do not know if danger
will befall Arjun or not

135
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,940
but I certainly know

136
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,160
that even in danger

137
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,090
he will see an opportunity.

138
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,970
That is why, there is no reason
to worry for Arjun, friend.

139
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,170
You must learn
to be patient, friend.

140
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,970
How can I be patient, Govind?

141
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,130
By making yourself believe

142
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,200
that no matter where any of your
family members is travelling

143
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,130
he is always near you

144
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
and in your loving heart.

145
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,900
Only still waters can
reflect an image, friend.

146
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,160
If you calm your heart down

147
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,000
then you will be able
to see Arjun in it.

148
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,180
Madhav

149
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,310
you had asked me to come
to the Somnath temple

150
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,070
to complete my penance.

151
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,180
So, here I am.

152
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,180
Prince Duryodhan,
this is the place

153
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,080
where Lord Shiva had freed
Chandra Dev from his curse.

154
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,040
Ever since, we have been deemed
the descendants of Chandra Dev

155
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,140
while we deem
Lord Somnath our Deity.

156
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,010
Here in Dwaraka,
all tasks

157
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,170
take place methodically
and ritualistically.

158
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,000
This way,
King of Gandhar!

159
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,970
The veneration of Lord Shiva

160
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,140
will be conducted first by you.

161
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,200
Why are you
embarrassing me, Vasudev?

162
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,700
High up in the sky

163
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,740
in the region of Garuda*
*A large mythical bird, or humanoid bird. Garuda is the mount (vahana) of Vishnu (Krishna).

164
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,010
no vulture can ever fly.

165
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,110
And I had been named
by my revered father

166
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,950
King Subala.
Shakuni

167
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,070
in other words
a vulture.

168
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,940
So, how can I perform
the veneration before you?

169
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,000
Why can you not,
King of Gandhar?

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,560
By having Duryodhan
and Subhadra married

171
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,950
the idea of forming an alliance
between the Kurus and Yadavas

172
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,000
was yours, was it not?

173
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,910
In other words

174
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,540
a vulture can now venture
in the region of Garuda

175
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,620
quite freely.

176
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,160
King of Gandhar

177
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,320
will you not pay your respects
to the sages present here?

178
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,520
I have heard

179
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,810
that paying one's respects
to Lord Shiva's devotees

180
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,110
makes Lord Shiva happier.

181
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,970
Certainly.

182
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,160
Vasudev Krishna!

183
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,330
This is the only man

184
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,390
who spoils all our plans.

185
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,270
When Balram proposed your name
to marry Subhadra

186
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,290
though he expressed
his happiness

187
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,170
yet I doubt him.

188
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,330
He is definitely brewing up
some plan

189
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,220
otherwise at such critical time

190
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,230
Arjun would never
have been at Somnath.

191
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,360
What game this man is playing

192
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,200
is completely beyond me.

193
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,260
I think it's called 'Lagori'.*
*Seven stones.

194
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,130
If you have put your mind
on hold, my dear

195
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,220
give some rest
to your tongue as well.

196
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,220
Why are you so worried

197
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,070
for Arjun's presence over here,
uncle?

198
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,100
Now he can't interrupt
my wedding.

199
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,220
If he abducts Subhadra

200
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,060
he would have to fight

201
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,260
Vasudev and Balram.

202
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
And Arjun

203
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,100
will never raise arms

204
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,090
against Vasudev and Balram,
uncle.

205
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,130
You are really not aware

206
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,130
of the true colours
of Vasudev Krishna.

207
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,190
The spider never eats
without knitting the cobweb.

208
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,190
Krishna's act without planning...

209
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,160
That's not possible.

210
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,230
He has got
a very dangerous mind.
