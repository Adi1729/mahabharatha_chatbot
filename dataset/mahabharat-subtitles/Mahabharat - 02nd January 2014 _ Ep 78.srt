1
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,040
A message from
the King of Gandhar?

2
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,200
Purandiri, the King of Gandhar
has sent a message.

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,130
We must set the palace
on fire tonight itself.

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,170
Then...

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
Yes, we will have to poison
their meal tonight itself.

6
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,970
If they are alive

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,940
they might escape easily when
they see the palace on fire.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,170
Bring the vessel of poison
I gave to you at once.

9
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,000
Certainly, My Lord.

10
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,870
Purochan!

11
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,010
What...
What is it, Prince?

12
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,900
What are all of you doing?

13
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,010
W- We are...

14
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,900
We are preparing tonight's meal.

15
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,940
Y- Yes.

16
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,840
It is way past dinner time.

17
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,830
Are you not done with it yet?

18
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,030
Indeed, Prince. We shall
serve the meal right away.

19
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,070
Do proceed to
the dining chamber.

20
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,800
You do not follow any order
given to you, Purochan.

21
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,900
W- What, Prince?

22
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,910
We had told you to construct a
dining chamber inside the palace

23
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,840
but you have not yet
paid heed to it.

24
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,930
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake, Prince.

25
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,910
I shall have one made
tomorrow without fail.

26
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,860
Brother Bheem, wait.

27
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,760
Let us take some 'kheer'

28
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,700
for Nakul's mouse

29
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,740
otherwise he will bring it
with him to the dining chamber

30
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,740
and mother will be unable
to have her meal.

31
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,830
That's a splendid idea.

32
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,740
Bring a small bowl, Purochan.

33
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,700
Purochan!

34
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,740
Bring a small bowl!
We want some 'kheer...'

35
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,890
T- That...

36
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,760
What is that substance
on the 'kheer?'

37
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,760
Herbs. - Potion...
- Syrup.

38
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,740
In other words

39
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,770
it is a syrup made
from selected flowers.

40
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,540
It has an odd smell.

41
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,640
It is excellent
for digestion, Prince.

42
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,540
That is why, it is used
in preparing 'kheer.'

43
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,610
The meal shall not
have an odd smell, Prince.

44
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,760
Not one bit.

45
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,770
Alright. Make sure the taste
is not compromised.

46
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,730
Certainly.

47
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Brother Bheem

48
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,740
you forgot to take the 'kheer.'
- Oh yes.

49
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,700
Purochan, bring some 'kheer'
in a small bowl.

50
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,570
Certainly, Prince.

51
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,700
Purandiri.
- What?

52
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,690
Certainly.

53
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,730
Here you go.

54
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,710
But father, what if the Pandavas
don't eat the 'kheer' themselves

55
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,630
but feed it to
the mouse instead?

56
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,630
It will die.

57
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,600
What happened?
Why do you seem so tense?

58
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,600
Are you famished like me?

59
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,670
No, brother Bheem.

60
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,590
No other person can ever
have an appetite like yours.

61
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,610
But... But something

62
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,390
ominous is going to happen.

63
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,440
I have such a premonition.

64
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,610
Purochan's wife
prepares the meals.

65
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,410
It is bound to be ominous.

66
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,400
Who knows what she adds
to the meals.

67
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,470
I feel, Purochan's entire
family is ominous.

68
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,430
He has constructed
such a strange palace.

69
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,630
It looks stunning

70
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,500
but the entire palace
reeks of something.

71
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,630
We should ask Purochan about it.

72
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,630
But only after having our meal.

73
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,430
Once I see food,
I cannot control myself.

74
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,410
Go on. Go and call brother
Yudhishthir, Arjun and Nakul.

75
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,540
And if you do not reach on time,
I shall begin eating.

76
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,370
Certainly, brother.
You may begin eating.

77
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,440
Besides, you eat
for three hours.

78
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,560
And we end up
just sitting there with you.

79
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,400
Go on.

80
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,300
Purochan.

81
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,400
What is it, Prince? - If you
keep standing at the door

82
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,300
you will turn into a festoon
hung over doorways.

83
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,410
Come on. Make haste.
Serve the meal.

84
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,560
But Prince, the Crown Prince and
Her Highness are not yet here.

85
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,570
They will be here.
Just serve the meal.

86
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,300
Prince, do pardon me.

87
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,530
How can you begin eating
without Her Highness?

88
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,500
She has ordered me
to begin eating without her.

89
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
But Prince, we have prepared
quite a feast today.

90
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,270
If you eat with your family,
it will give us great joy.

91
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,240
Give me that.

92
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,270
I will eat not only with her
but also after she is done.

93
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,950
Place the other vessels
over there. - Certainly, Prince.

94
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Let's go.

95
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,960
Mother!
Brother Yudhishthir!

96
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,720
I am awaiting for all of you!

97
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,950
They ought to begin
eating together, My Lord.

98
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,660
If he begins eating
before the others arrive

99
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,660
the poison will start
showing its effect on him

100
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,650
and our plan will be foiled.

101
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,820
Stop him from eating, My Lord.

102
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
But how do I stop him?

103
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,820
How odd!

104
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,690
Every animal feels calm
in my presence

105
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,810
but why is it so restless?

106
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,620
Nakul
maybe your mouse is hungry.

107
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,690
Here is some 'kheer' for it.

108
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,880
Brother Arjun, mother is
awaiting us for the meal.

109
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,750
Why? Will brother Bheem
not wait for us?

110
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,710
Nakul

111
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,760
do come for dinner
after feeding your mouse.

112
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,760
But it refuses to eat.
- How odd!

113
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,590
Where do you wish to go, mouse?

114
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,590
Maybe it is anxious to fulfill

115
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,790
the task it came here for.

116
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,590
Then we will know why
uncle Vidur sent us a mouse.

117
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,650
Nakul, let it go.
Let's see where it goes.

118
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,490
What is it, brother Arjun?

119
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,590
Lac has been used instead
of bricks in the palace.

120
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,710
Lac has been used instead
of bricks in the palace.

121
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,770
Why has this palace been
constructed this way, brother?

122
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,900
You may not know this, Nakul

123
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,640
but lac is extremely flammable.

124
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,840
Along with lac,
this palace is made

125
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,840
with dried grass,
clarified butter and cotton.

126
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,870
If this palace catches fire

127
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,840
everything will get burnt
within six hours.

128
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,800
But why?

129
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,840
This is a conspiracy.

130
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,610
Greetings, Her Highness.

131
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,700
Bless you.

132
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,800
Greetings, mother.
- Bless you, Bheem.

133
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,740
Where is Yudhishthir
and the rest of your brothers?

134
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,770
Mother, instead of
having a meal with me

135
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,570
my brothers find feeding
a mouse more interesting.

136
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,740
Bheem, you may begin eating.
I shall await for the rest.

137
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,670
Alright, mother.

138
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Father

139
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,700
the remaining Pandavas
have figured out

140
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,610
that the entire palace
is made of lac.

141
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,700
This is a scheme to burn
us alive in the palace.
