1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,060
Sacrifice and truth

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,090
run through the veins of this dynasty.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
With all due respect, Your Highness

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,080
in order to avenge the insult

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,060
my husband and children are ready to take weapon in the war.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,060
I have the right to ask this question.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,050
So that everybody is going to fight for you
without selfish motives in mind.

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,040
Wait.

9
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,050
I'll greet them first, My Lord.

10
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,920
Before you come in, give me an answer,

11
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,940
who you really are?

12
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,920
Panchali,

13
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,960
he is the sister-in-law Subhadra's son

14
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,960
Abhimanyu.

15
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,890
I know his name, My Lord.

16
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,950
I even know what is his relation to us.

17
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,920
But I want to know who is he truly is?

18
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,910
Sister-in-law!

19
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,890
Son Abhimanyu.

20
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,920
Panchali do not ask what all people know.

21
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,890
There are various types of clouds.

22
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,920
Some drift without producing rain.

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,860
Some carry flood.

24
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,920
Some bring beautiful bath.

25
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,920
While some just rumble.

26
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,890
Who you really are Abhimanyu?

27
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,860
Tell that to mother.

28
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,860
I...

29
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,860
I am my father arrows.

30
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,860
I need a blood bath.

31
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,860
But the glory will go to my father.

32
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,890
I shield my brothers.

33
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,860
I will stand in front of them at the moment of struggle.

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
And behind them in peace time.

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,820
But above all,

36
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,850
above all, I am kohl* for the eyes of Mother Panchali,
*Ancient eye cosmetic, traditionally made by grinding galena (lead sulfide) and other ingredients.

37
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,850
Each time there are tears in those eyes,

38
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,860
I could wipe the entire existense.

39
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,750
These are my tears,

40
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,780
Queen Mother, do you want me to die before...

41
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,760
Why you, Subhadra.

42
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,720
Why you

43
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,720
gave birth to such a child?

44
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,760
Gems may be born out of sister-in-law's story

45
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,750
but it is intended to be ornament of the Empress.

46
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,720
He is your son.

47
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,760
He is surely mine.

48
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,690
And until the end of time

49
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,690
the child's name will be immortalized!

50
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,370
New era

51
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,430
always begins with the destruction, Majesty.

52
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,410
The alignment of heavenly bodies

53
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,410
indicates the major changes.

54
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,370
Every war causes great destruction.

55
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,370
Tell me what will be destroyed.

56
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,390
What will happen to my children?

57
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,370
Majesty, try to remember the story of Matsya* avatar.
*Matsya ("Fish") is the first avatar of Vishnu that rescued the first man, Manu.

58
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,410
When the Almighty has submerged the entire
world in water.

59
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,340
Who have seeked refuge
to the Almighty?

60
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,340
As a result, only he is still alive.

61
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,370
Similarly, even in this war

62
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,340
people who are destined to
be destroyed

63
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,630
are those who has not been in the path 
of refuge in the Almighty.

64
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,360
If your children,

65
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,310
have left the Almighty,

66
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,370
and embraced luxury.

67
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,360
Then they are bound to be destroyed, Majesty.

68
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,360
But there is no deficit of competence on my side,

69
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,340
Great Sage.

70
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,310
His Majesty Bisma, great teacher Dorna,

71
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,310
and because maharathi Karna is a great warrior

72
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,330
who will keep my sons safe on the battlefield.

73
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,330
Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn

74
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,310
Rahu, Ketu,* Sun and Moon
*Rahu is a severed head of an asura, that swallows the sun causing eclipses. Ketu is said to be the body of Rahu, after the head of the asura was cut off by Vishnu.

75
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,270
are much stronger

76
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,290
than any warriors from each side, Majesty.

77
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,330
When it's time for someone to die

78
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,330
no man can keep it from him.

79
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,270
However, you may

80
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,290
strengthen your heart.

81
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,300
Survive the blow, Majesty.

82
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,300
That's all.

83
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,290
What do you mean?

84
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,300
Are all my children

85
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,240
will die in the war?

86
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,330
The entire Kuru dynasty will disappear,

87
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,240
only those people will live,

88
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,300
which has the protection of the Almighty.

89
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,240
Which have the protection of the Most Powerful?

90
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,240
Answer me, O' Great Sage.

91
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,240
Do my children

92
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,240
do not have the protection of the Most Powerful?

93
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,290
It has been so

94
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,260
to my fear and worry

95
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,240
but do not let it weighed you down, Majesty.

96
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,270
My children...

97
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,210
will die...

98
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,210
No...

99
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,210
Why did Great Sage Vyas has given life to my children?

100
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,170
There must be a way

101
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,170
to keep my children alive, O' Great Sage!

102
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,170
You have

103
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,230
the power to save a son.

104
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,170
You can save any of your sons' life, Majesty.

105
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,210
One son!

106
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,130
God has blessed me with a hundred sons.

107
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,170
A hundred children.

108
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,100
They were supposed to build my husband's empire.

109
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,140
And you say

110
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,160
that

111
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,130
I could only keep one of them living.

112
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,160
Your Excellency, it is also not an easy task

113
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,130
however

114
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,140
there are ways

115
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,090
using one of which, an heir to a Kuru dynasty

116
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,140
can stay alive.

117
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,070
Who can stay alive?

118
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,070
Who can I give a ride to?

119
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,100
How do I...

120
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,070
This is your decision to choose.

121
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,090
Do you want him to stay alive, Majesty?

122
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,040
You have to think of ways

123
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,110
to keep the child alive.

124
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,540
I can not even say

125
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,790
if this arrangement will benefit your children,

126
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,760
or Kunti's side.

127
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,760
All I can say is

128
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,810
that only one lamp of the Kuru dynasty 
that will continues to burn.

129
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,750
Remember

130
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,780
the burning of lights at the foot of the Almighty

131
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,720
is one of the beneficial.

132
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,780
Kuru dynasty would disappear

133
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,760
only those people will live

134
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,760
who have protection from the Almighty.

135
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,760
I can not even say

136
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,750
if this arrangement

137
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,720
will benefit your children

138
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,740
or Kunti's side.

139
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,720
The burning of lights at the foot of the Almighty

140
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,720
is one of the beneficial.

141
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,620
Queen Sudeshna

142
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,590
even in all regions of the Aryan

143
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,590
you do not find a decent young man

144
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,650
for such a beautiful girl?

145
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,620
We will arrange a Swayamvar

146
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,620
for this year Vasudev.

147
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,590
But you have declared war.

148
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,650
Who knows how many princes

149
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,620
who will live until the end of the war.

150
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,560
So how do we

151
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,620
have Uttara married before the war?

152
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,550
Being recorded for the alignment of the object 
of the heavenly bodies.

153
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,610
We still have some time before
war begins.

154
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,580
We still have four months with us,
Queen Sudeshna.

155
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,560
But how can that be Swayamvar
held in just four months?

156
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,610
What needs to arrange a Swayamvar?

157
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,610
Here, there Uttara herself

158
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,580
and even the groom.

159
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,580
There you go.

160
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,520
It is a Swayamvar.

161
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,520
King Virat,

162
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,520
if you think it's alright,

163
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,460
shouldn't we marry Uttara and Abhimanyu

164
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,490
at the earliest possible?

165
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,510
In Abhimanyu

166
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,510
running blood from both the Kurus and Yadavas.

167
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,460
And Uttara

168
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,420
is the great Matsya dynasty descendant.

169
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,480
Their marriage

170
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,460
will merge

171
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,480
the three major dynasties, King Virat.

172
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,450
Impossible!

173
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,460
Your Majesty, how can you

174
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,460
make such a major decision without
discussing it first with me?

175
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,420
Sudeshna, this is Uttara's good fortune

176
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,450
that she will become daughter-in-law of Pandu's sons.

177
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,390
She will be Krishna student's wife.

178
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,410
Abhimanyu is a great warrior.

179
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,450
Kshatriya's daughters are married in a Swayamvar, Majesty.

180
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,390
Don't let the war ruin everything.

181
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,450
What if Pandu's sons defeated in this war?

182
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,390
How about the future of our Uttara?

183
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,420
Queen Sudeshna

184
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,360
do you have a firm conviction

185
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,410
that you can shape the future of Uttara

186
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,410
in accordance to your plan?

187
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,410
Do you

188
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,410
have a certain right to time?

189
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm sorry, Vasudev.

190
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,410
But even you

191
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,360
do not have right to time.

192
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,380
Of course

193
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,380
I have

194
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,390
no right to time.

195
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,360
However, I have faith

196
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,360
in the generosity of time.

197
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,360
I promise you, Queen Sudeshna

198
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,320
that Uttara would give birth 

199
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,310
to the greatest empire of the entire nation.

200
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,290
Abhimanyu

201
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,290
will become the one to usher in a new era.

202
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,290
While his son

203
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,290
will begin the first phase in the transformation.

204
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,290
Your daughter Uttara

205
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,290
would take away the whole Aryan region out of war

206
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,290
to peace and tranquility.
