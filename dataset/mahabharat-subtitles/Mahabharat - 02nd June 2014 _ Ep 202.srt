1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,130
Pardon me, dear

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,120
but if the Kauravas win

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,570
then the entire society
will meet with misfortune

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,580
and establishing righteousness
will become impossible.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
And

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
in the path to defeating
the Kauravas

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,470
you are acting as a fortress.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,410
If you take an oath
to back out from this war

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,380
then I can release you

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,600
from the promise you made.

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,500
The decision is yours.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,380
Either back out from this war

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,530
or give up the protection
of your armour.

14
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,230
Do accept the charity,
Lord Indra.

15
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,940
For the sake
of your son's victory

16
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,100
you had to engage

17
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,170
in such a grave deception
with me, Lord Indra.

18
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,070
The mere sight of this

19
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,980
gives me the joy of victory.

20
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,940
What have you done,
Lord Indra?!

21
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,040
You asked for the armour and
ear-rings of King Karna of Anga!

22
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,130
Yes, Arjun.

23
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,940
Now, there will be no obstacle
in the path to your victory.

24
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,970
But how could you act
so unjustly, father?!

25
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,900
By rendering my enemy weak

26
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
you have rendered me
weak as well.

27
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,010
If there is no challenge

28
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,970
then how can there be
an increase in one's strength?

29
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,880
The trees that grow on rocks
are very strong, Lord Indra.

30
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,000
But the stem of a lotus
growing in a pond

31
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,810
is not strong.

32
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,810
Today, you have tainted
my reputation, Lord Indra.

33
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,910
The severed thumb of Ekalavya

34
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,000
weighs my spirit down
even to this day.

35
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,870
Even today, whenever someone
appreciates my archery

36
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,030
I am reminded of Ekalavya.

37
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,870
I begin to doubt

38
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,880
that had Ekalavya
not sacrificed his thumb

39
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,810
would he have been
stronger than me?

40
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,770
Because of
Ekalavya's severed thumb

41
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,930
my competence has been
gravely tainted, father.

42
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,870
By asking for the armour and
ear-rings of King Karna of Anga

43
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,770
you have tainted
my reputation further, father.

44
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Because of me

45
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,740
you inflicted such agony
on the King of Anga.

46
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Did

47
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,800
you not have faith
in the competence of your son?

48
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,970
Did you not have faith
in his Gandiva?

49
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,870
Or did you not have faith
in your own blessing, father?

50
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,740
The question is not about
your competence, Arjun.

51
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,000
Karna's armour

52
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,840
was not a celestial weapon

53
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,870
bestowed by a God.

54
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,770
It was a part
of Surya Dev himself.

55
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,970
After his birth

56
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,910
Karna was Messed with it.

57
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,940
It was necessary
to have it removed.

58
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,900
In a war of humans

59
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,870
no part of a God
can ever take part in it.

60
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,870
Neither for protection

61
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,970
nor attack.

62
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,910
That is why, Lord Hanuman
shall be present on your flag

63
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,710
and not in your chariot.

64
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,780
But you have cursed me,
father!

65
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,780
I could have slain
King Karna of Anga

66
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,970
with the presence of his
armour and ear-rings.

67
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,710
However,
as I have taken an oath

68
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,840
I will still slay
King Karna of Anga!

69
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
However 

70
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,980
by asking for the armour and
ear-rings of the King of Anga

71
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,860
you...

72
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,080
You have snatched the joy
of victory from me, father.

73
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,030
People will say

74
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,940
that only because of
the weakness of my enemy

75
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,980
did I gain victory.

76
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,970
My victory

77
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,770
has been turned into
an insult by you, father.

78
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,970
Now, please have
mercy on your son

79
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,810
and return the King of Anga
his armour and ear-rings!

80
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,000
That is impossible,
Arjun.

81
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,800
King Karna of Anga

82
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,810
will never take back anything
he gave away as charity.

83
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,930
However, I am willing
to give you a boon.

84
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,840
Go ahead,
dear Karna.

85
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,970
Ask me for a boon.

86
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,000
I have engaged in charity,
Lord Indra.

87
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,740
I have not engaged
in a business dealing.

88
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,910
If I grace someone
with my presence

89
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,840
and give him nothing in return

90
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,000
then it would taint
my reputation.

91
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,700
Go ahead.

92
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,880
Ask for anything you like,
dear

93
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,880
To a warrior,
the greatest boon

94
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,710
is his weapon.

95
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,870
If you are so intent on giving

96
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,840
then give me a weapon.

97
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,740
An unfailing weapon

98
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,710
which, when released in the
name of a particular person

99
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,900
slays that very person.

100
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,670
So be it!

101
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,640
Do remember, dear.

102
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,870
You can use this weapon

103
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,900
only once

104
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,730
and that too

105
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,900
when the enemy is right before
your eyes in the battlefield.

106
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,870
I accept it, Lord Indra.

107
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,700
Arjun

108
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,610
you will indeed die at my hands.

109
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,570
I will use the very weapon
given by your father

110
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,640
to slay you

111
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,700
very soon...

112
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Karna!

113
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,230
Karna!

114
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,230
Karna!
Karna!

115
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,330
Karna!

116
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,100
Son!

117
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,100
Karna!

118
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,130
Karna!

119
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,040
Karna!

120
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,280
Karna...
Karna!

121
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,070
Son!

122
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,270
Karna!

123
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,980
Be careful,
King of Gandhar.

124
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,170
The war begins tomorrow

125
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,170
but you are already staggering!

126
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,980
Before embarking on
an enterprise of this magnitude

127
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,170
it is quite natural to stagger,
Vasudev.

128
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,050
When man becomes presumptuous

129
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,910
he also becomes heedless.

130
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,910
And when it is time
for man to stagger

131
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,080
the entire creation

132
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,050
compels him to become heedless.

133
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,170
Various situations arise

134
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,110
which are bound to make man
presumptuous.

135
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,170
And what are
the various situations

136
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,970
you are going to give rise to
Vasudev?

137
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,980
When did I ever give rise
to a situation?

138
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,170
Man's actions

139
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,970
give rise to various situations.

140
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And our reactions
in those situations

141
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,980
bind us to them.

142
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,950
His Excellency
had your sister married

143
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,880
to a blind man
and that gave rise

144
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,110
to a situation where revenge
was born in your heart.

145
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,950
And by taking an oath
to aid your sister

146
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,010
and her sons have the throne

147
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,880
you have bound yourself
to that situation.

148
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,940
Tomorrow's war

149
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,010
is the result of that oath.
