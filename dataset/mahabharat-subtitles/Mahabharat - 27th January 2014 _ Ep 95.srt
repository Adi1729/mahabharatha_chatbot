1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,590
'Om Namah Shivaya.'

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,720
'Om Namah Shivaya.'

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,460
'Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Namah Shivaya.'

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,720
'Om Namah Shivaya.'

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,590
'Om Namah Shivaya.'

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,660
'Om Namah Shivaya.'

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,530
Greetings, grandsire.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,590
Greetings.
- Grandsire

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,690
I want to ask you a question.

10
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,620
You have unfathomable
knowledge of correctness.

11
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,690
It is said that a kingdom
devoid of a Crown Prince

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,620
is a one devoid of
the grace of the Gods.

13
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,590
Then why are you

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,690
keeping Hastinapur away
from the grace of the Gods?

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,490
Somewhere in Hastinapur
or in the Kuru kingdom

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,560
was there a scant amount of rain

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,490
leading to a drought?

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,590
Or are humans and cattle dying
without any apparent reason

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,600
in the kingdom?

20
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,530
Then how can you deem

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,660
that we do not have
the grace of the Gods?

22
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,590
How could you deem
that Hastinapur is

23
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,650
devoid of a Crown Prince?

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,550
Who is the Crown Prince?

25
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,460
Brother Yudhishthir
has passed away

26
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,530
and I have

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,390
not been anointed yet.

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,520
Nevertheless

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,620
the Gods have not kept us
away from their grace.

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,600
What is it that I am holding?

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,460
A piece of sandalwood.

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,390
Even after being abraded,
it continues emitting fragrance.

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,460
Same is the case with
being a Crown Prince.

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,590
Whether the throne is occupied
by a Crown Prince or not

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,420
the Gods know whether a Crown
Prince is present in the kingdom

36
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,390
or not.

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Does this mean, the Gods

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,620
know that I am the Crown Prince?

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,390
Then why am I not
being anointed as one?

40
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,450
Then the Kings of the
Aryan region will know

41
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,330
that I am the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur.

42
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,330
What the Gods know is the truth.

43
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,460
What the Kings of
the Aryan region know

44
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,360
changes every day.

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
And that is why

46
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,430
them knowing of it

47
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,360
has no value.

48
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,590
However, for your
contentment, if

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,490
you wish to convey
this to those Kings

50
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,450
then who am I to stop you?

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,390
You have been exceedingly
gracious, grandsire.

52
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,330
Let me go tell
father about this.

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,320
Greetings.

54
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,420
Greetings, uncle.

55
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,390
Greetings, Vidur.

56
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,250
You

57
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,260
gave Duryodhan the permission
to be anointed, uncle?

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,460
Yes.

59
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,230
When a Crown Prince
is already present

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,220
then even if other people
bathe in milk every day

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,420
they do not become
the Crown Prince.

62
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,320
Let the anointment take place.

63
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,490
When Yudhishthir
will return

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,250
this anointment will
get nullified on its own.

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,230
But our spies have not yet
found the Pandavas, uncle.

66
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,390
Who knows when they will return.

67
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,230
And until then, will Duryodhan
not get himself anointed?

68
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,380
That will not happen.

69
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
The sons of Pandu
will return soon.

70
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
I have got the news of

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
where they are.

72
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,420
But how, uncle?

73
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,220
Did you not hear

74
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,320
that a while ago,
the King of the Ogres

75
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,330
Hidimb was killed?

76
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,350
Apart from Bheem,
who else can achieve this?

77
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Bheem

78
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,540
you have become a father!

79
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,740
Today, your ancestors must be

80
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,780
showering their blessings on you
from the heavens.

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,650
Hidimba has
given birth to a son!

82
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,600
You ought to jubilate

83
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,810
and worship your King Vrikodar!

84
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,550
Your future King has been born!

85
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,710
My love, this day has brought
the greatest joy for me.

86
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,680
But along with this joy

87
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,670
there is also a great sorrow.

88
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,770
A great sorrow.

89
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,510
Congratulations, brother Bheem!

90
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,600
You have become a father.

91
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,510
Congratulations, brother Bheem!

92
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,550
You have to become serious now.

93
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,450
If we laugh at you now,
you cannot get angry.

94
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,510
Anoint him with
your blood, Vrikodar.

95
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,580
When a father anoints his
ogre sons with his blood

96
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,410
they become adults.

97
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,110
Vrikodar

98
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,950
give your son a name.

99
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,070
Me?

100
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,950
What should I name him?

101
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,980
Bheem, any name

102
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,110
that you like.

103
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,140
My son's bald head

104
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,990
is shining like a pot.

105
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,980
I name him Ghatotkacha.*
*"Bald Pot".

106
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,070
Son

107
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,920
this is your grandmother

108
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,050
and these are your uncles.

109
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,050
Go on.

110
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,150
Touch their feet
to seek their blessings.

111
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,980
Bless you!

112
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,880
May you live long.

113
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,980
May you be patient.

114
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,080
May you be victorious.

115
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,980
May you be powerful.

116
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Son

117
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,010
your father, King Vrikodar

118
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,810
is returning to the realm
of humans today.

119
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Bid him goodbye
and seek his blessings.

120
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,080
We can stay here
a while longer, dear...

121
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,870
If you want us to.

122
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,080
I wish to keep all of you
here for life, mother-in-law

123
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,020
but I had promised you

124
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,010
that after the birth
of our first child

125
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,920
I will not ask any of you
to stay here even a day longer.

126
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,050
Then how can
your daughter-in-law

127
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,010
break her promise,
mother-in-law?

128
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,780
You are the ideal woman,
Hidimba.

129
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,820
In the future

130
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,850
not only ogres

131
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,780
but also humans will
derive motivation from you.

132
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,880
People will deem you a Goddess
and worship you.

133
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,020
Bless you, dear!

134
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,790
Father, whenever
you take my name thrice

135
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,980
I shall appear before you
to be at your service.

136
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,780
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

137
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,790
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

138
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,640
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

139
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,620
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

140
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,680
Friend Kama

141
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,610
do you know the importance

142
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
of this day?

143
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,780
Until now, my life was filled
with the darkness of the night

144
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,710
and unfulfilled dreams.

145
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,690
But henceforth, I shall
have the light of the day

146
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,620
and all my dreams
will be fulfilled.
