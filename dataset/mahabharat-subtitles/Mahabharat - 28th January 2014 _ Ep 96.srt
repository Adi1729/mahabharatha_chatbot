1
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,840
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,810
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

3
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,810
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

4
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,810
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,810
All hail Prince Duryodhan!

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,810
Friend Kama

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,770
do you know the importance

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
of this day?

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,680
Until now, my life was filled
with the darkness of the night

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,650
and unfulfilled dreams.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,650
But henceforth, I shall have
the light of the day

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,710
and all my dreams
will be fulfilled.

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,770
And when it comes
to fulfilling your dreams

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,580
I shall always be
a step ahead of you.

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,670
Greetings, father.

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,670
Bless you, son!

17
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,610
Today, the dream
in these blind eyes

18
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,610
will be fulfilled, son.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,510
The blind can only see dreams

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
and not the world.

21
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,450
That is why

22
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,670
the attachment to one's dream

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,550
cannot be seen
by people with vision.

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,470
The truth is

25
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,570
I am very happy today

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,670
and I feel as though I can see.

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,480
Truly.

28
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Go on, son.

29
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,480
Go on.

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,610
Greetings, grandsire.
- Bless you.

31
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,480
Those who see only dreams
and not the world

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,610
are called blind.

33
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,480
Today, your dream
will be fulfilled.

34
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,450
I have firm faith that you too
shall be blessed with vision.

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,570
My dear!

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,580
My dear

37
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,520
what one needs to see and not

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
can be discussed later.

39
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,550
You must seek the blessings
of your mother now.

40
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,540
Greetings, mother.

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,610
Greetings, brother.
- Bless you, son.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,340
Duryodhan

43
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,480
when old clothes are adorned
with new embroidery

44
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,540
it is done only on
the existing patterns.

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,540
That adds beauty to old clothes.

46
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,420
You must glorify the memories
of your brother Yudhishthir

47
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,610
when you become
the Crown Prince.

48
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,470
When old walls are painted with
a fresh coat of paint, mother

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,420
the old paint gets covered.

50
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,320
People will forget
my elder brother

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,350
because I will be
that good a ruler.

52
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,310
All hail Crown Prince Duryodhan!

53
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
All hail Crown Prince Duryodhan!

54
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,360
All hail Crown Prince Duryodhan!
- Greetings, father.

55
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,350
May you live long, son.

56
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,350
'This wound will remind me
of how Gandhari'

57
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,180
'has met with grave injustice.'

58
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,320
'It is in the best interest
of His Highness'

59
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,160
'to have Duryodhan anointed'

60
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,380
'as the Crown Prince.'

61
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,210
'Until the sons of Pandu return'

62
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,140
'no one will be anointed
as the Crown Prince.'

63
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,140
Uncle

64
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,320
the 'swayamvar' of
the Princess of Panchal

65
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,290
awaits me now.

66
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,360
Princess Draupadi herself

67
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,250
is awaiting none but you,
my darling!

68
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,350
Sons, you should rest
for a while now.

69
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,220
You must be tired from lifting
my weight all this while.

70
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,320
One who considers
his mother to be a weight

71
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,310
indeed gets tired.

72
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,220
You need not worry, mother.

73
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,380
When they get tired,
I shall lift you.

74
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,220
I had told them earlier

75
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,150
that I am capable of lifting
the palanquin by myself

76
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
but they refused
to listen to me.

77
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,150
We too must get the opportunity
to serve mother, brother Bheem.

78
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,260
But why do you not
help us lift the palanquin?

79
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,080
Have you seen how tall I am?

80
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,120
If I hold the palanquin
from one side

81
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,090
mother will have to sit
in a crooked manner.

82
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,260
Besides, this is probably the way to Naimisharanya.*
*Naimisha Forest lay on the banks of the Gomati River (in Uttar Pradesh now), between the Panchala Kingdom and the Kosala Kingdom.

83
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,190
We shall come across a village
or hermitage on this path soon.

84
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,260
Someone will guide us then.

85
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,320
Oh, Lord!

86
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,020
Oh, Lord! - I can see
people over there.

87
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,210
Wait right here.

88
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,310
Let me go check.

89
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,190
Oh, Lord!

90
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,050
May you live long.
Have a long life.

91
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,020
All hail Lord Vedvyas!

92
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,990
All hail Lord Vedvyas!

93
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,020
All hail Lord Vedvyas!

94
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,210
Go on, villagers.

95
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,150
One serpent had bitten him.

96
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,180
Do not take your anger out
on all the serpents.

97
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,080
Now, I am expecting some guests

98
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,150
whom I had been
awaiting for a while.

99
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,950
Go on.

100
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Come over here.

101
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,080
I have been awaiting you in
this forest for three days now.

102
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,750
What is your name?

103
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,910
How can you expect the people

104
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,910
whose names you do not know?

105
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,810
Names are not the only mode
to get to know people, Bheem.

106
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,820
How did you know

107
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,810
that my name is Bheem?

108
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,850
I had heard that only you
can ask such questions.

109
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,790
Where is your mother Kunti

110
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,750
and the four brothers of yours?

111
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,810
Call them here as well.

112
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,950
My disciples have arranged
for you to rest and dine here.

113
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,960
Stay here for the night
and leave at dawn.

114
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,790
The great sage Vedvyas!

115
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,920
Greetings!
- May you live long.

116
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,910
May you live long.

117
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,810
Be seated. Lifting the palanquin
must have left all of you tired.

118
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,780
I knew

119
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,690
that the fire in Varnavrat

120
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,850
could never burn
the sons of Pandu.

121
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,710
But My Lord, it is our wish

122
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,810
that the world deems us dead.

123
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,820
My Lord

124
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,710
did we take
an appropriate decision?

125
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,860
Man has the delusion

126
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,860
that he takes all decisions
on his own

127
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,760
but one who lives by clouding
his vision with emotions

128
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,690
cannot take a decision
on his own, Kunti.

129
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,650
The truth is

130
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,720
those decisions
are taken by fate.

131
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,620
The decision you have
taken is appropriate

132
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,820
but very soon it will
become inappropriate.

133
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,790
What do you mean?

134
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,710
I believe, you shall
get your answers

135
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,720
in Kampilya,
the city of King Drupad.

136
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,590
When you leave tomorrow at dawn

137
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,750
while proceeding towards
Naimisharanya

138
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,850
all of you must take rest
in the city of Kampilya.

139
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Kampilya?

140
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,750
Draupadi

141
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,650
to compete for your
hand in marriage

142
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,620
every King and Prince
of the Aryan region

143
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,620
is quite eager.

144
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,590
107 noble men

145
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,550
have come here with the
intention of marrying you.

146
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,560
It is quite evident from the
presents sent by the Kings

147
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,680
that your marriage holds
great political value.

148
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,780
I have understood the value
of my marriage, sister.

149
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,550
But what is my value
in this marriage?

150
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,550
Why are you asking
such a question, Draupadi?

151
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,580
I feel restless, sister.

152
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,750
Despite being served
in a gold platter

153
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,550
food does not become tastier.

154
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,650
Will the Prince
who wins the competition

155
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,710
be able to win me over?

156
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,620
The day of the 'swayamvar'

157
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,590
I will certainly have
107 questions before me

158
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,710
but will there be
a single answer

159
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
to my questions?

160
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,490
Princess...
Princess!

161
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,450
Princess, take a look

162
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,720
at what I have brought for you.

163
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,680
What is that, Malini?

164
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,680
It is for you.
I have brought it for you.

165
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,480
The city of King Drupad

166
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,320
Kampilya, lies
right before us, mother.

167
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,350
We must look for
a place to rest here.

168
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,550
There must be an inn somewhere.

169
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,510
Who is he, sister?

170
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,450
He is Arjun.

171
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,450
Greetings.

172
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,340
Greetings.

173
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,480
King Drupad has sent
many such paintings to the spies

174
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,350
in every corner
of the Aryan region

175
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,320
to look for Arjun

176
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,450
and to invite him
to the 'swayamvar'

177
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,290
so that he comes to the event

178
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,260
and gets married to you.

179
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
This is what King Drupad wants.

180
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,220
And what do you want, Govind?
