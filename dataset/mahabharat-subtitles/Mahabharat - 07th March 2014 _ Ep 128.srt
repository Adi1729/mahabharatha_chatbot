1
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,840
Vrushali.

2
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,700
You need not worry, dear.

3
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,660
Even though I cannot go
to Indraprastha

4
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,690
it is alright.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,710
I will request Her Highness

6
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,870
to ensure that you
get your freedom.

7
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,640
I know

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,690
that the day

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,640
I plead to sister-in-law

10
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,600
will be the last day of my life.

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,770
But I

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,630
am the mother of the Pandavas.

13
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,800
The promise I made you

14
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,760
cannot be broken by me.

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,640
All hail Queen Mother!

16
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,710
King Karna of Anga
seeks permission to enter.

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,530
Allow him to enter.

18
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,800
Greetings,
Queen Mother!

19
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,690
Bless you!

20
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,760
I have ensured
Vrushali's freedom.

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Let's go,
Vrushali.

22
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,540
I shall take you to the borders
of Indraprastha safely.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,540
I...

24
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,630
Pardon me.

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,470
But

26
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,540
I can go there by myself.

27
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,470
You need not bother
yourself with it.

28
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,570
Why?

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,500
Do you doubt my character?

30
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,470
No!

31
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,470
No, Your Highness.

32
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,590
I do not doubt your character.

33
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,600
But...

34
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,530
Pardon me.

35
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,540
I have travelled
with the royalty once.

36
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,700
Your Highness

37
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,530
when an elephant
comes to pluck lotuses

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,670
it does not crush the flowers.

39
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,470
It crushes the leaves
and the stems.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,660
When a predicament approaches

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,600
it is the subjects that suffer.

42
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,700
I am not a King
anymore, Vrushali.

43
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,640
I have renounced the kingdom.

44
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,500
Now, I am just like you.

45
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,600
I am merely an ordinary
son of a charioteer.

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,610
You shall be safe with me.

47
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,500
Seek the permission to leave
from the Queen Mother.

48
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,370
Go on,
Vrushali.

49
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,530
Maharathi Karna

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,430
I would like you

51
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,600
to give my sons this...

52
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,600
Could you kindly
deliver this message

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,600
to my sons?

54
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,400
A written message,
Queen Mother!

55
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,410
You must certainly
have faith in me.

56
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,340
My mother has renounced me

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,530
but I have not yet
renounced her.

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,370
The values and righteousness
imparted to me

59
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,490
have not been forgotten by me.

60
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,510
Let me tell you
what the message is, Karna.

61
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,340
Tell my sons that...
- But think once

62
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,600
before telling me what
the message is, Queen Mother.

63
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,460
I have not yet renounced
my friendship.

64
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,500
Undying dedication to my friend

65
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,530
is still a part of my values.

66
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,340
I have faith

67
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,460
that whatever you do

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
will be in accordance
with righteousness.

69
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,340
Tell my sons

70
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,300
that a true kingdom

71
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,500
is an independent one.

72
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,370
Only when a gem
emerges from a rock

73
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,270
does it truly shine.

74
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,440
If you seek the refuge
of Hastinapur

75
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,500
you will always be a part
of unrighteousness.

76
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,500
That is why,
you must

77
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,500
earn a flag of your own
kingdom at the earliest.

78
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,460
Only when your kingdom
is independent

79
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,240
will your mother
enter Indraprastha.

80
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,200
If any 'Brahmin'

81
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,240
traveller or requester

82
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,430
requires money

83
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,170
then I, son of Adhiratha
Karna, request him

84
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,330
to accept this charity
from me for which

85
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,170
I will be very grateful.

86
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,400
Revered 'Brahmins'

87
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,330
will you not accept
charity from me today?

88
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,170
We cannot accept charity
from you, Radheya.

89
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,330
One is prohibited to accept
charity from a 'Shudra.'

90
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,370
But yesterday, you had accepted
charity from this very 'Shudra'

91
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,140
revered 'Brahmins.'

92
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,140
Until yesterday,
you were a King, Radheya.

93
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,070
Being a King is regardless
of one's competence.

94
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,340
A tiger and a cat look similar

95
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,110
but we behave differently
with both of them.

96
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
In other words

97
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,170
you were afraid of me.

98
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,270
That if you did not
accept charity from me

99
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,100
I would punish you.

100
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,330
Did you accept the charity
out of this fear?

101
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,300
Think what you may
but why are you

102
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,140
making us engage in this
unrighteous deed now?

103
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,160
We cannot accept the charity
being given by you.

104
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,100
I have merely
renounced my kingdom.

105
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,070
I have not yet
renounced my weapons.

106
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,140
I am still powerful.

107
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,260
I accept your charity,
Maharathi.

108
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,230
Please give me some.

109
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,190
Bless you!

110
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,130
Water stored only in a
baked pot is worth consuming.

111
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,030
An unbaked pot

112
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,070
renders even the water from the
Ganges unfit for consumption.

113
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,190
Similarly

114
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,240
blessings given out of the
fear of weapons is worthless.

115
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,060
And worthless

116
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,140
is the person
giving the blessings.

117
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,130
Revered 'Brahmins'

118
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,110
would you clarify
a doubt of mine?

119
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,030
Does a person lacking competence

120
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,100
not entitled to even
engage in religious deeds?

121
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,940
The deeds of one's past life
decide all this.

122
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,100
In his past life

123
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,230
he must have
hurt people immensely.

124
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,170
That is why, he is in pain
in his present life, child.

125
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,130
And after enduring great pain
in his present life

126
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,160
his next life will be
a blissful one.

127
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,130
But what about

128
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,060
the pain you are afflicting
Maharathi Karna in this life?

129
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,030
What will you get

130
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,000
in your next lives,
revered 'Brahmins?'

131
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,480
What will you get

132
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,410
in your next lives,
revered 'Brahmins?'

133
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,220
Brother Yudhishthir,
you are the King of Indraprastha

134
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,410
but we are being subjected
to injustice here!

135
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,410
You must uphold justice.

136
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,460
Why are you so agitated,
My Lord?

137
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,420
We just got the news
from Hastinapur

138
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,450
that no one is allowed to attend
the reverence of Indraprastha.

139
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,190
Not even the royal family.

140
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,180
Not even mother.

141
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,250
Hastinapur has
imprisoned mother.

142
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,220
The truth is, the entire
kingdom of Hastinapur

143
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,260
has now become a prison
for mother, Panchali.

144
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,420
Does mother-in-law require
permission to take part

145
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,190
in the reverence of our city?

146
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,180
The truth is

147
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,220
that even for the
reverence of a city

148
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,210
one requires
permission, friend.

149
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,350
Fortunately,
His Highness

150
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,350
has already taken that decision.

151
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,340
None of you

152
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
are independent to take

153
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,280
a decision on your own.

154
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,080
Obeying the orders of Hastinapur

155
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,220
is your duty.

156
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,320
I am not concerned
about the duties!

157
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,250
That rule applies only to
brother Yudhishthir.

158
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,280
All I know is that
if someone loves you

159
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,340
you must be ready
to die for them.

160
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,120
And the one who is your enemy

161
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,310
deserves to die at your hands!

162
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,090
That is why,
you are so dear to me

163
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,120
brother Bheem.

164
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,290
What do you suggest,
Govind?

165
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,150
It is true

166
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,210
that attacking Hastinapur
would be committing treason.

167
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,180
And it is also true

168
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
that this rule

169
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,150
applies only to the King

170
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,090
and

171
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,120
not to the sons of a mother.

172
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,150
Speak clearly,
Madhav.

173
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,120
How can I speak clearly, friend?

174
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,210
She is your mother

175
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,050
it is your kingdom

176
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
the weapons are yours

177
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,210
and the duty...

178
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,120
The duty belongs
to all of you as well.

179
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
What can we do in such a
situation, brother Yudhishthir?

180
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,110
I cannot order you to attack.

181
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,220
And neither can I lend you
the army of Indraprastha.

182
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,020
But

183
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,250
in order to build
a case for mother

184
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,090
if all of you go to Hastinapur

185
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,150
to request to His Highness

186
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
then I cannot stop you
from doing so either.

187
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,220
I cannot stop you
from carrying weapons and

188
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,250
if you have to take to arms
in your defense

189
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,950
then I cannot stop you
from doing so either.

190
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,050
But do remember

191
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,140
that if any of you

192
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,090
is the first one to attack

193
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,090
then I shall
renounce the kingdom.

194
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Maharathi* Karna!
*Great charioteer, great hero/warrior, name of Shiva.

195
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,070
Maharathi Karna

196
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,980
can you ever pardon me?

197
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,910
Pardon you?

198
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,110
For what?

199
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,120
I spoke ill of you

200
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,950
and you renounced your kingdom.

201
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,910
The result was that the insult
you had left far behind

202
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
has caught up...

203
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,950
Has caught up to you.

204
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,010
You need not apologize,
Vrushali.

205
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,110
The dilemma is

206
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,850
that in order to be righteous,
I attained my competence

207
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,880
but my competence propelled me
towards unrighteousness.

208
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
The truth is

209
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,980
you have opened
my eyes, Vrushali.

210
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,140
How can someone else's behaviour

211
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,140
compel me to leave
my righteous ways?

212
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,950
I am indebted to you.

213
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,810
You are so benevolent

214
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
and forgiving,
Maharathi Karna.

215
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,910
I did not know that.

216
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,980
And that

217
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,010
at such a young age

218
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,780
you could have such a deep
understanding of life's truths

219
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,880
is something I was unaware of.

220
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,840
The path that I

221
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,810
was unable to see until now

222
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,950
has been shown to me
by you so effortlessly.

223
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Whoever haves you in his life

224
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
would certainly
never lose his way.
