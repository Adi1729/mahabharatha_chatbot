1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,800
And

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,080
what about
the five sons of mine?

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,000
Govind!

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,240
Will they...

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,760
Will they d-die as well?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,120
Govind

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,840
I beg of you!

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,240
Please give me
a definite answer this time.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,080
Tell me, Govind!

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,080
What will be
the outcome of the war?

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,120
I want to know, Govind!
Tell me.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,600
A war always brings
destruction, Panchali.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,000
Nothing but agony and suffering
are born in the battlefield.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,720
How could you think, there
would be joy for you in it?

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,440
Yes.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,520
Apart from the five
husbands of yours

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,440
the entire lineage
of King Shantanu

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
will be destroyed.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,040
The entire dynasty will be
annihilated in this war.

20
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
Govind

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,440
will King Pandu's entire dynasty

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,760
be sacrificed in this war?

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,800
My children...

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
During times of struggle

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,320
their mere thought would
give us the strength we needed.

26
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,040
Their birth had given us...
Had given us a new life.

27
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
Will they die?

28
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,760
In other words

29
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,800
the war we are preparing for

30
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,520
with such zeal
and fervour, Govind

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,640
is like a preparation...
Like a preparation

32
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,040
for sending our children to die?

33
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,320
There is not a moment
in a man's life

34
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,120
when he is not walking
towards death, friend.

35
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,880
The truth is,
are all his activities

36
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,520
not aimed at dying?

37
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,000
Is each leaf born during spring

38
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,320
not meant to fall off
during the fall?

39
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Is its birth

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,080
absorbing the rays of the sun

41
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,200
and producing a melody

42
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,560
while swaying in the wind

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
utterly worthless?

44
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
When a tornado shakes up a tree

45
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,680
each leaf of that tree
tries its very best

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,360
to hold onto it.

47
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,480
And when the leaves turn yellow

48
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
they fall off gladly.

49
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,720
The creation is also
like a great tree, friend.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,240
And every human being,
flora and fauna is a leaf

51
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,200
which grows and then falls off

52
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
that tree.

53
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,640
Their falling off is certain

54
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,080
but until they are on the tree

55
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,320
it is vital for them

56
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,040
to experience both
struggle and peace.

57
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,880
I see no upside to this,
Govind.

58
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
Because you are bound
by attachment, friend.

59
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Yes!

60
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
I am bound by attachment,
Govind.

61
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,640
And even if we emerge
victorious in this war

62
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
it will give me no joy.

63
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,320
When did I say that you would
get joy out of this war, friend?

64
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,480
When did I advise you to fight

65
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
to seek revenge,
respect and property?

66
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,720
This war

67
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,960
is for the joy
of the society, friend.

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,520
In order to put an end
to unrighteousness

69
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,480
and to establish
righteousness again

70
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,920
we must fight this war,
friend.

71
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,360
Why should such a big sacrifice

72
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,640
be made by us,
Govind?

73
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
Why?

74
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
Listen, friend.

75
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,200
In a society, man must abide by
rules, ideals and righteousness.

76
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,440
These three entities are like

77
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,640
sand castles
built on the sea-shore.

78
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,640
The waves of time
keep breaking them constantly.

79
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,600
They need to be
built time and again

80
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
otherwise

81
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,760
rules, ideals and righteousness

82
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,320
get annihilated.

83
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,640
The Almighty gives
very few the strength

84
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,520
needed to establish
righteousness again.

85
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,440
And even after sacrificing
everything they have

86
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,720
the people who have
this strength

87
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,040
end up struggling
for righteousness.

88
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Be it Lord Ram

89
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
Lord Parashuram

90
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,880
or the Vaman Avatar of Vishnu

91
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,080
this world reveres only those
who struggle towards

92
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,480
establishing righteousness.

93
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,800
You must understand,
friend

94
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,320
that struggling
for righteousness

95
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,960
is not a duty

96
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,280
but a decision

97
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,240
and a vow.

98
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,920
Similarly, for you,
this war

99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
is not a duty.

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
It is a vow

101
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
taken for the society.

102
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,440
You may break this vow
whenever you want.

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
You might

104
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
just be blessed with the joy

105
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,160
of children, husbands
and grandchildren

106
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,840
but like millions of people

107
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,840
you too will be lost
in the sands of time, friend.

108
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,080
Your life will become worthless.

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
Because of you

110
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,320
no one will benefit anything.

111
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,160
The Almighty who has
given you special powers

112
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,440
will lose His faith in you.

113
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,840
The decision

114
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
is yours, friend.

115
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,840
Sister-in-law!

116
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,240
Come here.

117
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,720
Sister-in-law

118
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,920
here we have a coconut, a hair
ornament and a wedding dress.

119
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,520
We need to present
all this to Uttara.

120
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
Let's go.

121
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,240
Sister-in-law

122
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,000
please come.

123
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,480
Sister-in-law

124
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
place your hand on this.

125
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
'Apart from the five
husbands of yours'

126
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
'the entire lineage
of King Shantanu'

127
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,040
'will be destroyed.'

128
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,040
'The entire dynasty will be
annihilated in this war.'

129
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Sons
can someone tell me

130
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,800
how these 'laddoos'
can be consumed

131
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,840
without folding the arm?

132
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,760
Our sons have reminded us
of our childhood.

133
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,520
You are correct,
brother Bheem.

134
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,480
And after a few years

135
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
their children will remind them
of their childhood.

136
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,280
In other words, our sons
have immortalised us.

137
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Mother Draupadi...
Mother Draupadi.

138
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,120
Mother?

139
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,760
Please tell us

140
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,160
how we can eat
without folding our arms.

141
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,840
Please tell us, mother.

142
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,840
Please come.
Come with me.

143
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,800
Come.

144
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Be seated.

145
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,440
Tell us,
Mother Draupadi.

146
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,240
How do we eat
without folding our arms?

147
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,320
What decision
have you taken, friend?

148
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,160
Govind

149
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,560
a sapling planted by a person

150
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,240
cannot be pulled out by him.

151
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,560
How will I be able
to see my sons die?

152
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,400
In the court of Hastinapur,
a woman was insulted

153
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,320
but she tolerated it.

154
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,080
But a mother will not be able to
tolerate her sons getting slain

155
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Govind.

156
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
A wife tolerated
the loss of property

157
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,680
of her husbands

158
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,080
but a mother will not be able to
tolerate the death of her sons

159
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,120
Govind.

160
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
No.

161
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,360
I am willing

162
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,080
to forget all the insults,
Govind.

163
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,760
This property,
the empire...

164
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,560
I am willing to give up
all of it, Govind.

165
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
But no...

166
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,240
I cannot send my sons
to the battlefield.

167
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,680
No.

168
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,360
