1
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,940
Durochan

2
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,800
anyone more skilled than you in
constructing a grand house

3
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,900
won't be found in Hastinapur.

4
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,880
That's why I have summoned
you for this work.

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,810
The palace for Kunti
and Pandavas

6
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,900
should stand shorter than
other palaces, Durochan!

7
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,740
But make sure that from
Duryodhan's sleeping chambers

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,870
the Pandavas' flag
shouldn't be visible.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,680
Don't worry, Your Highness.

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,740
I'll not give anyone a reason
to be unsatisfied.

11
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,640
Disperse!

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,870
Duryodhan...

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,740
Son

14
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,870
why do you seem so dull?
- I'm not dull

15
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,710
but I'm very furious, father!

16
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Come close to me, son.

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,810
What's the problem, dear?
- Problem?

18
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,710
The problem is that
I hail from royalty.

19
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,800
The problem is that my father
is an emperor.

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,610
Had I been born in a normal
business family or at sculptor's

21
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,740
or a cowherd's family

22
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,800
I wouldn't have faced
this problem.

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,770
What are you saying, son?

24
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,570
Every son is a successor
to his father.

25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,770
To acquire the livestock

26
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,570
a cowherd's son doesn't have to
wait for coronation.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,740
If the businessman's son
is not competent enough

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,840
then his family faces a problem.

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,700
But if the king's son
is not competent enough

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,770
then the entire kingdom faces
problems, Duryodhan.

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,640
Well said.

32
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,600
Well said.

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,670
Even I was trying to explain

34
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,610
the same to Duryodhan

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,540
dear Gandhari.

36
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,800
Duryodhan

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,770
you've accepted

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,610
that you are the successor
to your father

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,740
but it's

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,510
a disbelief.

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,770
Your father is helpless.

42
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,770
Till His Excellency Bhishma
is the de facto authority

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,700
His Highness can't take any
decision on his own. - Shakuni!

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,730
Forgive me, Your Highness

45
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,510
if I have said

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,670
something wrong.

47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,730
I was just
trying to explain him

48
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,640
that he'll have to prove
his potential

49
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,640
or else
Bhim and Yudhishthir

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
becoming recluses

51
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,680
can only be prayed for.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,680
Keep quiet, Shakuni!

53
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,680
I've heard enough.

54
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,680
As an emperor
of Hastinapur

55
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,610
only you will be enthroned, son.

56
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,440
It's a promise
by your father.

57
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,710
The coronation ceremony will be
conducted for you shortly.

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Shortly.

59
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,440
I'll discuss with grandsire

60
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,700
about this matter.
- But lord...

61
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,530
Buts

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,670
are obsolete, Gandhari.

63
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,670
Before speaking
anything contrary

64
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,500
answer my question

65
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,600
and if not me, answer it
to yourself.

66
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,510
Don't you want your son

67
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,670
to be enthroned as
a king of Hastinapur?

68
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,470
Certainly

69
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,610
but I want my son
to be a competent king

70
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,670
who values righteousness.

71
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,470
A golden crown is bejeweled only
after it's moulded, Gandhari

72
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,600
and not before that.

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,570
When my son will become a king

74
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,540
he'll prove his competency.

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,630
Today I'll order Vidur for
arranging the coronation.

76
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,340
Duryodhan

77
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,440
we'll have
to plan out something

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,430
so that the sons of Pandu

79
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,470
leave Hastinapur
and go away forever.

80
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,480
Create such a situation
for them

81
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,480
that Kunti is compelled
to take them

82
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,600
to Kuntibhoj.

83
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,340
I hope
you're getting my point.

84
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,470
But why, uncle?

85
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,500
Father will anyway get
me coronated.

86
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,410
My dear.
You foolish darling!

87
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,310
It's Kuru empire.

88
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,440
Your grandsire Bhishma

89
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,340
will stop you
from being coronated.

90
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,470
But why?
- Because his love for Pandavas

91
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,410
is above all.

92
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,340
He sides with them.
Just for this reason.

93
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,370
If they protest against me

94
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,440
even then
grandsire will favour them.

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,310
But those five wouldn't protest
at all, dear Duryodhan.

96
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
All the five of them

97
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,370
follow the path
of righteousness

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,310
and those who tread that path

99
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,340
can be

100
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,410
meted out injustice
in copious amounts.

101
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,440
Those following the path
of inequity

102
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,240
aren't affected
by righteousness, grandsire.

103
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,500
And Duryodhan

104
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,470
has started on
the path of iniquity.

105
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,300
I have a fear, grandsire

106
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,280
that the future of Kuru lineage
is going to be really dreadful.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,430
There's nothing to be so upset
about, Vidur.

108
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,270
A gardener fastens
a creeper to a pole

109
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,330
and the creeper slowly

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,240
learns to climb on the pole.

111
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,310
If a child is given a lesson
on what is just and unjust

112
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,270
then even he can, soon

113
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,310
change his disposition

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,340
and mentality.

115
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,430
These 105 kids fostering

116
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,400
love

117
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,210
trust

118
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,330
and respect for each other
is mandatory.

119
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,330
How will we teach them to love
each other, grandsire?

120
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Vidur

121
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,210
persons living together develop
love for each other

122
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
just like when the water
and seed come close

123
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,340
a sapling is but inevitable.

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,240
Just the ways
of living together

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,440
and spending a life
has to be taught.

126
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,330
That has to be taught
with determination.

127
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,330
Hey!

128
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,140
Brother, for whom is this
grand dinner organised?

129
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,230
It's nothing like that, Bhim.

130
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,340
It's a daily routine
in the palace.

131
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,300
For all the attendants, guards,
the ministry

132
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,210
and the royal family,
such food is prepared daily.

133
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Do you remember,
father used to say

134
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,200
the kingdom in which
the attendants are hungry

135
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,210
stays troubled itself.

136
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,140
So that implies I can
eat to my fill daily!

137
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,270
You, anyhow, look for an option
to satisfy your hunger, brother.

138
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,070
We all now could
eat to my fill...

139
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
Say like that.

140
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,180
Don't I let you all have food?

141
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,270
Nakul, don't make me angry.

142
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,070
Go and count

143
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,070
the varieties of dishes.

144
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,110
Stop!

145
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,730
Stop!

146
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,570
What are you doing?

147
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,660
How can you eat
without permission?

148
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,570
Permission? Whose?
Yours?

149
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,700
Behold. These wild men aren't
even aware of royal etiquettes.

150
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,570
This is what happens

151
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,770
when you stay in the forest
with animals for too long.

152
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,610
But they are our brothers.

153
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,700
So are the orders of grandsire.
So we must teach them better.

154
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,640
Look who's seated there.

155
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,600
Who is he?

156
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,510
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?

157
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,560
Go. Seek his permission.

158
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,700
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?

159
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,540
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?

160
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,470
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?

161
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,630
Massage the minister's feet.

162
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,700
Minister, may I eat a 'laddoo'?

163
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,660
Seems like the elder brother
must massage minister's feet.

164
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,600
Come forth, elder brother.

165
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,660
Elder brother.

166
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,660
Let it be.
I do not wish to eat.

167
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,470
You need to eat sometime.

168
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:45,630
Without the minister's consent
you may never be allowed to eat.

169
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,570
Come forth, elder brother.

170
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,630
Elder brother,
I don't want to eat!

171
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,440
Dear brother Duryodhan.

172
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,570
Kindly allow Bhim
to have a 'laddoo'.

173
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,630
So much malice isn't good.

174
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,570
Let no one be served
prior to meal time.

175
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,540
These are the orders
of the food minister.

176
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,820
Sugdha.

177
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,700
Why is this room
so well decorated?

178
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,660
Queen Gandhari had ordered

179
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,760
that your room be
as well decorated as hers.

180
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,890
I am not a queen.

181
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,760
I'm the wife of a hermit.

182
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,650
I and my sons

183
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,730
sleep on a makeshift
straw mat on the floor.

184
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,630
But the members of
the royal family

185
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,860
must get accustomed to
decorative and ornate things.

186
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,850
Dushala.

187
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,750
Come here.

188
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,790
I was so eager to see you.

189
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,690
Greetings.

190
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,730
Greetings. - Stepmother Kunti,
where are your sons?

191
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,590
Mother had asked me
to greet them too.

192
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,630
They have gone
to have their meals.

193
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,820
My sons are your brothers.

194
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,600
You have
a 105 brothers.

195
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,560
105 brothers?

196
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,790
Aren't you happy to have
so many brothers?

197
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,750
But

198
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,560
brother Duryodhan
wasn't pleased.

199
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,620
But why?

200
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
He was saying

201
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,560
that your sons are here
to become the crown princes.

202
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,690
But brother Duryodhan wishes
to be the crown prince.

203
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,690
And he says that your sons
are his foes.

204
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,620
Princes, henceforth, as per
His Excellency Bhishma's orders

205
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,530
there shall be changes in
the seating arrangements.

206
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Prince Duryodhan,
Prince Dushashan

207
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,620
Prince Dussahan,
Prince Dushalan

208
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,460
Prince Jalgranthar
and Prince Shaman.

209
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,460
The six of you,
for the five Pandavas

210
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,530
will have to share seats.

211
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,430
Prince Duryodhan, seats be
arranged for the sons of Pandu.

212
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,590
Right now.

213
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,560
Prince Duryodhan.

214
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,590
Let the meals be served
to the princes.

215
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,620
One more.

216
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,620
One more.

217
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,590
Two more.

218
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,360
Glutton.

219
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,450
Today there is
a simple rule to the meal.

220
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,430
No one will bend
their elbow

221
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,520
while having their meals today.

222
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,490
You may now commence
with the meals.
