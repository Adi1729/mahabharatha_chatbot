1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,550
Is it a fist of arrogance

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,090
or a cupped palm of sacrifice
that you have assumed?

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,050
Can you digest this fact?

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,390
What is this world, Arjun?

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,250
Humans, demons, animals, birds

6
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,120
parasites, insects,
fishes, trees.

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,190
How are all these created?

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,950
What substance
are they created from?

9
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,320
How do they function
and how do they survive?

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,090
How do they die?

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,720
And what happens after death?

12
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,420
Ponder upon this secret.

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,020
A human body is made from dirt,
Krishna.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,050
Water flows through it
as blood and other humours.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,350
Fire gives the body heat.

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,060
And the blank voids in the body
consist of space.

17
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,650
Therefore, earth, wind, water,
fire and space...

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,450
The body is created from
these five base elements.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,050
Therefore, Grandsire Bhishma,
Master Drona

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,520
are nothing more than earth,
water, wind

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,480
fire and space.

22
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,120
Even the learned scholars are
comprised of five base elements

23
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,450
and so are the tyrants.

24
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,050
So, what are you pining for,
Arjun?

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,350
For dirt?

26
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,120
But Krishna, it is through this
body made of dirt

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,620
that humans assume
their identities.

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,250
All bonds are rooted
in this body made of dirt.

29
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,280
No, Arjun!

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,210
If this were true

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,620
then why is one's body
destroyed post death?

32
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,680
In reality

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,920
neither is one's
identity from his body

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,350
nor are his relationships
rooted in his body.

35
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,180
One's behaviour and his nature

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,080
and his deeds are his identity.

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,020
How are behaviour, nature

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,260
and deeds even created?

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,450
Comprehend that, Arjun!

40
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,880
A human life

41
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,950
is a mere harmony of visible
and invisible entities, Arjun.

42
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,290
Yet every human's nature

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,910
and his deeds

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,280
seem to vary vastly.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,990
The reason for it is the three 'Gunas'* of nature.
*Operational principles or tendencies.

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,120
'Tamas',* 'Rajas'** and 'Sattva'***.
*Negative, lethargic, dull, or slow. **Change, movement or dynamism. ***Balance, order, or purity.

47
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,990
What are these three properties,
Krishna?

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,020
'Tamas' means darkness.

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,910
Spending one's life without
presuming about good or bad

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,890
is said to be 'Tamas' oriented
behaviour.

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,180
Just as birds and animals live

52
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,920
solely to fulfill
their bodily cravings.

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,750
'Sattva' means
the light of knowledge.

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,180
When a person,
in every circumstance

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,390
thinks about justice, truth

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,480
and tradition before acting

57
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,780
then it is termed as
'Sattva' oriented way of life.

58
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,110
Amidst these two
is such a person

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,780
who does possess knowledge

60
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,420
but he is also tethered to
the desires of body and mind.

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,020
Such a person lives
with an arrogant

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,990
which means, 'Rajas' oriented
mindset.

63
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,010
By the very balance

64
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,380
of 'Tamas', 'Rajas'
and 'Sattva' 'Gunas'

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,350
a man's nature is determined.

66
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,750
Look ahead, Arjun!

67
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,450
What 'Gunas' do you see
in all of them?

68
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,280
Prince Duryodhan
knows what is just

69
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,420
but he never acts upon them.

70
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,050
His life revolves around
arrogance.

71
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,290
Therefore, he possesses
less of 'Tamas'.

72
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,860
He possesses more of 'Rajas'

73
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,660
and 'Sattva' is totally absent.

74
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,880
And over there
is Prince Dushyasan.

75
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,780
He has always obeyed
his elder brother's orders

76
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,720
without any forethought.

77
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,350
Therefore, he possesses
only 'Tamas'.

78
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,660
Look at Grandsire Bhishma
as well, Arjun.

79
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,320
He possesses balanced amounts
of 'Sattva' and 'Tamas'.

80
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,860
He harbours no arrogance.

81
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,990
But he is bound by outdated
thoughts and old traditions.

82
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,790
Even when the need arises
he cannot break his oath.

83
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,050
Look at
Master Drona!

84
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,550
He possesses both knowledge
and arrogance.

85
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,790
Knowledge liberates a human.

86
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,190
But his arrogance
won't let him attain liberation.

87
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,750
But Krishna

88
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,720
if a human's nature is the union
of these three 'Gunas'

89
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,580
is a human's actions
predestined?

90
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,190
That a lion shall
devour a gazelle

91
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,980
and a gazelle is bound to
fear a lion.

92
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Then why is justice vital?

93
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,650
Why do crimes need
to be punished?

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,480
What is the purpose of that?

95
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,890
A brilliant question, Arjun!

96
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,750
But first comprehend what
a human being is!

97
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,110
A human isn't just the union
of the five base elements.

98
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,780
Not just five entities.

99
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,020
Five 'Gyanendriyas',* five 'Karmendriyas'**
*Sensory organs: Akshi (The Eyes), Karna (The Ears), Nasika (The Nostrils), Jihwa (The Tongue), Twacha (The Skin). **

100
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,780
and three 'Gunas'...

101
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,110
Not even just the union
of 23 such entities.

102
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,880
In order for a human
to walk around function

103
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,120
he needs energy.

104
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,780
And energy is termed as 'Chetana'.*
*Chaitanya: 'consciousness' or 'universal CHUT' or 'spirit' or 'intelligence' or 'sensation'.

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,620
So, Krishna, is a human
comprised of 'Chetana'?

106
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
No, Arjuna!

107
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,180
Along with a human's 'Chetana'
the union of those 23 entities

108
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,650
is creation.

109
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,410
Residing in this device called
human made of 24 entities

110
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,520
is a 'man', which means
a fragment of God.

111
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,450
That is termed the soul.

112
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,550
When the creation and man
become one

113
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,620
which means,
when a fragment of God

114
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,190
resides in one's body as a soul

115
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,750
that is when a human
comes to life.

116
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,110
What is a soul, Krishna?

117
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,580
And what is the means
of comprehending it?

118
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,780
Just as a human uses a chariot

119
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,990
similarly the soul uses
this device called a body.

120
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,140
Through the medium of a body

121
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,420
it experiences the joys
and sorrows of the body.

122
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,720
But the soul is not the body,
Arjun.

123
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,150
The body can be destroyed.

124
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,620
But a soul cannot be destroyed.

125
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,510
"Nainam chhindanti shastrani,
nainam dahati pavakah"

126
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,890
"na chamam kkadayanti apo,
na sosayati marutah."

127
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,850
A soul can neither be pierced
by weapons

128
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,050
nor can it be burnt with fire.

129
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,550
Nor can water render it weak,
nor can the wind dry it.

130
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,820
Even though a soul resides
in the body

131
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,920
it is immortal!

132
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,620
"Na hanyak: hanyamane sharire."

133
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,750
Arjun, a body can be killed

134
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,760
but the soul cannot
be killed!

135
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,920
A soul is omnipresent,
intangible, stable.

136
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,720
It is eternal.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,580
Just as a man discards
old garments and wears new ones

138
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,090
similarly the soul leaves
an old body

139
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,520
and assumes a new body
time and again.

140
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,050
But, Krishna

141
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,910
I experience the world
through my body.

142
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,490
Without understanding
my very body

143
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,420
how can I understand my soul?

144
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,680
Knowing oneself
in the form of a soul

145
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,650
isn't impossible either,
Arjun.

146
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,680
Even the blind ones live.

147
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,450
Even the mute ones live.

148
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,650
Those who do not have
hands or legs live too.

149
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,450
It is clear that the body
is not what makes a human.

150
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,750
The ones who loses his energy

151
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,390
or loses his consciousness
lives as well.

152
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,850
Therefore it is clear
that a man's unconscious form

153
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,820
isn't the body either.

154
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,390
The one who explores within
himself in this way...

155
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,750
'I am neither the 'Indriyas'*, nor the body'
*Indriyadhisthana: the prime location of sensory perception (gayanendriyas).

156
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,890
'nor the feelings,
nor the thoughts'

157
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,320
'nor am I the thoughts.'

158
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,650
The one who understands this

159
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,360
finally understands himself
in the form of a soul.

160
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,160
What is the purpose of a soul,
Krishna?

161
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,620
When the creation
was partitioned

162
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,990
and when man and nature
were created

163
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,160
then the man, that is the
fragment of God became a soul

164
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,020
and dwelled within every
entity of creation.

165
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,560
That soul was surrounded
by desire and darkness, Arjun.

166
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,120
Awakening from that
slumber of desire

167
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,550
and understanding oneself
as the fragment of God

168
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,680
is the duty, purpose and

169
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,620
the goal of a soul.

170
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,360
But Krishna, if every soul
is a fragment of God

171
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,460
are progress and hindrance
controlled by God himself?

172
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,630
Just as a jewel lying in dirt
does not shimmer

173
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,120
similarly

174
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,220
the soul that is surrounded by
creation's 24 entities learns

175
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,320
that it is the fragment of God.

176
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,990
Very often souls assume that
their bodies are everything.

177
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,460
That they are different
from the body itself

178
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,460
is never known to them.

179
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,060
The joy, sorrow, smell, taste,
etcetera that the body senses

180
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,020
they assume them
to be their experiences

181
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,260
and they never strive
for change.

182
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,860
The souIs that do not
strive towards change

183
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,990
and are constantly
committing injustice

184
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,490
punishing them to awaken them
is inevitable.

185
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,150
You better comprehend this
as well, Arjun

186
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,090
that you are not a body
but a mere soul.

187
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,490
Every warrior seen
in this battlefield

188
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,050
isn't what you think he is.

189
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,290
They have all dwelt within
a body for a time period.

190
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,010
Their bodies shall die

191
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,260
But they are all immortal!

192
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,120
They shall assume new bodies
again.

193
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,950
Until they do not know
themselves as pure souls

194
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,860
until they give up injustice and
imbibe justice into themselves

195
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,150
they shall continue to be born
and die.

196
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,590
This is the first lesson of 'Bramha Vidya',* Arjun!
*Knowledge of the mantra/absolute.

197
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,930
The one who is born
shall surely die.

198
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,050
And the one who dies

199
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,220
shall surely be born again.

200
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,030
This great knowledge is called 'Sankya yoga'!*
*Samkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities; Purusa (consciousness) and prakriti (phenomenal realm of matter). Jiva is that state in which purusa is bonded to prakriti through the glue of desire, and the end of this bondage is moksha.

201
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
What are justice and injustice,
Krishna?

202
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,790
The path treading which a man
sees himself as a soul

203
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,020
and knows himself
to be a fragment of God...

204
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,790
That path is called justice.

205
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,360
When a man and knows himself
to be a fragment of God

206
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,310
he has an epiphany

207
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,860
that creation is God

208
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,520
and God is creation.

209
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,320
There is no difference
between creation and God!

210
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,050
The human who comprehends this

211
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,060
isn't cruel and harsh towards

212
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,020
other humans and animals.

213
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,890
He knows that amputating
an organ causes pain

214
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,820
not just to that organ.

215
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,250
The pain is experienced
by the entire body.

216
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,660
Similarly, when one human
feels pain

217
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,290
the entire world
experiences that pain.

218
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,990
As long as even a single human
is suffering in this world

219
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,660
no one can feel true pleasure
to the fullest until then.

220
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,980
When upon knowing this
a human mind

221
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,020
is filled with compassion

222
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,350
it is called justice.

223
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,390
When one is under the influence
of 'Tamas' 'Guna'

224
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,390
he becomes harsh, cruel and
selfish towards others!

225
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,910
Just for the sake of his
perceived pleasure

226
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,820
he inflicts sorrow upon others.

227
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,080
He cannot grow closer
towards God.

228
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,050
Therefore

229
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,490
injustice is the path that
leads away from God.

230
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,290
Therefore, injustice is another
name for ignorance.

231
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,180
So, one needs to feel pity
towards an ignorant one.

232
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,880
What is the purpose
of punishment?

233
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,850
When an ignorant one
is unwilling

234
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,980
to know the value of knowledge

235
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,520
and is unwilling to even glance
at knowledge

236
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,490
then punishment is compassion

237
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,620
even towards him
and towards others as well.

238
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,480
For the creation's progress
to be always towards God

239
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,180
is inevitable!

240
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,750
But at times situations arise

241
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,910
when ignorance, desire
and injustice grow

242
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,750
and justice in the world
is at the brink of extinction

243
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,280
and the world is devoid
of justice

244
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,960
compassion and truth
are both destroyed.

245
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,050
In order for the forthcoming
generations to get justice

246
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,050
slaying unjust ones today

247
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,890
and re-establishing justice
is inevitable!

248
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,150
Today is a similar situation,
Arjun!

249
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,810
And the duty to establish
justice is yours!

250
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,190
Hence overcome your weakness

251
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,060
and prepare for this battle!

252
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,150
But murders shall occur
at my hands, Krishna!

253
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,920
If lives are ended by me

254
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,250
won't that destroy
the compassion within me?

255
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,150
And if compassion
is the basis of justice

256
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,950
won't my soul become unjust?

257
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,420
The limit of justice
is surely created.

258
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,060
But the limit of actions
isn't created, Arjun.

259
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,980
The difference between
actions and deeds

260
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,650
is necessary to be understood.

261
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,850
All deeds are actions,
but all actions aren't deeds.

262
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,690
A deed is an action

263
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,020
for which an outcome
is expected.

264
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,890
When one carries out a deed

265
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,960
expecting pleasure,
wealth and praise

266
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,990
he is bound by the outcome
of that action.

267
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,290
When a deed is performed with
an expectation of an outcome

268
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,150
it is called 'Sakam Karma Yoga'.*
*Self-centred action.

269
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,760
And when a deed is carried out
without expecting an outcome

270
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,290
it is called 'Nishkaam Karma Yoga'.*
*Self-less or desireless action: action performed without any expectation of fruits or results, and the central tenet of Karma Yoga path to Liberation.

271
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,650
This is the very reason
he has to be born repeatedly.

272
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,850
In reality a man isn't
bound by a deed.

273
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,250
The expectations linked to
that deed is what bounds him.
