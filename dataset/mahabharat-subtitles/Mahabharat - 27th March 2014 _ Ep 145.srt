1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,250
I'm sure Shakuni is
concocting a plot

2
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,250
on the pretext of celebrations.

3
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,210
I suggest that
we go to Hastinapur.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,020
The one who is plotting

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,080
would get a hard blow
of my fist.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,150
He would tremble in fear then.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,090
Dices can be an answer
in the game of gambling.

8
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,120
We won't be able to resort
to a fight there.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,250
But when uncle has
suggested us

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,150
not to accept the invitation

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,090
why should we go to Hastinapur
and fight with them.

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,250
A King can never refuse
for a fight and its initiation.

13
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,180
A ruling King can always express
his helplessness, Yudhisthir.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,990
Tell them,
that you don't have time.

15
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,140
No, uncle.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,060
Uncle Dhritarashtra
is a father figure for me.

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,080
His invitation
is an order for me.

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,040
But, My King

19
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,090
the way to an unknown domain

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,210
is all the more difficult.

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,180
When we don't know about
the plans of King of Gandhar

22
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,150
how are we going
to counter it?

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Plans?

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,020
What can be his plan, Panchali?

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,050
Maybe, his eyes are
set on our property.

26
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,160
Maybe, he wants to
reign our kingdom.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,110
He can take it all
if that's what he wants.

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,050
Do we give up on our rights

29
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,920
just because someone's
plotting against us?

30
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,180
Do we give up on our kingdom

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,980
which we have built after
much hard work?

32
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,150
This isn't just, brother.

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,920
Bheem, no one has
actual rights on this land

34
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,050
and we are no exception.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Just the way
a fish inhales water

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,110
and then exhales it.

37
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,020
Neither does it accepts
water into its system

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
nor does it reject it.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,890
In the same way, human beings
own a piece of land while alive

40
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,080
but eventually,
have to leave it behind.

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,850
We were born in the jungle

42
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,090
and are now,
ruling this kingdom.

43
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,120
Maybe, in future,
we go back to the jungle.

44
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,920
This kingdom isn't ours
for a lifetime

45
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,080
but our pride is

46
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,890
and so is our self-confidence.

47
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,020
We can't let go of our pride
and self-confidence

48
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,940
in the wake of a battle.

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,850
It's not just about
the kingdom, My King.

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,080
I fear

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,020
that if in this game
we play to protect our honour

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,850
we will lose our piousness.

53
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,090
And if we protect our piousness

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,950
we will lose everything
that we have.

55
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,890
If we protect our piousness,
Panchali

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,820
we will be able to get back
all that we lose.

57
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,010
Even if we lose this kingdom

58
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,020
we will build a new kingdom
somewhere else.

59
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,860
But I can't refuse
uncle Dhritarashtra's order.

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,980
Uncle

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,780
I will definitely go
to Hastinapur.

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,820
And if uncle Dhritashtra
orders me

63
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,920
I will surely gamble.

64
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,790
They have entered this place

65
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,760
just the way a fawn

66
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,860
enters the mouth of a python.

67
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,720
They have come with their pride

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,910
just to have it

69
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,950
squashed by us.

70
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,790
Their arrival was inevitable,
my child.

71
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,820
When you make the right move

72
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,910
you can compel others

73
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,720
to give

74
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,810
in to your wish.

75
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,660
Let's go and welcome them.

76
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,820
While welcoming the
sovereign king, Yudhisthir

77
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
don't forget

78
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,810
to be humble
to him.

79
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,880
For the last time.

80
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,720
May you be happy always.

81
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
It's a tradition

82
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,550
that wherever
a sovereign king goes

83
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,660
his wish should be asked for,
firstly.

84
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,660
So tell me,
what your wish is.

85
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
King"

86
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,650
I just have one wish, uncle.

87
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,710
For a moment, forget that
I'm a sovereign king

88
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,680
and let me take
your blessings.

89
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,710
No, dear.

90
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,820
A sovereign king
never seeks anyone's blessings.

91
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,650
A coconut tree,
though, is important

92
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,710
it's the coconut
that comes to use

93
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,720
and used in prayers.

94
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,580
In the same way,
neither a father

95
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,650
nor an uncle
is as important as

96
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,690
a sovereign king.

97
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,790
In more than 500 years,
none of the kings from

98
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,650
Kuru dynasty could get
the title of a sovereign king.

99
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,650
I'm really proud of you, dear.

100
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,690
But, today just let me be a
happy and a proud uncle.

101
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,650
I seek your blessings, King.

102
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,620
May you be happy,
brother Duryodhan.

103
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,620
'Order brother-in-law Duryodhan
to drop his weapons.'

104
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,490
'To take away weapons
from a warrior'

105
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
'is deemed
a fitting punishment.'

106
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,610
'Confiscate brother Duryodhan,
brother Dushyashan'

107
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,420
'and King of Anga's weapons.'

108
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,490
I seek your blessings, Queen.

109
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,490
May God bless you,
Prince Duryodhan.

110
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,490
The court of Hastinapur
may be inferior

111
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,620
when compared to your
pride and rights.

112
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,620
Do we need to spruce up

113
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,350
Hastinapur's court for you or...

114
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,640
Do we need to spruce up

115
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,870
Hastinapur's court for you or...

116
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,810
Or?

117
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,770
Or

118
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,670
do we need to apologise
to you

119
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,780
if something lacks
in our hospitality?

120
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,640
King!

121
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,770
Please come in,
if you wish to.

122
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,770
We have arranged a grand
welcome for you

123
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,640
at the court of Hastinapur.

124
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,770
Shall we, dear?

125
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Let's go, uncle.

126
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,740
Welcome.

127
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Queen...

128
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,610
If you wish, we can first
visit the family deity's temple.

129
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,770
After which, you can
enter the court.

130
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
As you say,
Queen mother.

131
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,540
Is the snake letting go
of its venom

132
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,770
or is it the venom that's
forsaking the snake?

133
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,580
Why are we being given
so much respect?

134
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,680
A sacrificial lamb is fed well
before it could be sacrificed.

135
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,540
We should stay alert, brother.

136
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Don't worry, Nakul.

137
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,610
As long as Grand Sire
Bhishma is with us

138
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,610
he won't let any harm
befall us.

139
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,670
Let's proceed.

140
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,710
What happened, Sahdev?

141
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,540
I'm getting
a sense of foreboding.

142
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,630
Today, this court is going
to witness an injustice

143
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,510
that has never taken place
in the history of mankind.

144
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,400
Don't worry, Sahdev.

145
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,380
Grand Sire, Sir Drona,
uncle Dhritarashtra

146
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,570
and uncle Vidur are here.

147
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,480
Queen mother's here
and so is our mother.

148
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,410
On seeing an injustice
taking place

149
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,370
they won't remain silent.

150
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Brother Arjun

151
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,370
adversity is when

152
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,570
the rope you hold
for your support

153
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
actually turns out
to be a snake.

154
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,370
I fear

155
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,430
that everyone's going
to be a silent spectator today.

156
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,700
Brother Arjun

157
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,700
adversity is when

158
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,860
the rope you hold
for your support

159
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,660
actually turns out
to be a snake.

160
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,660
I fear

161
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,760
that everyone's going
to be a silent spectator today.

162
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,760
Grand Sire, you look worried.

163
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,830
Yes, Vidur.

164
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,730
I'm worried about the fact
that in this game of gambling

165
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,830
Shakuni is surely
going to cheat.

166
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,660
Looking at the splendour
of Indraprastha

167
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,720
Duryodhan is envious.

168
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,590
He wants
the kingdom of Pandavas

169
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,790
by hook or crook.

170
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,560
The reason for my worry
is the same, Grand Sire.

171
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,760
Grand Sire

172
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,790
please try and stop this game
of gambling from taking place.

173
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,660
My rights and my powers
have been subdued, Vidur.

174
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,760
A throne made of sand
remains intact

175
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,530
until someone sits on it.

176
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,560
But Pandavas

177
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,530
with their hard work

178
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,570
have built Indraprastha.

179
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,730
And I...

180
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,500
I won't let anyone deprive
them of their rights.

181
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,730
I must speak to Duryodhan.

182
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,690
The final say should

183
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,660
be ours today, uncle.

184
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,560
I'm sure it will be, my child.

185
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,520
The Pandavas would
be defeated so badly

186
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,530
that they would never be able
to come to terms with it.

187
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,430
Their kingdom, their army

188
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,460
their property...

189
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,670
Take it all
away from them, uncle.

190
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Is that it?

191
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,620
My children

192
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm going to

193
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,620
crush their pride.

194
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,560
Those who don't

195
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,460
have a reason

196
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,690
to be proud of themselves

197
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,400
are actually

198
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,590
the ones who are defeated.

199
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,460
How are we going
to do that, uncle?

200
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,400
We will make them
your servants.

201
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,490
That won't suffice, uncle.

202
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,620
We will make their wife
our handmaiden.

203
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,460
She made us part with our
weapons in their court

204
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,560
we are going to unclothe her

205
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,500
in our court, before all.
