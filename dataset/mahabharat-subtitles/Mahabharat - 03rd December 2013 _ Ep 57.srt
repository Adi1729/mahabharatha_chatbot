1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,000
When a mother cries
because of her son

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,190
a strange agony pervades
her emotions and even her laugh

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,130
gets tainted by it, mother.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,160
Look.

5
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,170
I am smiling now.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,070
Now, quit feeling sad.

7
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,930
Today, you have made me
very happy, son.

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,970
Sit down here with me.

9
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,130
I will feed you myself.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,070
Today, even grandfather Bhishma
was deeply hurt because of me.

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,970
Shall I go and apologize to him?

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,090
Then I shall return for my meal.

13
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,070
'You decided to forge an enmity
with Anga Pradesh?'

14
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,130
'You have given Hastinapur
an invitation to a war!'

15
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,890
'Prince Arjun'

16
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,060
'you must wash the feet
of His Highness Karna'

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,100
'and ask him for forgiveness.'

18
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,090
'Pardon me, King of Anga.'

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,930
Greetings, grandfather.

20
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,900
What happened at the banquet
today was inappropriate, Arjun.

21
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,930
I am here to apologize
to you, grandfather.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,090
Why should you apologize?

23
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,900
What I did was inappropriate.

24
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,060
What Dhritarashtra did
was inappropriate.

25
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,000
To take your and Karna's
personal differences

26
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,940
and to colour it with politics
was utterly inappropriate.

27
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,840
But Vidur and I
kept quiet.

28
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,830
I am not angry with either
you or uncle, grandfather.

29
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,990
I understand your dilemma.

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,960
No, Arjun.

31
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,800
You do not understand.

32
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,930
You do not understand...

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,970
When offering greetings to a Shiv Lingam*
*Linga/rock symbol of Shiva.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,800
the ants crawling over it
also receive the greetings.

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,030
Similar is the state of people
who serve the throne.

36
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,960
If an undeserving person
is the king of a place

37
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,900
then anything done by the people
who serve the throne

38
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,970
can never be appropriate
in totality.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,860
That is why, it is important

40
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,770
to coronate a deserving person
the King of Hastinapur.

41
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,770
But if

42
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,870
tomorrow at the court,
Dhritarashtra

43
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,730
takes an inappropriate decision

44
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,700
then the Kuru kingdom

45
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,890
will see all its hopes crumble.

46
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,840
Grandfather
if you allow us

47
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,800
then at any given point
of time, us brothers

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,870
can have our eldest brother
coronated as the King.

49
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,800
All of you are indeed
great warriors

50
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,740
but if you draw a weapon
against Hastinapur

51
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,860
then I shall stop you
from doing so.

52
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,700
And until the Almighty
himself aids you

53
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,860
you cannot defeat me.

54
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,890
Right now, I

55
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,770
see only one way out.

56
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,640
Pray to the Almighty, Arjun.

57
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,630
Pray to Him.

58
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,670
Whenever man is faced
with a dreadful situation

59
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
he prays to the Almighty.

60
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
He pleads to the Lord to aid him
overcome the situation.

61
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,560
But

62
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,660
what does this prayer
truly mean?

63
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,660
Have we ever thought about it?

64
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,740
The meaning of a prayer

65
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,700
is to take one's apprehensions,
one's worries

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,740
one's resolutions, one's options
and one's plans

67
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,690
and place them at
the feet of the Almighty.

68
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,730
In other words

69
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,660
instead of worrying about
what one's actions will yield

70
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,670
acting righteously

71
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,630
and deeming the Almighty's plan
as one's fate...

72
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,770
Is this not praying?

73
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,830
But is understanding
the Almighty's plan

74
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,730
ever possible?

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,730
Those plans always culminate
into the results of our actions.

76
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,670
But if someone
stops acting altogether

77
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,770
can it be termed as praying?

78
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,530
The truth is,
actions equate to life.

79
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,670
And keeping oneself
from coveting results

80
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,670
is praying truly.

81
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,670
If a prayer

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,490
impedes one's actions
and prevents man from acting

83
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,540
then is it a prayer or defeat?

84
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,800
Think about it.

85
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,760
Greetings, father.

86
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,730
You seem very happy, son.

87
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,720
Yes, father.

88
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,600
I am very happy!

89
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,530
You had taken an oath
that you will make me King.

90
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,500
But father

91
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,540
to aid me and the generations
that come after me

92
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,500
have a prosperous future

93
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,690
was not something
you had ever planned.

94
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,530
I have made such a plan.

95
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,700
And how is that, son?

96
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,630
Father, when my friend
Duryodhan becomes King

97
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,430
he will aid me
in protecting my kingdom.

98
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,440
I made him promise me today.

99
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,640
An incapable person

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,470
is always the first
to make promises.

101
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,530
What do you think, father?

102
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,430
Will my friend not become King?

103
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,630
No, he will not.

104
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,590
He will not.

105
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,470
The Prince will be crowned
based on his competence.

106
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,590
And he not becoming King

107
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,440
is in the best interest of
the Kuru kingdom and Hastinapur.

108
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,560
But father

109
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,400
tomorrow, King Dhritarashtra

110
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,600
will declare his son
as the crowned Prince.

111
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,370
Are you telling the truth?

112
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,570
Who gave him the right to do so?

113
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,630
Father

114
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,560
how can you question
the rights of a King?

115
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
No.

116
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,570
I am questioning my own rights.

117
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,590
You will not understand.

118
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,590
Go to bed.

119
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,670
Today, Hastinapur is celebrating

120
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,440
the coronation ceremony
of its Prince!

121
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,400
Sculptor

122
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,500
let my idol be so high

123
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,510
that the other idols

124
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,370
look smaller in comparison

125
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,510
because I am to become
the most able

126
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,470
and most powerful King of India.

127
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,410
But Prince, to make
the idols of the same height

128
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,600
is tradition.

129
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,440
The idol of a new King

130
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
cannot be taller than
that of his ancestors.

131
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,540
A King's order is more important
than tradition, sculptor!

132
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,530
I shall go right away and get
the permission of His Highness.

133
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,500
Stop, Dusshasan!

134
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,530
Why should we break
tradition unnecessarily?

135
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,510
The idol cannot be too high

136
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,500
but

137
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,470
it can be at an elevated place.

138
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,440
That was a splendid suggestion,
friend Ashwatthama.

139
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,440
Now, the question is, what should
be kept beneath this idol?

140
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,500
Have my idol placed
below yours, friend.

141
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,340
And have your idol
mounted on my shoulders.

142
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,410
That cannot be.

143
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,380
I stand by my friends,
King of Anga.

144
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,440
And I stand on the shoulders
of my enemies.

145
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,280
Brother, then there should be

146
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,500
five idols beneath yours.

147
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,340
Why base them on five humans?

148
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,330
Those idols can also be
of five animals.

149
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,330
And one of them
will be a donkey, friend.

150
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,300
With a bow and arrows
in his hands.

151
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,460
Bheem!

152
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,360
Gandhari.

153
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,330
What is this, brother?

154
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,520
Offering to the dead.

155
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,490
Do you not know what it is?

156
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,450
And which ungratified spirit
is offered iron, brother?

157
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,360
An ungratified spirit
is offered wheat flour.

158
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,480
But an ungratified desire

159
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,420
is offered iron.

160
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,520
Today, my ungratified desire
shall finally be fulfilled.

161
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,530
Today, my nephew

162
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,290
will become the crowned
Prince of Hastinapur.

163
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,380
And very soon

164
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,420
Hastinapur

165
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,320
will transform into Gandhar!

166
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,380
In other words

167
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,320
by making Duryodhan
the crowned Prince

168
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,260
you wish to destroy
the kingdom of Hastinapur?

169
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,260
You are foolish,
beloved Gandhari.

170
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,380
I will not destroy
the kingdom of Hastinapur.

171
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,450
I will destroy
only the arrogance

172
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,250
and the unjust values
of this dynasty.

173
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,260
This empire may be called
the kingdom of Kuru

174
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,360
but it will become

175
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,290
Gandhar!

176
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,260
Because its governance

177
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,260
will be based upon Gandhar's
rules and principles.

178
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,290
Brother...
- Sister

179
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,330
you cannot protest to this

180
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,220
because I am not doing anything

181
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,390
that will harm either
your 100 sons or your husband.

182
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,350
My fight had always

183
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,460
been with the
son of Ganga, Bhishma.

184
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,260
The arrogance with which
he had arrived in Gandhar

185
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,420
will be blown into pieces today.

186
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,260
Today, the son of Ganga, Bhishma

187
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,330
will be defeated!

188
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Forever!

189
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,290
Today, in Hastinapur

190
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,230
the Prince of the Kuru Kingdom
will be announced!

191
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,350
King Dhritarashtra
is making his entrance!

192
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,350
All hail King Dhritarashtra!

193
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,260
All hail King Dhritarashtra!

194
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,160
All hail King Dhritarashtra!

195
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,350
All hail King Dhritarashtra!

196
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,290
All hail King Dhritarashtra!

197
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,160
All hail King Dhritarashtra!

198
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,190
Ministers and people
in the court

199
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,320
all of you must be eager
to know the King's decision

200
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,250
but, Your Majesty

201
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,160
before you announce
the crowned Prince

202
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,190
if the great Bhishma
blesses the Princes

203
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,150
then the education of
the Princes will be complete.

204
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,160
But only if you allow it.

205
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,220
Certainly.

206
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,190
Uncle shall address the court.

207
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,020
What is he about to say?

208
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,250
Apart from blessing us

209
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,150
what else can he say, uncle?

210
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,250
Listening to one's enemy

211
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,080
makes not only the people
who hear it repent

212
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,250
but also the ones who don't,
repent as well.
