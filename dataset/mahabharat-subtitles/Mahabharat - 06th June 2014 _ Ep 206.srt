1
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,730
'To emerge victorious in this war,

2
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,790
we must devise a stratagem to take down

3
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,980
His Majesty Bhisma.'

4
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,560
'On the day of the war.'

5
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,360
Madhav!

6
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,620
Your chariot's here, Parth.

7
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,560
Along with the charioteer.

8
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,590
No, Madhav.

9
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,330
You can't become my charioteer.

10
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,520
Do you not believe me, Parth?

11
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,290
I am very proficient with this.

12
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,450
No, Madhav.

13
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,460
You are a respected person.

14
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,290
I can't let you become a charioteer.

15
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,450
It doesn't matter, Parth.

16
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,430
If you feel like it

17
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,490
then consider me

18
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
just sitting in front of you.

19
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,430
As the horses are in my care

20
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,330
I'll never let your mind waver, Parth.

21
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,360
In honesty and deception...

22
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,530
Between truth and immorality...

23
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,460
Every time your mind
loses focus

24
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,520
it would be my duty

25
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,430
to bring you to the 
right course again.

26
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,330
Both in custody of your chariot

27
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,420
or your life,

28
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,390
I am proficient in both, Parth.

29
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,220
All hail Mahadev!

30
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,230
All hail Mahadev!

31
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,190
Karna.

32
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,130
I will wait for you
on the battlefield.

33
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,130
Until you draw your bowstring

34
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,120
we will not achieve victory.

35
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,130
I also wait for that day, 
friend.

36
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,230
I may be physically here

37
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,390
but my soul

38
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,130
will accompany you in the battlefield.

39
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,020
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!

40
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,960
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!

41
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,200
May God bless you
with victory, sons.

42
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,130
May your war skills
will make you immortal.

43
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,960
I bless you all.

44
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,960
Do not worry about me, mother.

45
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,990
Sire!

46
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,030
I assure you that this day

47
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,190
I'll be back with victory
from the battlefield.

48
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Dear...

49
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,090
I hope you win.

50
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,050
Your victory in this war is decided.

51
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,000
Accept my last greeting, mother.

52
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,920
No one realizes

53
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,120
that at the end of this war

54
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,020
who will greet the god of death,

55
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,930
and who will go through life

56
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,060
with memories of the war.

57
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,020
People of Kuru along with the Arya clan

58
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,060
including women, children,
pottery, blacksmith,

59
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,050
and farmers.

60
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,100
All will survive, my son.

61
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,960
to have pleasures in life.

62
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,100
Your enemy is also
enemy to society.

63
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,960
Have no mercy on them.

64
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,860
Fill the vessel of god Bhairav* with blood, my child.
*Bhairava or Kala Bhairava is the fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.

65
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,870
Fill the vessel of god Bhairav 
with blood, my child.

66
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,680
All hail Mahadev!
- All hail Mahadev!

67
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Order the attack,
brother Yudhishtir.

68
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,570
Charioteer,

69
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,730
take the chariot to the front.

70
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,960
Yudhishtir.
Are you already scared?

71
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,000
Repent for your actions and 
accept your punishment,

72
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,930
Dusshasan,

73
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,740
time to ask forgiveness 
has long gone.

74
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,000
But if you want to save
your soldiers' life

75
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,800
then surrender yourself

76
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,900
and accept the death penalty,
brother Yudhishtir.

77
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,800
At least your righteousness will 
live longer than you.

78
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,800
Grandsire Bhishma!

79
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,860
Do not forget

80
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,730
that you had taken oath

81
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,930
for the throne of Hastinapur.

82
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,800
Uncle speaks right, grandsire.

83
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,940
Do not bless me.

84
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,960
But before this war begins

85
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,790
I will not give up my ethic.

86
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,890
Therefore, by greeting you

87
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,890
and our teacher...

88
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,700
me and my brothers

89
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,790
here to ask for your permissions
for war,

90
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,760
Grandsire,

91
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,670
like birds build their nests

92
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,700
on branches in the shade of trees
and live happily

93
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,670
we've been living in a safe place 
because of you.

94
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,670
Every part of us is indebted 
to you.

95
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,630
Today...

96
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,900
we have been forced to take up 
arms against you.

97
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,700
Like aquatic animals trying to 
drink up dry the entire ocean.

98
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,700
Grandsire,

99
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,790
give us permission to war,

100
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,630
or order us to surrender
our weapons.
