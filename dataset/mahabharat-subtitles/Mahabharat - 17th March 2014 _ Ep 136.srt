1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,390
Brother had said

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,390
where the Sudarshana Chakra
fails to work

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,450
is where the melody of flute does.

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,510
He had also told me

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,580
that only if I bear
humility in my heart

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,410
will I be able to win
over the High Queen.

7
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,580
Sister-in-law.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
No!

9
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,620
You cannot address me
by that term.

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm not addressing you
as 'sister-in-law'

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,360
but you will address me as one.

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,350
Sister-in-law!

13
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,310
Please pardon my husband.

14
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,360
I have given you

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,350
all that I had with me.

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,590
Now, please allow us
to enter the city.

17
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,320
Unfortunate is he

18
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,360
who cannot revere
Madhav's flute.

19
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,490
Do proceed to the gates
of the city.

20
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,460
Let me make preparations
to welcome both of you.

21
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,420
"This is such a complex
matter of rights."

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,320
"This is a matter of honour."

23
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,450
"It seems to be"

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,390
"on the verge of success."

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,450
"My heart must remain steadfast"

26
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,260
"and this is a vow
I must fulfil."

27
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,220
"My heart will remain steadfast"

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,450
"and this is the purpose
of my life."

29
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,290
May you be blessed
with a son, Subhadra.

30
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,320
May the Almighty make your son

31
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,410
inherit the glory and valour

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,220
his father possesses.

33
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,290
Panchali...

34
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,150
I have wronged you.

35
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,410
I hope you will pardon me.

36
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
I've accepted the peculiarities
of my fate, My Lord

37
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,280
but my heartache will fade away

38
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,350
the day I comprehend
the meaning of such fate.

39
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,280
Madhav had ordered me
to get married, Panchali.

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,220
The future of the entire
Aryan region

41
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,120
rested on this marriage.

42
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,190
Madhav had told me so.

43
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,380
And brother Balaram had said...

44
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,060
I am not asking you
the reason, My Lord.

45
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,320
I wish to know what it means.

46
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,120
Man decides why
he does certain things

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,150
but its meaning...

48
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,120
Its meaning is decided
by the Almighty.

49
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,220
It meant only one thing...

50
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,110
The subjects of the entire
Aryan region

51
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,090
deserve to be happy
and contented

52
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,190
and free from exploitation.

53
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,090
And unrighteousness needs
to be eradicated from the world.

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,150
All this is possible

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,110
only when brother Yudhishthira

56
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,250
becomes the emperor
of the Aryan region

57
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,280
and you

58
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,050
become the Empress
of the Aryan region.

59
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,050
Mother's orders

60
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,210
Madhav's wish

61
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,250
and our efforts

62
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,120
are propelling us
towards this goal.

63
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,150
If that is the case, My Lord

64
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,160
then my heartache will fade away

65
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,220
the day when, in order
to realise this meaning

66
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,110
you will take the first step.

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
The road to the 'Rajsuya Yajna'
of Indraprastha

68
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,990
has many obstacles in it.

69
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,050
Please begin to get
rid of them, My Lord.

70
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,950
Uncle...

71
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,990
We must approach
Shishupal of Chedi for aid.

72
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,060
He is an enemy
of Vasudeva Krishna.

73
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,990
No, my child.
No.

74
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,180
Even if you assemble
an army of monkeys

75
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,120
you will not be
able to fight a lion.

76
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,050
Shishupal is foolish.

77
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,120
He deems verbal abuses
to be weapons.

78
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,180
Krishna can crush him
in a single moment.

79
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,110
The Yadavas are afraid

80
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,020
only of King Jarasandha.

81
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,060
Krishna had killed
his own uncle Kansa.

82
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,120
Kansa was the son-in-law
of Jarasandha.

83
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,050
In order to exact his revenge

84
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,990
King Jarasandha had attacked
the Yadavas several times

85
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,960
and left them terrorised.

86
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,910
In the end, the Yadavas
had to leave Mathura

87
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,910
and flee to Dwaraka.

88
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,850
My child, you are not acquainted
with King Jarasandha's might.

89
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,980
But, uncle...

90
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,880
Why would Jarasandha help us?

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,860
We are not going
to approach him for help.

92
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,850
We are going to seek his refuge.

93
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,060
I, the Crown Prince
of Hastinapur

94
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,790
am to seek his refuge?

95
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,790
Indeed, my child!

96
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,050
Indeed.

97
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,990
The climbers of a forest
seek the refuge of a tree

98
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,860
and then, drain the nutrients
of that very tree.

99
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,980
This is politics.

100
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,890
If you wish to conquer

101
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,910
the entire Aryan region someday
and become its emperor

102
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,050
then you must

103
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,050
seek the refuge
of King Jarasandha today.

104
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,920
If you wish to defeat Krishna

105
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,020
and stop the 'Rajsuya Yajna'
of Indraprastha

106
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,920
then only King Jarasandha
will make that possible.

107
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,920
If Jarasandha kills the Yadavas

108
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,850
then how would it
benefit us, uncle?

109
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,810
If you cannot break a stick

110
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,690
then you must

111
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,680
cleave it

112
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,690
right through the middle.

113
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,750
If the Pandavas

114
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,890
and the Yadavas

115
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,880
are separated

116
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,820
then breaking them

117
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,910
will be easier.

118
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,910
He is the only person

119
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,690
who can make
the entire Aryan region

120
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,760
shudder at his very mention

121
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,750
because Jarasandha

122
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,690
cannot be killed.

123
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,940
Because Jarasandha

124
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,080
cannot be killed.

125
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,850
Cannot be killed?

126
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,070
How can that be possible, uncle?

127
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,110
Jarasandha's father,
King Brihadratha

128
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,140
had two wives

129
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,910
but no children.

130
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,920
The Great Sage Chandakaushika

131
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,070
gave King Brihadratha a fruit

132
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,970
in order to bear children.

133
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,020
The King divided
that fruit into two

134
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,970
and gave one half
to each of his wives.

135
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,820
Both his wives gave birth

136
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,920
to two halves of a child.

137
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,040
It was then that the King

138
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,980
prayed to the female ogre Jara.

139
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,020
The ogre Jara used her powers

140
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,070
to join the two halves

141
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,080
which brought the child to life.

142
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,080
Since Jara had amalgamated
the two halves

143
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,010
the child
came to be known

144
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,970
as Jarasandha.

145
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

146
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,940
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

147
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

148
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,810
Come forward and demonstrate
your might!

149
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,810
Come forth!

150
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

151
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

152
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,970
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

153
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,940
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

154
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,940
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

155
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,970
He cannot be killed
with any weapon.

156
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,980
The secret to killing

157
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,770
King Jarasandha

158
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,740
is known only by the ogre Jara

159
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,870
and the Almighty.

160
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,940
No one else knows about it.

161
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,720
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

162
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,850
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

163
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

164
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,680
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

165
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,840
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

166
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,750
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

167
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,910
All hail Emperor Jarasandha...
- Hail!

168
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,680
Let's go, my child.

169
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,840
Let's go, my child!

170
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,880
Only after consuming poison
did Lord Shiva

171
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,680
earn the right of bearing
the crescent moon on his head.

172
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,610
Gulp down this poison of insult.

173
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,710
Hail the Emperor!

174
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,570
Greetings, King Jarasandha!

175
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,630
Emperor Jarasandha!

176
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,540
So, you are the one

177
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,540
who had approached
Vasudeva Krishna

178
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,510
to marry his sister.

179
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,640
Pardon the heart of the Prince,
Your Highness.

180
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,640
He fell in love.

181
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,440
That is a lie,
King of Gandhar!

182
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,440
I have heard a lot
about your feats.

183
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,500
All your actions
reek of politics

184
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,470
and not love.

185
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,480
Because your political ploys
were unsuccessful there

186
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,640
you have come to Magadha
to achieve success.

187
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,480
To me, Emperor Jarasandha.

188
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Your Highness,
when one door closes

189
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,700
one must open another.

190
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,580
That is how rodents behave,
King of Gandhar.

191
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,440
When the entrance
to their shelter gets closed

192
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,600
they scurry in another direction
to dig a new passage.

193
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,470
However, the den of a lion
has only one entrance

194
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,480
and the courage
to block that passage

195
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,600
is possessed by no one!

196
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,400
No one!

197
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,440
Your Highness,
do not let your might

198
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,530
become your terminal point.

199
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,530
We have come to you

200
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,440
with a proposal.

201
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,480
You ought to perform
a 'Rajsuya Yajna.'

202
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,530
The entire army of Hastinapur

203
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,500
and the enemies of the Yadavas

204
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,510
will stand by you.

205
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,410
You ought to declare yourself

206
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,340
the Emperor

207
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,570
of the entire Aryan region.

208
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,410
When one does not have the
strength to fight one's battles

209
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,440
engaging in one is foolishness,
King of Gandhar.

210
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,430
Foolishness!

211
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,480
For all these years

212
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,470
you have fought your own battles

213
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,300
Emperor Jarasandha.

214
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,370
Yet, Vasudeva Krishna is alive

215
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,570
and the Yadavas are prosperous.

216
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,310
Your Highness...

217
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,280
If even one of the flames
goes unextinguished

218
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,310
the wind is deemed weak.

219
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,280
And now, Vasudeva Krishna

220
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,280
has become the sun
from being a flame!

221
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,340
Even taking that cowherd's name
in Magadha is a crime!

222
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,370
So, how dare you praise him!

223
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,400
The three of you shall be
sentenced to death!

224
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,500
Soldiers, arrest them!

225
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,340
Have them beheaded and send
their heads to Krishna!

226
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,470
My darlings...

227
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,430
Surrender yourselves.

228
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,340
Have faith in the gambit
of Shakuni.

229
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,270
Very soon,
the Pandavas

230
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,430
will be unable

231
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,430
to understand the difference
between a door and a wall.

232
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,210
Very soon,
the Pandavas

233
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,400
will be caught

234
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,330
in our web.
