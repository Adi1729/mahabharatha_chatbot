1
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,520
How dare you snatch
the prince's weapon?

2
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,620
Dushasan, you fool!

3
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,660
It isn't courage,
it is training.

4
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,520
Even if the teacher's son
is younger to us

5
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,710
it's right to consider
him as an elder brother.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
Our uncle had said so.

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,580
But he is elder to us in age.

8
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,460
Accept my greetings, friend.

9
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,510
You seem cultured.

10
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,680
I was afraid

11
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,490
that I may have to force
the princes of Hastinapur

12
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,520
to change their attitude.

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,420
What is the pearl on
your forehead?

14
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,520
It is the center of my sharp
brains and limitless powers.

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,450
It's the fruit of the penance
I did in my previous birth.

16
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,610
Due to this

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,620
I will never fall sick
or grow old.

18
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,610
Then being friends with a great
Brahman like you

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,390
will be a blessing to the
future king of Hastinapur.

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,580
My uncle has made all
these arrangements for me.

21
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,610
Hereafter, you will have equal
rights on all these things

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,520
as much as I have.

23
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,510
A lamp burning with
perfumed oil?

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,420
Such great facilities!

25
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,510
Life at the palace is
actually very comfortable.

26
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,390
This is nothing.

27
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,490
The day you become the Royal
teacher of Hastinapur

28
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,460
there will be abundance
of facilities.

29
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,420
Your friend promises you.

30
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,250
Food can be served
on a golden plate

31
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
but one cannot cook in it.

32
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,290
No facilities are allowed
for the students

33
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,220
of this hermitage.

34
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,260
It's human nature

35
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,320
that he wants himself,
his family and his children

36
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,450
to get all the happiness.

37
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
That's why we always
stay away from

38
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,350
hard work and problems.

39
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,250
We try to increase our
comforts and facilities.

40
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,280
Think about your life.

41
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,290
Isn't it true

42
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,250
that we always provide
our children

43
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,220
with comforts and facilities?

44
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,210
But have you ever thought?

45
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,380
How would comforts benefit them?

46
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,390
The ones who are provided
with comforts and facilities

47
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,180
how would their lives be!

48
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,210
Hard work makes the body
healthier.

49
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,350
When our brains encounter
tough challenges

50
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,250
it becomes more radiant.

51
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,220
We have experienced it.

52
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,350
But we tend to forget

53
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,290
that when our heart and
soul experience difficulties

54
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,150
even they become stronger.

55
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,120
It means

56
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,190
whenever we try to keep
our children away

57
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,280
from hard work and sorrow

58
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,320
aren't we actually shutting the
door to happiness for them?

59
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,360
Think about it.

60
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,220
Ashwathama.

61
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,350
Ashwathama!

62
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
Son.

63
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,250
These lovely clothes and gold

64
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,080
why are you putting them
in the fire?

65
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,280
I am following my
father's orders.

66
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,290
Did your father

67
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,190
ask you to burn all the gifts
received from Hastinapur?

68
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,090
But your father had decided
to renounce poverty

69
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,350
for your sake, son.

70
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,120
But not from his heart, mother.

71
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,250
Poverty is still very
dear to him.

72
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,150
I think he wants

73
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,090
me to be miserable and
lead my life begging for alms.

74
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,180
Why is that, mother?

75
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,310
What is the pride in assuming
liquid flour to be milk?

76
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,050
Why does father hate prosperity?

77
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,260
Today, I was being friends with
the prince of Hastinapur.

78
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,090
The prince would be the future
king of Hastinapur.

79
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,120
Beings friends with him

80
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,120
could have filled my life with
all the comforts and facilities.

81
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,090
But father

82
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,280
shut the door of that
friendship for me.

83
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,120
Son, there are four
types of friendship.

84
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,150
The best form of friendship is

85
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,020
where everyone together

86
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,120
with knowledge, devotion
and principles

87
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,050
work hard for the welfare
of one's soul.

88
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,160
The second best form of
friendship is when

89
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,090
all the friends together

90
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,210
think about their families,
dynasty

91
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,120
the society and the
welfare of the nation.

92
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,060
The third is the
friendship of business

93
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,020
where efforts are put
to earn wealth

94
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,210
together.

95
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,990
The last is the friendship
of vices

96
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,190
where attempts are made
only to enjoy.

97
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,020
What kind of a friendship do
you share with the Kuru prince?

98
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,150
What benefits would you derive
from such a friendship?

99
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,050
What have I derived
in life until now

100
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,990
that I can chose?
- Ashwathama!

101
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,220
Don't you talk like that
to your father.

102
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,210
Let him speak, Kripi.

103
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,990
I understand his feelings.

104
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,020
But son, you must remember

105
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,990
he is being friends with you now
because you are

106
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,990
his Guru's son.

107
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:27,990
I trusted such a friendship and
had a bitter experience in life.

108
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,950
You had a bitter experience

109
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,220
because you had huge
expectations, lord.

110
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,950
Ashwathama is only...
- Only?

111
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,210
Are you using the word only?

112
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,180
What does he want?!

113
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,150
The best clothing?

114
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,180
Gold ornaments?

115
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,960
Or does he want to be
served a grand feast every day?

116
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,960
Would he be satisfied with that?

117
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,950
You seem to forget

118
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,010
he is the grandson of
the great sage Bharadwaj

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,960
and the son of the disciple
of the great Parshuram.

120
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,180
He has to become great.

121
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,890
He has a right to the throne.

122
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,920
The throne of Panchal.

123
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,090
I will crown you
king of Panchal.

124
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,010
This is your father's
promise, son.

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,150
It's a promise.

126
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,890
Until I do not crown you
king of Panchal

127
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,950
I won't be able to forget
the humiliation I'd endured.

128
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,890
How would that happen?

129
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,980
Among all the Kuru princes
who is capable of doing this?

130
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,060
Wake up.

131
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,160
Wake up!
- Go away, servant.

132
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,000
Not now.

133
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,000
We will wake up
after four hours.

134
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,160
The rats didn't let us sleep
throughout the night.

135
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,060
Go away.

136
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,230
Wake up!
- Sire!

137
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,000
Wake up, elder brother.
The teacher is here.

138
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,190
Let me sleep. I haven't
completed my sleep yet.

139
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,040
Wake up!
- Sire!

140
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,230
The one who can sleep like a dog
and wake up immediately

141
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,040
is called a student.

142
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,190
Everyone should assemble
in the garden. Quickly!

143
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,090
Students.

144
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,130
A new life begins for
all of you today.

145
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,200
Nothing is more important in
life than getting an education.

146
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,970
The first day of acquiring
knowledge is more important

147
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,160
than any other day in your life.

148
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,160
Today, it will be decided

149
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,130
what will all of your learn
in the coming years

150
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,070
and how much knowledge
you will gain.

151
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,100
There on the branch of the tree

152
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,990
a wooden bird has been placed.

153
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,900
It's eye has to be pierced

154
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,160
with your arrow.

155
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Yudhistir, you are
the eldest of them all

156
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,130
so step forward.

157
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,900
Aim at your target.

158
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,990
What do you see?

159
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,870
I can see a tree, Sire.

160
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,900
The branch on the tree

161
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,870
and I can see the bird
sitting on the branch.

162
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,030
There are other branches

163
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
which has a birds nest on it.

164
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,900
I have to be careful when
I shoot the arrow

165
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,060
that the nest should not fall.

166
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,890
If the branch falls along
with the bird

167
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,070
there is an ant hill down there.

168
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,060
It may break.

169
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,100
I have to be careful
about it too.

170
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,970
That's amazing, dear.

171
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,940
You can see so many
things at a time.

172
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,830
This is the first quality
needed in a good ruler

173
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,040
which is naturally
inculcated in you.

174
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,960
But you cannot become an archer.

175
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,970
Place the bow down
and go back to your place.

176
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,830
Bheem!
Step forward.

177
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,900
Aim at the target.

178
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,000
What do you see?

179
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,870
The elder brother has created
a problem for me, Sire.

180
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,870
Whatever brother had seen,
I see the same things.

181
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,930
And

182
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,000
many fruits.

183
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,770
You could see so many things

184
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,030
but you couldn't see whether
the string on your bow is tied.

185
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Should I tie it?
- Of course.

186
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,840
Go around the entire hermitage
a hundred times.

187
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,000
And then tie the string.
Hurry up!

188
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,770
Duryodhan, step forward.

189
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,730
Aim at your target.

190
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,920
Duryodhan, step forward.

191
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,850
Aim at your target.

192
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,110
What do you see?

193
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,050
I can only see the bird

194
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,090
and the branch of the
tree, Sire.

195
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,890
What should I drop?
The bird or the branch?

196
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,940
The eye of the bird
placed on the branch

197
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,890
has to be pierced in a way

198
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,890
that the bird doesn't
fall from the tree.

199
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,950
How is that possible, Sire?

200
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,890
An attack will surely
have an aftermath.

201
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,950
Until there is no control
on the aftermath

202
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,820
until there is no control on
the level of the aftermath

203
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,890
a warrior doesn't attack.

204
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,890
Place the bow down.

205
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,050
Go back to your place.

206
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,980
That's surprising.

207
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,050
There is no one among
the Kuru princes

208
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,020
who can pierce the bird's eye.

209
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,790
Father had taught
that to me first.

210
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,880
Arjun.

211
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,820
Aim at the target.

212
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,890
What do you see?

213
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,980
I can only see
the bird's eye, Sire.

214
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,950
Shoot the arrow.
