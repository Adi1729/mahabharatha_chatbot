1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,230
Their powers had been snatched
through treachery in this court.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,270
Return their powers to them.

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,290
That will be sufficient.

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,160
Yes! Of course!

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,190
I return the property
and the kingdom of the Pandavas

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,160
right at this moment.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,130
Impossible!

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,070
You have no right to give
away my property, father.

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,190
Duryodhan...

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,030
Keep quiet,
foolish Prince!

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,000
Have mercy on Hastinapur.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,230
Stay quiet.

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,170
Stay quiet!
I would have surely done so.

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,030
Let us assume
that the entire game

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,140
was based on dishonesty
and deceit.

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,140
You must also admit
that you have quietly

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,070
allowed this dishonesty
and deceit to take place.

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,030
Even you admit that all of you

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,140
are to blame as much as I am.

20
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,960
Admit it!

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,160
If this game...

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,040
The rules of this game
were drafted

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,030
by grandsire Bhishma

24
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,030
and both the parties

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,100
had adhered to the rules.

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,160
If the game
was unlawful

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,100
then, all of you
are the culprits.

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,130
If not, then even
I am blameless.

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,930
Is there anyone
present at this court

30
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,930
who can say
that this game

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,990
was based on dishonesty
and deceit?

32
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,190
Is there any such person?

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,990
Silence still reigns
in the court.

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,990
Is no one still doubtful
about their conscience?

35
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,130
Do all of you not know

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,960
that the silence
of a pious person

37
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,970
is considered a greater crime

38
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,130
that the words
of an evil person?

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,130
Remember this,
knowledgeable ones...

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,070
Duryodhan will definitely
be punished for his sins.

41
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,870
But before that

42
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,040
all the people
present at this court

43
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,930
will be punished
for staying silent.

44
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,930
This is a curse

45
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,060
by Draupadi, the one born
from a sacrificial fire.

46
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,800
Mankind has always
subjected women

47
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,890
to exploitation, injustice

48
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,970
and humiliation.

49
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,930
Look around yourself.

50
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,770
Look at all of history.

51
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,960
That's all you will see.

52
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,770
Men's jealousy, lust,
pride, enmity...

53
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,740
Women suffer
the consequences

54
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,770
of all these negative emotions.

55
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,870
Men indulge in battle

56
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,870
but the women of the defeated
kingdoms are tormented.

57
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,740
Men lose their property
while drinking and gambling.

58
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,960
And women?

59
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,730
Women are destined to starve.

60
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,960
Men, overcome
by their pride

61
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,690
restrict women's freedom,
ruin their happiness.

62
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,830
Men get defeated
at the hands of life

63
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,930
and give up their families.

64
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,800
And women?

65
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,840
Women keep struggling

66
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,890
to feed

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
their small children.

68
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,900
Count all the sufferings
in this universe.

69
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,900
It will be very apparent

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,770
that compared to men,
women suffer much more.

71
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,800
What kind of a society
have we created?

72
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,830
Wherein, one half of mankind
relentlessly

73
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,800
exploits the other half.

74
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,890
And those exploited women

75
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,840
give birth to the next
generation of mankind.

76
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,670
Look at the nature.

77
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,840
Those seeds which give birth
to new plants

78
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,770
are surrounded by petals.

79
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,630
They are surrounded
by colour and perfume.

80
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,700
The place where the future
is conceived

81
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,860
should be surrounded
only by beauty, happiness

82
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,660
contentment and respect.

83
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Is that not so?

84
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,630
But by making women suffer

85
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,860
the society makes
the future generations suffer.

86
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,830
Torture, exploitation, pain...

87
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,860
After experiencing such torment

88
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,600
how can women give birth

89
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,830
to happy and healthy progeny?

90
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,600
Hence

91
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,640
whenever any woman
is humiliated

92
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,760
exploited

93
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,730
whenever a woman's hair
is pulled

94
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,670
in some form or the other

95
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,760
the seed of a battle is sown.

96
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,760
In some form or the other,

97
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,670
an epic

98
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,770
begins.

99
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,670
Judge for yourselves.

100
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,790
Do so again and again.

101
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,760
Your Highness

102
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,760
your decision to return
the Pandavas' property

103
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,760
their kingdom

104
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,660
their weapons

105
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
and their freedom

106
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,760
to them, is right.

107
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,700
But even Duryodhan's objection
is justified, Your Highness.

108
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Thus,

109
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,630
I propose a compromise.

110
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,690
If your courtiers permit me

111
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,760
I will tell you about it.

112
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,500
Well?

113
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,530
Tell me quickly.
What is it?

114
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,660
Your Highness

115
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,500
for 13 years, Duryodhan

116
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,530
can claim ownership
of all that he has won.

117
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,670
As a result of their defeat

118
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,640
the Pandavas will spend 13 years

119
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,490
in exile, in the forest.

120
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,540
And when they return from exile

121
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,660
their property

122
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,470
and their kingdom

123
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,470
will be returned to them,

124
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,660
with due respect.

125
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,500
Uncle!

126
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,630
I am right, my child.

127
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,660
I am right!

128
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,660
If you are still not satisfied

129
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,630
then let us
sentence the Pandavas

130
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,400
to 12 years of exile

131
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,430
and 1 year of hiding.

132
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,630
If the Pandavas

133
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,600
are recognised in the last year

134
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,660
then once again

135
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,530
they will have to go through

136
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,570
12 years of exile
and 1 year of hiding.

137
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,360
Now

138
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,630
do not be too greedy,
my child.

139
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,490
I accept this solution.

140
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
If the Pandavas 

141
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,010
are recognised
in the last year

142
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,970
then once again

143
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,870
they will have to go through

144
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,930
12 years of exile
and 1 year of hiding.

145
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,900
Now

146
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,870
do not be too greedy,
my child.

147
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,930
I accept this solution.

148
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,870
Wonderful!

149
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,940
What's the opinion
of the Pandavas? - Uncle!

150
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,100
These Pandavas

151
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,010
are still my slaves.

152
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,070
My decision will be
the ultimate one.

153
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,930
Don't you make that mistake,
Duryodhan.

154
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,960
The curse of a tormented soul

155
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,870
never goes in vain.

156
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,960
You might be afraid of that,
grandsire...

157
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,060
You are going to be punished

158
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,860
for your principles.

159
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,800
I am not.

160
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,000
Father!

161
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,030
I will not free my slaves

162
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,000
or return their property.

163
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,770
But if you command me

164
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,840
I am ready to accept
the compromise

165
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,860
proposed by uncle.

166
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,940
Along with Draupadi

167
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,040
these five Pandavas

168
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,800
will have to stay in exile
in the forest, for 12 years.

169
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,800
In these 12 years

170
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,870
they can't become the allies
of any king

171
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,860
enjoy their hospitality

172
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,870
or build an army.

173
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,870
Which means

174
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,810
that in these 12 years,
these Pandavas

175
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,830
won't be free.

176
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,000
At the end of the exile,
all of them

177
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,870
will have to stay
in complete hiding for a year.

178
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,940
If, in that one year

179
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,910
I see any of the five Pandavas

180
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,870
or their wife

181
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,970
then once again,
they will have

182
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,900
to live in exile
for another 12 years.

183
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,930
So, tell me, father.

184
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,760
What is your decision?

185
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,700
Forgive me, sons of Pandu.

186
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,700
But as per the tradition,
you were the ones

187
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,930
who lost yourselves
to Duryodhan.

188
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,740
Thus...

189
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,860
Thus

190
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,900
I have to accept

191
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,630
Duryodhan's proposal.

192
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,670
I command you.

193
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,660
You five brothers,
along with your wife Draupadi

194
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,710
will have to go through
12 years of exile in the forest

195
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,740
and one year of hiding.

196
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,700
You have to accept it.

197
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,700
As you wish, uncle.

198
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,860
Please permit us
to visit Indraprastha

199
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,860
to meet our subjects
and make certain arrangements.

200
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,630
Permission granted.

201
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,050
We are grateful
to all of you, uncle.

202
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,860
We're taking your leave
for the last time.

203
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,900
After 13 years,
when the Pandavas return

204
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,030
we'll snatch
what's rightfully ours.

205
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,830
This court has introduced us
to the power of dishonesty.

206
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,930
We will make
this very court realise

207
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,830
the power of honesty.

208
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,900
Before I leave,
hear my oath, everyone.

209
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,800
I will tear open Dushashan's
chest and drink his blood!

210
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,760
The death of all the sons
of King Dhritarashtra

211
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,830
will be by my hands.

212
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,790
This the beginning of the end,
King Dhritarashtra.

213
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,860
In this court

214
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,990
everyone who witnessed
the deceit we were subjected to

215
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,800
along with Panchali's
humiliation

216
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,860
yet remained silent
will have to die.

217
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,890
Rivers will turn red with blood

218
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,860
there will be mountains
of severed heads

219
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,730
there will be a catastrophe!

220
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,920
There will be a great battle.

221
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,790
The greatest battle
in the history of mankind!
