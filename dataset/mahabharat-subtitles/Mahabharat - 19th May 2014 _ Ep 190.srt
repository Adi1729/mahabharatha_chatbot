1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,260
Engage in a grappling combat
with me, Krishna!

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,270
If I die in this combat

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,330
my guard will slay your parents.

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
If you die

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,130
your parents will be spared.

6
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,100
Now, tell me,
Krishna.

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,230
Do you still wish
to engage in a combat

8
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,260
or in order to save your parents

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,070
you are prepared
to embrace death.

10
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,030
I took an oath to save millions
of parents of the Aryan region.

11
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,120
That is why, I am here,
uncle Kansa.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,030
How many parents will you
be able to kill?

13
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,000
Engage in a combat with me, uncle!

14
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,800
All hail Shri Krishna!

15
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,840
All hail Shri Krishna!

16
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,870
All hail Shri Krishna!

17
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
All hail Shri Krishna!

18
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,900
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!

19
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,940
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!

20
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,030
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!

21
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,830
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!

22
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,870
All hail uncle Shri Krishna!

23
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,730
Uncle, did the possibility
of death of your parents

24
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,890
not rob you of your strength?

25
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,940
How could you gather
courage at that moment?

26
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,800
How were you able
to keep your mind calm?

27
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,840
Dear
where there is affection

28
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,940
there is always the possibility
of being agitated.

29
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,830
Being the reason of death

30
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,990
of the people who gave you life

31
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,770
is as agonizing

32
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,830
as being the reason
of death of your children.

33
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,830
But there is a truth

34
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,900
that man seldom remembers...

35
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,730
That every particle
of the creation

36
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,800
is a part of the Almighty.

37
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,870
That is why, they always
remain connected.

38
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,770
The way a flower

39
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,890
spreads fragrance
in the entire chamber

40
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,730
and an odoriferous object

41
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,830
spreads a foul smell in it

42
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,870
similarly

43
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,770
the joys and sorrows of man

44
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,960
influence the entire world.

45
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,900
One's joy

46
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
makes

47
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,670
everyone experience
a little joy.

48
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,830
One's sorrow makes

49
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,860
everyone experience
a little sorrow.

50
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,830
In other words, joy and sorrow
are alike in the world?

51
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,730
That is correct,
dear

52
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,700
Such is the creation
of the Almighty.

53
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,930
And when
unrighteousness escalates

54
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,840
this balance gets disrupted.

55
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,830
Because of Kansa,
the entire Yadava society

56
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,730
was filled with sorrow.

57
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,640
Because of Jarasandha,
the entire Aryan region

58
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,830
had to witness the destruction
of righteousness.

59
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,800
And now

60
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,800
because of Duryodhan

61
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,860
the entire Kuru kingdom
is unhappy.

62
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,830
The subjects are being
exploited and tortured.

63
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,690
When unhappiness
escalates in the world

64
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,640
very few people experience joy

65
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,570
while the majority
experience sorrow.

66
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,660
As a result, the society
falls prey to illness.

67
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,600
At a time like this,
treating that illness

68
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,560
becomes mandatory.

69
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,690
Sacrificing oneself

70
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
in order to put an end
to the unrighteous

71
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,570
becomes mandatory.

72
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,590
At a time like this,
relationships

73
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,690
and love hold no meaning.

74
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,830
Neither does selfishness
hold any value

75
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,760
nor does one hope for joy.

76
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,800
This is the situation
that lies ahead of you now.

77
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,570
The entire family of King Pandu

78
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,700
must either make a sacrifice

79
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,830
or accept the unrighteousness of
the sons of King Dhritarashtra.

80
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

81
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,630
The decision

82
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,590
rests with all of you.

83
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,670
A tree does not know
the taste of its fruit.

84
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,760
Similarly

85
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,530
none of you will derive

86
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,530
the benefit of this sacrifice.

87
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,670
Look within your hearts.

88
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,760
Do you have
the required compassion?

89
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Does your soul have
the required righteousness

90
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,670
to take the decision

91
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,570
to sacrifice yourself
for the welfare of the society?

92
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,730
All of you need to
meditate over this.

93
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,470
Give me your blessings,
uncle

94
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,530
to aid me pacify the burning
hearts of the sons of Pandu

95
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,400
so that they can pardon
Duryodhan and his brothers.

96
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,560
May the daughter of Drupad,
daughter-in-law Draupadi

97
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,500
give up the thought
of waging a war.

98
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,470
People who lead a righteous life

99
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,560
have the capacity within them
to pardon others, Vidur.

100
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,630
But I

101
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,400
have a suspicion on Shakuni.

102
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,430
What could have made him propose
the idea of avoiding a war?

103
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
How could he...

104
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,370
How could he make
Duryodhan and Dusshasan

105
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,370
accept this proposal?

106
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,400
He must certainly have
a plan behind all this.

107
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,400
It will certainly
get foiled, uncle.

108
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,590
Each plan of the King of Gandhar
will get foiled.

109
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Uncle,
the sons of Pandu

110
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,530
have Vasudev with them.

111
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,440
The competence to foil
even the most treacherous plan

112
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
lies with Vasudev Krishna,
uncle.

113
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,300
Allow me to leave.

114
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,370
Goodbye.

115
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,400
May your journey be fruitful.

116
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,420
Let's proceed,
charioteer.

117
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,210
Minister Vidur

118
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,240
is proceeding towards the city of Virat.

119
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,370
Splendid.

120
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,120
Marvellous,
my darling.

121
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,210
Before the war

122
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,340
the obstacle lying in
your path needs to be

123
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,240
taken care of by me.

124
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,120
His Excellency Bhishma

125
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,250
Great Guru Drona

126
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,310
Maharathi Jayadrath

127
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,180
and Great Archer Karna are

128
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,310
the great warriors on our side.

129
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,250
We must provide them
with the opportunity

130
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,310
to demonstrate their greatness.

131
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,210
That is why

132
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,070
I must look for a way

133
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,110
to tackle that treacherous
Vasudev Krishna

134
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,150
and that too,
quite soon.

135
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,310
What is the plan,
uncle?

136
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,210
My darling

137
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,120
as the envoy of peace

138
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
on behalf of the Pandavas

139
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,110
Krishna will certainly come here

140
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,220
because we have sent Sanjay
with the message

141
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,170
that

142
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,170
it is mandatory
for Vasudev Krishna

143
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,280
to be here.

144
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,200
My darling

145
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,270
you need to make

146
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,080
a strong and illusory rope

147
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,170
which cannot be

148
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,020
broken even by Airavat,*
*Airavata, a white elephant.

149

Lord Indra's mount.

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,080
The court of Hastinapur
shall witness

151
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
Just watch

152
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,210
how Vasudev Krishna

153
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,110
gets captured by us.

154
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,010
This tie

155
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,950
shall go beyond
the physical realm

156
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,170
and become a tie
between your souls.

157

son!

My blessing to you is

159
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,390
that may your wife
become your motivation

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,220
and not your limit.

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,330
May your husband
become your pride

163

and not your tie.

164

'is not a duty'

170
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,280
'but a decision'

171
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,320
'and a vow.'

172
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,290
'Similarly, for you,
this war'

173
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,350
'is not a duty.'

174
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
'It is a vow'

175
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,280
'taken for the society.'

176
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Give me your blessings,
Mother Draupadi.

177
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,320
May I be able to serve you
for the rest of my life.

178
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,160
'Apart from the five
husbands of yours'

179
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,110
'the entire lineage
of King Shantanu'

180
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,160
'will be destroyed.'

181
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,320
'The entire dynasty will be
annihilated in this war.'

182
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,160
'Look within your hearts.'

183
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,230
'Do you have
the required compassion'

184
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,230
'to take the decision'

185
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,160
'to sacrifice yourself
for the welfare of the society?'

186
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,320
My blessings...

187
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,120
I bless you to...

188
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,120
Bless him to have
a long life, dear.

189
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,190
The blessing to a long life

190
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,120
is the right of a person
during times of peace

191
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,220
but during war-time

192
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,020
it is merely a hope.
