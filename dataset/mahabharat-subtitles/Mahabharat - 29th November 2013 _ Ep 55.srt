1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,550
Princess, this feast
is for family only.

2
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,550
Apart from family
and the guests invited

3
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,550
no one else can be
a part of this. - Mother Kunti!

4
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,390
Mother Kunti!

5
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,520
Greetings! Just look at
who is here to meet you!

6
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,320
This is my friend Subhadra.

7
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,410
She used to practice with me
at the students' dwelling.

8
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,320
She is the daughter of Vasudeva.*
Kunti's brother, also father of Krishna (Vaasudeva, with long 'a').

9
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,380
Subhadra!

10
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,380
The daughter
of my brother Vasudeva?

11
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,320
When starting from Dwaraka,
brother Krishna told me

12
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,360
that Queen Kunti is our aunt.

13
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,350
He said that if I
served you whole-heartedly

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,510
fortune would smile upon me.

15
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,490
Greetings!

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Subhadra!

17
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,480
I hope, the health of
my younger brother Vasudeva

18
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,250
and that of the daughter
of Ugrasena, Devaki, is well.

19
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,410
And what about
the two brothers of yours?

20
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,290
Balaram and Krishna...

21
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,410
How are they?

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,220
All of them are doing well.

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
Hearing the heroic tales
of Krishna

24
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,360
always pleases my heart.

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,390
He is truly divine, Subhadra.

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,420
I would really like
to meet Krishna.

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,460
Brother Krishna says
that when the temperatures soar

28
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,190
the ocean is required to meet
the mountain at its crown.

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,380
If the circumstances
continue to be so

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,420
both of you shall meet soon.

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
What do you mean?

32
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,420
The meaning
of brother Krishna's words

33
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,450
cannot be comprehended
even by brother Balaram.

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,450
I merely listen to his words.

35
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,310
Subhadra, a few musicians
are present over there and

36
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,290
are playing some instruments.
Let's go listen to them.

37
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,250
Let's go.

38
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,120
Greetings, mother.

39
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,150
Greetings.

40
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,120
Bheem

41
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,120
your seat is over there.

42
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,320
Why are you seated
amongst the women here?

43
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,190
It has been years since
you have fed me, mother.

44
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,280
Today, you will have to feed me.

45
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,220
Everyone will laugh at you.

46
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
Greetings, mother.

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,350
Greetings.

48
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,320
You should feed him today.

49
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,090
The moment you feed him,
brother Bheem feels satiated.

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,150
Then all of us will be able
to have a hearty meal too.

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,320
Alright.

52
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,180
I shall go sit over there.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,250
I shall be here when
we are having our meals

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,080
so that you can feed me.

55
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,120
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir!

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,220
Greetings. - This is my friend
from the student's inn.

57
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,080
She is the sister of Krishna
Subhadra.

58
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,260
Greetings!
- May you be prosperous!

59
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,280
Krishna has transformed the
politics of the Aryan region.

60
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,080
Brother Krishna says

61
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,160
transformation in politics
of the Aryan region

62
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,210
will be brought by you.

63
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Dushala, I have heard that you

64
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,120
have completed your course
at the student's inn.

65
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Yes, brother Yudhishthir.

66
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I have learnt
all the arts necessary

67
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,150
but I could not learn
to play any musical instrument.

68
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,160
But Subhadra plays the veena* very well.
*String instrument from which sitar is derived.

69
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,990
Greetings.

70
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,110
Greetings.
- Greetings.

71
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,010
Brother Arjun can play
all musical instruments.

72
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,060
Nakul, this is no occasion
to play a musical instrument.

73
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,150
Do play the veena,
brother Arjun!

74
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,160
Even father is not here yet.

75
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,950
Go on.
Play it, Arjun.

76
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,990
Go on and play it, brother.

77
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,960
Even Princess Subhadra
is eager to hear you play it.

78
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Wonderful.

79
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,810
You played the veena
wonderfully, brother Arjun.

80
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,030
Go on and reward the other
musicians as well, Dusshasan.

81
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Friend Karna

82
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,250
do you play
a musical instrument too?

83
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,160
Me?

84
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,050
Had someone else asked me
this question, friend

85
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,060
I would have considered it
to be my insult.

86
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,130
To a true archer

87
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,960
the sound of his bow's string
is real music.

88
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,080
Very rightly said, friend.

89
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,910
The valour of the Kuru dynasty

90
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,080
is being tarnished by him.

91
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,950
Duryodhan!

92
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,930
Yesterday, Arjun had you pinned
to the ground with his arrows.

93
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,150
Did you forget about that?

94
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,090
Arjun had me pinned
with his arrows

95
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,020
but my friend Karna

96
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,930
had used just one arrow
to free me from my bond.

97
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,860
Did you forget about that,
brother Bheem?

98
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,860
Even a mouse can cleave
through a bond with its teeth.

99
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,930
This makes him useful

100
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,120
and not a warrior.

101
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,990
King of Anga Pradesh!

102
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,890
You may be a skilled archer

103
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,960
but when it comes to debating

104
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,930
you cannot beat
the sons of Pandu.

105
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,990
Some pluck a bow's string,
while some blow a gasket.

106
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,920
If he displays such a temper
on the battlefield

107
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,950
then his enemies

108
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,760
even before picking up
their weapons

109
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,050
will faint.

110
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,790
Go on and play, Prince.

111
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,920
To entertain the maidens

112
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,020
you would not only
play musical instruments

113
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,920
but also

114
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,990
be ready to become a dancer.

115
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,850
King of Anga Pradesh!

116
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,910
Arjun!

117
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,720
Restrain yourself!

118
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,530
What are you doing,
Prince Arjun?

119
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,690
Let me tell you,
Your Excellency.

120
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,720
Prince Arjun

121
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,520
is insulting a royal guest.

122
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,650
A king

123
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,650
who is an ally of
the kingdom of Hastinapur.

124
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,490
By drawing a weapon on him

125
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,690
he is jeopardizing
that alliance.

126
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,660
Now, maybe Prince Arjun

127
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,690
will draw a weapon on
the King of Gandhar as well.

128
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,620
Attention everyone!
King Dhritarashtra

129
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,460
is making his entrance!

130
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,560
Sanjay.

131
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,390
What is happening here?
- Your Majesty.

132
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,590
The very righteous,
the very knowledgeable

133
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,460
Chief Minister Vidur
is about to do justice here.

134
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,620
Justice?

135
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,490
Prince Arjun has drawn a weapon
on the King of Anga Pradesh.

136
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,560
Without the permission
of the king

137
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,560
he has jeopardized
an alliance of the kingdom

138
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,420
and this is the crime

139
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,490
of Prince Arjun.

140
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,580
Arjun must be just jesting.

141
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,460
But dear Gandhari

142
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,380
the King of Anga Pradesh, Karna

143
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,420
is neither a friend
of Prince Arjun

144
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,580
nor his brother.

145
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,560
To jest with the King
of Anga Pradesh, Karna

146
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,450
is a right he does not have.

147
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,460
This is

148
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,360
a very grave crime that you
have committed, Arjun.

149
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,520
But uncle...
- Be quiet!

150
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,290
Be quiet.

151
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,290
You decided to forge an enmity
with Anga Pradesh?

152
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,350
You have given Hastinapur
an invitation to a war!

153
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,450
I request the King of Anga
Pradesh to pardon Hastinapur.

154
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,290
Because of just one person

155
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,290
I cannot forget the benevolence
of the king, Your Majesty.

156
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,320
But Arjun ought to be
punished, father.

157
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,290
There is just one punishment
for this crime.

158
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,350
To be banished from
the entire kingdom of Kuru!
