1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,550
I command you,
grandfather

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,280
to follow Yudhishthir

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,590
and protect Hastinapur.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,490
As soon as you
get an opportunity

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,390
slay Yudhishthir.

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,300
Charioteer, proceed
towards Hastinapur.

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,130
Friend

8
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,500
it's time to take
the third step.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,470
It is time to extract
your brother Duryodhan

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,560
from Guru Drona's protection.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,070
Of course, Madhav.

12
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,370
Commander Dhrishtadyumna
is busy with that task.

13
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,220
Release the spheres of fire!

14
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,180
Attack the unit
releasing the spheres of fire!

15
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,210
Attack!

16
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Soldiers, get ready to attack.

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,430
Attack only once Guru Drona
reaches us.

18
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,300
Guru Drona has started attacking

19
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,270
Commander Dhrishtadyumna.

20
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,700
And Commander Dhrishtadyumna
will be able to stop

21
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,150
Guru Drona,
only for a short while.

22
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,790
Friend

23
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,690
we need to bring Guru Drona
towards you.

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,560
This is the fourth step
towards victory.

25
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,070
Guru Drona's only weakness
is his son.

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,140
Once I attack Ashwatthama

27
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,010
Guru Drona will come to me
voluntarily, Madhav.

28
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
And then

29
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,020
no one will be there
to protect Prince Duryodhan.

30
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,720
Neither His Excellency Bhishma
nor Guru Drona.

31
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,660
Nakul and Sahadev will clear
brother Bheem's path

32
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,800
to Prince Duryodhan.

33
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,350
The last stage of our victory
will be completed

34
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,510
when brother Bheem
kills Prince Duryodhan.

35
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,600
Kill?

36
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,000
Kill my Duryodhan!

37
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,440
No.

38
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
What kind of a plan is this,
Sanjay?

39
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,010
I... Anyhow, I need to send
this message to Duryodhan.

40
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,250
Yes!

41
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,480
We are very far away
from the battlefield

42
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,020
Your Highness.
- But...

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,690
But my son's life
is in danger, Sanjay.

44
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,390
I am feeling
very restless.

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,400
Do something, Sanjay.

46
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,730
Do something quickly.

47
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,500
The great sage Ved Vyas
blessed me with divine sight.

48
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,540
The pain born as a result
of that divine sight

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,580
will have to be borne by us,
Your Highness.

50
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,450
But how will I bear the pain
of my son's death?

51
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,150
Tell me what is happening
on the battlefield.

52
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,060
Who is there near him,
to protect him?

53
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,130
Tell me.

54
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,380
King Dhrupad

55
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,020
Guru Drona's son Ashwatthama
has always dreamt

56
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,960
of defeating me.

57
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,330
He should get an opportunity
to fulfil his wish.

58
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,040
I challenge you!

59
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,170
Select the weapon
of your choice, Ashwatthama.

60
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,960
Yudhishthir

61
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,190
you would be committing a sin

62
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,260
by attacking
the fort of Hastinapur.

63
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,530
And you must have
enough faith in me

64
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,470
to know that I never sin.

65
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,130
Then are you going
on a pilgrimage

66
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,630
by leaving Kurukshetra?

67
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,200
Catching a glimpse of you

68
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,610
is akin to going
on a pilgrimage, for me.

69
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,570
Today, this is my place
of pilgrimage, grandsire.

70
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,950
I was not going
to attack Hastinapur.

71
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,120
I am only proceeding
towards Hastinapur

72
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,420
as per Vasudev's strategy.

73
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,560
But I have received news
that you plan to attack.

74
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,730
You never lie.

75
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,140
When did I lie?

76
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,100
That I am proceeding
towards Hastinapur

77
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,170
to mount an attack...

78
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,610
This false news was circulated
by Vasudev.

79
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,010
I never said so, grandsire.

80
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,590
Vasudev must have been aware

81
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,190
that Duryodhan would get scared

82
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,230
and surely

83
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,500
command me to proceed
towards Hastinapur.

84
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,940
Yes, grandsire.

85
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,000
This is what is Vasudev's
strange strategy.

86
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,320
And now, you will have
to fight me and my army.

87
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,220
I will not be able to emerge
victorious against you

88
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,780
but I will surely fight you.

89
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,070
Guru Drona!

90
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,720
Your son Ashwatthama's life
is in danger.

91
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,420
He is battling Prince Arjun.

92
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,000
None of the students
of Guru Drona

93
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,270
are capable enough
to defeat him.

94
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,510
And as long as I am alive

95
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,640
my son's life
can never be in danger.

96
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,280
Guru Drona!

97
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,460
Friend...

98
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,190
the longer

99
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,140
you keep
Guru Drona occupied...

100
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,340
The longer brother Yudhishthir
keeps His Excellency Bhishma

101
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,140
away from the battlefield...

102
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,410
The better the chances
of brother Bheem

103
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,280
defeating Prince Duryodhan.

104
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,290
The final stage of our strategy

105
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,760
and our final step
towards victory

106
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,290
now depend on you,
brother Bheem

107
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,890
and brother Yudhishthir.

108
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,790
Just keep him occupied.

109
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,390
Get brother Bheem

110
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,730
as much time
as you can.

111
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,340
Duryodhan!

112
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,280
Have you become a coward

113
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,210
or have you lost
your self-confidence?

114
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,890
Come on! Fight me!

115
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,020
MY child!

116
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,360
My child

117
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,300
do not act foolishly.

118
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,430
Do not be a fool
by rising to his bait.

119
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,500
A smart warrior does not just
accept a challenge.

120
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,180
He does so at the right time.

121
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,770
Uncle

122
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,510
I shall crush this worm.

123
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,790
Possible, but not inevitable.

124
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,930
And his Excellency Bhishma

125
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,460
is absent from the battlefield
at this moment.

126
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,860
In this situation,

127
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,210
you should not
accept this challenge.

128
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,410
Soldiers, attack!

129
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,260
Soldiers, attack!

130
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,640
Duryodhan!

131
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,870
If you are really strong

132
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,550
face me on the battlefield.

133
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,480
Think about the prestige
of your clan.

134
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,250
You are shaming
all our ancestors

135
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,790
and our descendents.

136
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,800
Our ancestors in heaven

137
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,130
are hiding their faces in shame.

138
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,840
They are ridiculing
your parents!

139
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,330
Father

140
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,660
this is Vasudev's strategy.

141
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,360
I need to leave
at the earliest

142
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,440
to protect my friend
Duryodhan.

143
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,410
None of your strategies
will be successful, Arjun.

144
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,340
You cannot leave
without completing the fight.

145
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,680
What sort of a eunuch
has your mother

146
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,180
given birth to?
- Bheem!

147
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,520
Why did you declare war
when you fear death?

148
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,130
Come on, Duryodhan!

149
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,100
Rub your head on my feet.

150
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,700
Are you a Kshatriya
or a eunuch?

151
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,310
Bheem!
