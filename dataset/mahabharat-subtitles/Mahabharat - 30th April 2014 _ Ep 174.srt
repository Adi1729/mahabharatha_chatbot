1
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,320
I have always looked
forward to news about you.

2
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
But having never seen your face

3
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,280
left me restless.

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Father, I've been waiting
for you since birth.

5
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,800
Now, I will always stay with you
and serve you with all my heart.

6
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,960
Surely, my dear.

7
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
I am here to take you home.

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,120
How did you acquire
such terrific archery skills?

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,880
My mother always says that
a peacock is bound to lay

10
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,520
eggs that are either
white or yellow in colour.

11
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,880
But a peacock still bears
multi-coloured feathers.

12
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
I am your son.

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
I was born with your skills.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,440
My uncle reminds me all the
time that I should learn to kill

15
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,920
because killing my father's
enemies is my path to salvation.

16
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,320
My mother reminds me all the
time that I should learn to die.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,160
Dying while avenging my aunt's
libel is my path to salvation.

18
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,920
I knew that your uncle
was a man of intellect.

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,120
And that your mother
is such a fool!

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Why would you die, my son?

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,920
You were born to be immortal.

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,520
Where is your mother?
And where is your uncle?

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
Mother is in her chamber

24
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,280
while uncle is at
the edifice of combat arts.

25
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Uncle Duryodhana
is paying him a visit.

26
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,480
What work

27
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
brings Prince Duryodhana here?

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
Forgive me, master.

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,600
Forgive me.

30
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,160
My mind roves.

31
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,680
I see enemies

32
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,080
wherever I look.

33
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,840
Master, all I ever see
are enemies.

34
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,120
There is no joy left

35
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,320
in my life.

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,520
Put an end to my misery, master.
Kill me!

37
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,040
Prince Duryodhana.

38
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,640
Whimpering doesn't befit you.

39
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,920
Master

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,240
I will be honest
with you.

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,720
What frightens me more
than the dark of the night

42
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,760
is the darker period of eclipse.

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
My honour, my dreams

44
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,600
and my life
have been eclipsed, master.

45
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,240
I feel more pain
than death can cause.

46
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,760
Just like rotten luck itself

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
the Pandavas

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,560
have devoured
all my happiness, master.

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
Every last bit of it.

50
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,320
What have the Pandavas done?

51
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
They have been sentenced
to an exile

52
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,600
while you have spent your life

53
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,480
in the comfort of a palace.

54
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,600
You talk of exile, master?

55
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,160
Am I at fault for their exile?

56
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,680
If they hadn't
participated in gambling

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,720
they wouldn't have lost.

58
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
But, master

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
I was born to face injustice.

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,560
Why am I not the rightful
heir to my father's empire?

61
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
Why?

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,760
Why can't my father hand
over his throne to me?

63
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,440
Why?

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,360
How can Aryavart* be so unjust to me?
*"Abode of the Vedic India Aryans", the name for North India in classical Sanskrit literature.

65
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,560
The Pandavas insisted
on my kingdom's division.

66
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
The woman I was supposed
to get married to...

67
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,080
They abducted her.

68
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Try to recall, master

69
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,560
that I had to return from Dwarka

70
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,080
unwed to that woman.

71
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,120
The whole of Aryavart
mocked me, master.

72
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,760
Master.

73
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,160
I am not blaming you.

74
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,680
Instead I am bringing to light

75
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,400
how the Pandavas have meted
out insults to me all my life.

76
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
That's all I wish to disclose.

77
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,880
Now the Pandavas

78
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,440
are turning the entire
Aryavart against me.

79
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,920
So that they may wage
war against me.

80
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
How am I at fault?

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,760
How have I wronged them, master?

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
Duryodhana, you disrobed
a woman amidst a gathering.

83
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,240
Does that not qualify
as a wrongful act?

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,560
If a slave insults her master
amidst a gathering

85
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,680
punishing her for this act does

86
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,000
not qualify as a wrongful act.
Does it, Vasudev?

87
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
But in case

88
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,080
the punishment seems
excessively cruel

89
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,320
I apologise.

90
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,160
I am willing to expiate
for the same.

91
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,800
I will do that, master

92
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
but please put an end
to this injustice.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,240
Master.

94
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,800
If a war does take place

95
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
it calls for a quid pro quo
action from my end as well.

96
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,360
The Kuru dynasty's entire
wealth will be obliterated.

97
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
Master.

98
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
Only you

99
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,800
can prevent this war
from taking place.

100
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I? What can I do in this matter,
Prince Duryodhana?

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,640
Your support is what
fuels the Pandavas, master.

102
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,320
If you withdraw your support

103
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,280
the Pandavas cannot even
contemplate going to war.

104
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,680
They cannot.

105
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,680
What is it that you
really wish, Duryodhana?

106
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,200
What do want us to do?

107
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Vasudev.

108
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,920
Vasudev, we aren't worthy

109
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,720
of advising yourself

110
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,400
and the all-conquering Balram.

111
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,640
We can only request

112
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,040
that both of you

113
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,640
refrain from

114
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,360
taking sides.

115
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
You should not worry
about that, Shakuni.

116
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,960
Such a thing
will never transpire.

117
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,880
Prince Duryodhana
is absolutely right.

118
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,280
The outcome of a game
of gambling cannot act

119
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
as a reason for war.

120
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,600
Therefore, I promise you today

121
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,760
that I

122
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,920
Krishna or any other
soldier of the Yadav army

123
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
will not pick up a weapon
in support of the Pandavas.

124
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,920
You... Your words are bliss,
all conquering Balram.

125
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,360
that I,

126
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,600
Krishna or any other
soldier of the Yadav army

127
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,480
will not pick up a weapon
in support of the Pandavas.

128
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,360
Elder brother.

129
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
What kind of a decision is that?

130
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,320
How can you consider us at fault

131
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
without even listening
to our side of the story?

132
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,080
Prince Arjun.

133
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
I'm not finding fault
with anyone here.

134
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,320
I am only trying to understand
what the situation demands.

135
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,800
From what I can understand

136
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,400
two groups decided to engage
in a game of gambling.

137
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,880
Both sides agreed to all
the rules of the game.

138
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,800
And your group ended
up on the losing side.

139
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,280
Upon being defeated

140
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,600
you cannot start a great war
as a means of having revenge.

141
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,120
We were cheated,
brother Balaram.

142
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,320
Then you should have
quit the game.

143
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,520
But we were bound
by our promise.

144
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,600
Only when you know
the entire situation

145
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,560
will everything be clear to you.

146
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,280
Prince Arjun!

147
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,480
No truth about this situation
is hidden from me.

148
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,200
Despite your absence,
people have talked about

149
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
that game of dice
all these years.

150
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,200
That is why,
I need no information

151
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,760
from either you or anyone else,
Prince Arjun.

152
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,480
Maybe you feel that I have been

153
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,080
influenced by the weeping
of Crown Prince Duryodhan

154
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,360
but it is not so.

155
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,560
Since the beginning, I have
believed in only one truth

156
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,560
and it is

157
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,640
that in the game of dice

158
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Crown Prince Duryodhan
did not act as unrighteously

159
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,320
as Prince Yudhishthir.

160
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,680
He had bet his wife in the game.

161
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,840
He had bet his brothers
in the game!

162
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,800
That is the most
unrighteous act.

163
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Despite all this,
Prince Yudhishthir

164
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
did not quit the game.

165
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
He had the opportunity to do so.

166
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,920
When he was asked if he
was proud of his decision

167
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
to bet his brothers

168
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,960
he could have quit the game

169
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,640
but Prince Yudhishthir
did not do so

170
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,360
because his righteous ways
had made him arrogant.

171
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,760
When one's righteous ways
make a person arrogant

172
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,320
Prince Arjun

173
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,920
one acts solely
in an unrighteous manner.

174
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
In an unrighteous manner.

175
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,000
That is why, the promise I made
to Crown Prince Duryodhan

176
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,560
seems correct to me.

177
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Madhav

178
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,400
please persuade brother Balaram

179
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,800
to change his mind
and take our side.

180
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,920
How can I persuade him,
friend?

181
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
He is correct.

182
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Arrogance

183
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,760
always makes one commit
the gravest of acts.

184
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
It is true

185
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,640
that now,
even I

186
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,040
am bound by
my brother's decision, friend.

187
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,560
On behalf

188
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,040
of the Pandavas

189
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,040
we cannot fight any longer.

190
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,040
He won!
- He has won!

191
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,720
He won!
- He has won!

192
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,560
He won!
- Charioteer, stop the chariot.

193
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,280
He won...
- He lost!

194
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
He lost!
- He has lost!

195
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,040
He lost!
- He has lost!

196
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
He lost!
- He has lost!

197
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
He lost!
- He has lost!

198
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,560
He lost!
- He has lost!

199
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
He lost!
- Enough!

200
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
What is all this?!

201
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,440
Mighty Balaram!

202
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,000
Just look
at all this!

203
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
Stop them!

204
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
Bhamri, only I have
the sole right to you now!

205
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,480
No!

206
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,640
I will not leave
my husband and family

207
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,560
and go to someone else!

208
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,560
This is what we had decided!

209
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,080
If I knocked him over

210
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,800
then his wife
would belong to me!

211
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
Move away!

212
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,120
What is this foolishness?!

213
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
By betting a woman

214
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
you are tarnishing
the name of wrestling!

215
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,200
End this game
right away!

216
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,800
What loathsome
behaviour is this?!

217
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,520
If one does not bet
something in a game

218
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
then the game is no fun.

219
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
You cannot stop us,
Mighty Balaram.

220
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Here, you are given the same
respect we give to the King

221
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
but you are not the King.

222
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,040
In Dwaraka,
the subjects are the King!

223
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
What on earth are you
rambling on about?!

224
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,720
Who are you to stop us?

225
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
We will do what we want.

226
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,840
This woman was bet in the game!

227
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,520
Now, she belongs
only to the winner.

228
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
First,
you insulted a woman

229
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,160
and now,
you are challenging me!

230
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,480
Do you know
its consequences, fool?!

231
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
If you have such strength

232
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,360
then go and ask
the Kauravas and the Pandavas

233
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,160
the same question.

234
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,040
Let him go,
brother.

235
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,720
We shall discuss this with the
subjects and Ministers later.

236
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,360
This is not
the appropriate time.

237
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,440
These maidens will be

238
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,200
safe with Queen Satyabhama
and Queen Rukmini.

239
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
If anyone tries to lay

240
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,240
even a finger on them

241
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
then I shall punish him myself.

242
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,160
There will be no war!
How is that possible?

243
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,680
What kind of a decision
has uncle taken?

244
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,600
When it is a question
of Mother Draupadi's honour

245
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,640
righteousness-unrighteousness
do not come into the picture!

246
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,760
I shall go and ask uncle
about this right away.

247
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,840
Abhimanyu!

248
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,120
Your father has
not taken this decision

249
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,520
and neither has brother Krishna.

250
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
My Lord

251
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,920
nothing that brother says
has one meaning.

252
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
Did you forget?

253
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,560
Did you forget that his other name is Ranchhod*?
*Ranchhodrai, one refused to fight the war and fled to Dwarka for the sake of peace.

254
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,680
Sometimes, in order
to defeat the enemy

255
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,040
brother exits
from the battlefield.

256
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,920
He need not take to arms
to emerge victorious.
