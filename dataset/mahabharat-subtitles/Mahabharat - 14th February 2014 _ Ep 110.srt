1
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,640
What happened, uncle?

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,880
Why did you stop that chariot?

3
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,900
Where are you going?

4
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,880
Gandhar awaits me, my darling.

5
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,840
Now, I have nothing
left to do in Hastinapur.

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,650
What are you saying, uncle?

7
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,740
You would leave for Gandhar
only after getting me anointed...

8
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,640
You had taken such an oath.

9
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,840
Anointed...

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,840
You cannot get anointed,
my darling.

11
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,710
All my life

12
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,580
I have tried to make you King

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,610
but now, I have

14
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,650
been defeated, my darling.

15
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,610
How did you get defeated, uncle?

16
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,720
Seeing that the Pandavas
are alive?

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,750
But I am still the Crown Prince.

18
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,640
I do not fear the sons of Pandu.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,620
If they have
the strength of Panchal

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,780
then I have
the army of Hastinapur.

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,540
Do not make such a mistake,
my darling.

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,620
Deeming Bali, the King
of the 'Vanaras,' dead

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,780
Sugriv had become the King.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,550
When Bali returned
safe and sound

25
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,650
not only did Sugriv
have to leave the city

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,570
but also the kingdom
of Kishkindha.

27
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,650
Upon learning that the previous
Crown Prince is alive

28
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,680
no one will deem you
the Crown Prince.

29
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Our competence is not dead yet,
King of Gandhar.

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,580
I will use my competence
to make friend Duryodhan King.

31
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,520
My beloved Duryodhan
a river nourishes the fields

32
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,520
but when it floods them

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,610
it covers the entire land
with sand.

34
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Then nothing grows on it.

35
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,570
The land becomes barren.

36
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,710
Similar is the case
with friendship.

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,610
But uncle, my friend Karna...

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,680
I do not doubt him, beloved!

39
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,640
He has great valour and
incomparable competence.

40
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,480
He is completely
dedicated to you but

41
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,550
when it comes to
righteousness and friendship

42
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,520
deciding between the two
is exceedingly difficult

43
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,710
for the King of Anga.

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Today, had he

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,570
killed Bheem and Arjun

46
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,640
had righteousness and generosity
not stemmed within him

47
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,640
you could have had
the kingdom with great ease.

48
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,570
Had I killed Bheem and Arjun
today, King of Gandhar

49
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,670
the entire Aryan region
would have known

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,410
about the identity
of the deceased.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,450
And it would have also known

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,440
about the people who are alive.

53
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,510
And then the great Bhishma

54
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,550
would certainly have brought
Yudhishthir to Hastinapur.

55
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,450
Such deep thinking!

56
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,350
After such deep thinking

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,610
did you decide upon not fighting
King Karna of Anga?!

58
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,610
No, King of Gandhar.

59
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,580
I had thought only of my duty.

60
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
It is the duty
of a competent warrior

61
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,440
to either strive for his victory

62
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,470
or

63
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,420
praise that of another.

64
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,510
And when a person takes a
decision based on righteousness

65
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,520
the decision is always correct.

66
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,350
And did you not think,
King of Anga

67
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,580
that when Yudhishthir
will return to Hastinapur

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,570
he will be protected

69
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,420
by great warriors
like Bheem and Arjun?

70
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,420
And behind them will be

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,520
the entire army of Drupad!

72
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,470
Do remember one thing,
my darling.

73
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,510
When Yudhishthir
will return to Hastinapur

74
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,510
that old man

75
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,320
will never let you become King.

76
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Uncle

77
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,250
why do you not
suggest something?

78
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,340
There is a way out, my darling.

79
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,510
But this time,
you must listen to me.

80
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,510
And so must your friend.

81
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,470
Do I have your word?

82
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,440
You have my word, uncle.

83
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,280
Then listen...

84
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,380
The Pandavas are alive

85
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,410
but before this news spreads

86
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,280
to the people of Hastinapur

87
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,320
You must get yourself anointed
as the Crown Prince.

88
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,270
But

89
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,370
your father's heart

90
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,450
keeps turning towards
righteousness.

91
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
That is why

92
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,210
until you get anointed

93
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,180
you must keep it
a secret from him

94
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,150
that the five of them are alive.

95
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,380
Yudhishthir has
not yet been anointed.

96
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,250
If you get anointed

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,180
then

98
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,250
Yudhishthir's right
will get annihilated.

99
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,410
And the marriage to
the Princess of Panchal

100
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,340
will not benefit him
either, my darling!

101
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,240
Stop, priest.

102
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Before the marriage
ceremony begins

103
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,010
I wish to have some answers,
Great Sage Vyas.

104
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,940
Right before my eyes,
my daughter

105
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,950
is about to enter a life

106
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,020
which will be more painful
than a funeral pyre.

107
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,180
You have deemed it righteous

108
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,210
but will the world?

109
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,730
You have deemed it righteous
but will the world?

110
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,870
Will she get happiness from
this terrible sacrifice of hers?

111
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,610
You are correct, King Drupad.

112
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,740
Princes

113
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,810
marriage is based upon

114
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,700
seven vows, which are taken
by the bride and the groom.

115
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,900
But this is
an atypical marriage.

116
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,610
In order to make it
fruitful and righteous

117
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
you must take
some additional vows.

118
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,840
The way a plant cannot be sown
in two different places at once

119
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,630
and a Minister cannot
serve two Kings

120
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,580
similarly, at a time, dedication

121
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,610
can only be towards one person,
sons of Pandu.

122
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,670
So, how can a woman
fulfill her duties

123
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,600
towards five husbands
at the same time?

124
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,640
A single person cannot dedicate
oneself to five people, My Lord.

125
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,640
But five people can certainly
be dedicated to a single person.

126
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,740
We five brothers dedicate
ourselves to Princess Draupadi

127
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,770
now and forever.

128
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,770
We shall accept
all her decisions.

129
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,540
Splendid, Yudhishthir.

130
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,540
For an entire year, Draupadi

131
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,570
will be wife to only one of you.

132
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,760
During that period

133
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,510
only that person can enter
Draupadi's chamber

134
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,770
to whom she gives
the right to do so.

135
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,610
For the sake
of Draupadi's happiness

136
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,540
I am asking
for this difficult vow.

137
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,500
But isn't the basis
of a relationship

138
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,730
not remembrance, My Lord?

139
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,740
Then after a year,
how will my sister

140
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,730
free herself from
the joys and sorrows?

141
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,540
She will get crushed
under those memories, My Lord.

142
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,630
Every year, I shall perform

143
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,740
an austere meditation
before the holy fire.

144
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,710
By forgetting the relationships

145
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,740
and memories of the past

146
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,580
I shall purify my soul.

147
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,640
My Lord

148
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,540
not only Princess Draupadi

149
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,530
but also we five brothers
shall perform such a meditation

150
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,400
every year.

151
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,660
We take such an oath.

152
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,510
I have another question,
My Lord.

153
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,400
For various reasons,
Princes have to

154
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,410
marry multiple times.

155
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,640
If the Pandavas
bring their other wives

156
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,480
then what will become
of my daughter?

157
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,510
People do not
fulfill their duties

158
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,600
towards somebody over which
everyone has the right.

159
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,600
This question relates
only to me, My Lord.

160
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,470
Only I have been married.

161
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,500
I give my word

162
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,400
that I shall never bring
my first wife

163
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,440
within the perimeters
of the city.

164
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,570
Irrespective of where we live,
there will be only one Queen

165
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,430

Princess Draupadi.

166
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
We take an oath that
we shall fulfill our vows

167
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,130

May the Almighty fill our lives
with righteousness.

172
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,230
'This is an oath
for my honour.'

173

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,030
'on the verge of success.'

175
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,960
'The more difficult
the struggle'

176
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,260
'the stronger the basis.'

177
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,160
'This is my'

'and this is why
I have been born.'

183
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,120
'The evening sky is
a shade of vermillion.'

184
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,060
'This is a grave moral dilemma'

185
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,030
'in the history'

186
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,160
'of genesis.'
