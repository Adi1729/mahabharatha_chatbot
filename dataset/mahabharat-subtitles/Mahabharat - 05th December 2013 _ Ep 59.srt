1
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,330
Allow me to leave.

2
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,320
Teacher!

3
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,300
Every word uttered by my teacher

4
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,260
is an order to me!

5
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,030
I take the oath

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,130
that you will have
either Drupad at your feet

7
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,000
or my severed head

8
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,290
in your hands!

9
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
Arjun

10
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,070
your vow shall
indeed be fulfilled

11
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,100
but at my hands.

12
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,140
Father, His Highness

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,970
give the order
to launch an attack.

14
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,030
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,030
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!

16
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,200
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!

17
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,070
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!

18
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,130
Give the order to launch
an attack, Your Majesty!

19
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,160
'Drupad.'

20
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,040
'The Region of Arya.'

21
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,900
'North, North-East,
East, South-East'

22
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,900
'South, South-West,
West, North-West.'

23
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,910
'Vidarbh, Kunti, Hastinapur.'

24
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,910
'Ganges,
Panchal - City of Kampilya.'

25
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,930
Where is King Drupad?

26
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,030
Land is life.

27
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,900
From land originates life.

28
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,070
Land is life.

29
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,030
From land originates life.

30
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,130
Land is life.

31
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,000
From land originates life.

32
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,040
What news do you bring,
messenger?

33
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,970
All hail King Drupad.

34
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Your Majesty, Dronacharya
has sent the message

35
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,790
that he is getting ready
to attack Panchal very soon.

36
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,940
He had attempted to usurp
only nine miles of my land!

37
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,000
And with these hands of mine

38
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,000
I buried him in the land here!

39
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,900
A person who eyes
the land of Panchal

40
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,770
does not have the right
to reside here.

41
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,890
Messenger

42
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,890
go and send Drona the message

43
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,900
that a stone which is
cast at the ocean

44
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,900
lands directly
in the Netherworld!

45
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,830
Cover his body with soil.

46
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Prince Dusshasan.

47
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,890
Yes.
- Pay attention, friend.

48
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,830
While sharpening the swords,
make sure the soldiers

49
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,700
do not file them too much else
the shaft will lose its weight.

50
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,830
Certainly, King of Anga.

51
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Prince Vikarna.

52
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,790
Make sure the shafts
of the swords and arrows

53
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,870
are as small as possible.
- Alright.

54
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,800
Otherwise they won't travel far.
- Certainly, King of Anga.

55
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,830
Carry them away properly.

56
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,930
I do not require
such a heavy armour.

57
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,770
Go and give it to the Pandavas.

58
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,800
The armour of
my friend Duryodhan

59
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,770
is me.
- In other words, I have

60
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,870
the best armour in the world

61
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,760
friend Karna.
- Undoubtedly, friend.

62
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,860
By agreeing to take part
in this war

63
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,760
you have magnified
my self-confidence, friend.

64
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,930
I was waiting for you.

65
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,900
We must go to my uncle now

66
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,830
to chalk out the strategies
for the war.

67
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,830
Let's proceed.
- Alright.

68
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,730
What is he doing?

69
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Bheem!

70
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,790
What are you doing?

71
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,630
Oh!
Brother Duryodhan!

72
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,630
Do you wish to have your idol

73
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,670
built on the shoulders of mine?

74
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,700
So, I thought of coming here

75
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,600
and seeing how much it weighs.

76
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,800
If it is not too heavy,
I can hold it in my hands.

77
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,860
May I have a look?

78
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,790
It broke.

79
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,630
I am certain that while
making the idol, the sculptor

80
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,600
must have used arrogance
and not self-confidence.

81
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
They might look similar
but are vastly different.

82
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,730
Now, pray to the Almighty,
beloved brother Duryodhan

83
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,660
that may your capability
be stronger than your idol.

84
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Do remember.

85
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,690
Drupad will

86
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,570
not go this easy on you.

87
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,420
Careful!

88
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,390
Do not step on
those illusory circles

89
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,120
else you will land
in the Netherworld.

90
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,290
From there.

91
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,180
Hey!
Not there!

92
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,310
There.

93
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,120
Now, to your left.

94
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,160
No!

95
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,160
Careful!
Careful.

96
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,210
Now, come from that way.

97
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,230
And now, from there.
This way.

98
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,280
What were you doing?

99
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,290
Teaching you how to dance.

100
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,190
You dance quite well.

101
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,120
In other words,
these are not illusory circles?

102
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,150
No.

103
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,190
I was devising formations
for the war.

104
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,060
I was meditating
on how to create them

105
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,220
and how to navigate
through them.

106
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,290
What is this?

107
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Discus formation.

108
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,280
Could you explain it to me?

109
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,160
It is not your cup of tea.

110
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,220
It will bore you.

111
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,280
My brother Krishna says,
only a person who is afraid

112
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,120
devises an Illusory Labyrinth

113
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,020
but only an able person
can navigate through it.

114
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,020
Does your brother Krishna deem
himself highly knowledgeable?

115
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,250
No. Other people deem him
highly knowledgeable.

116
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,220
What brings you here?

117
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,250
I wanted to ask you the name

118
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,250
of the melody you had played

119
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,250
the other day.

120
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,120
Why?
- It was beautiful.

121
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,220
It is still resonating
in my ears.

122
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,220
It was a very soothing melody

123
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,180
at least, to me.

124
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,250
It was more like war music
than a soothing melody.

125
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,160
Uh!

126
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,090
It is not always necessary
for a melody to be soothing.

127
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,030
Sometimes, the psyche
of a person deems it so.

128
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,190
Were you thinking of a lad
you are in love with?

129
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,960
Is that all?

130
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,180
Do you not wish to learn
war music for your love?

131
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,990
Brother Krishna has
sent this for you.

132
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,990
What is it?

133
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,920
I do not know.

134
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,150
Brother Krishna said,
if you keep this with you

135
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
it will be of use to you.

136
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,930
Listen.
- Yes.

137
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,960
Are you going to be
at the front of the army?

138
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
Certainly.

139
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,990
I shall be at the front.

140
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,950
At the very front.

141
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,030
I shall indeed be at the front.

142
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
Sons

143
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,420
while filling a bowl
with a liquid

144
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,290
ensure that it is
properly filled

145
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,450
and that nothing spills over.

146
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,360
Mother, we shall ensure that our
valour pleases Dronacharya.

147
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,380
Have faith.

148
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,320
Our strength

149
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,330
will not be used to torture the
Panchal army or King Drupad.

150
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,220
May you be victorious!

151
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,450
Goodbye, mother.

152
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,260
May you be victorious!

153
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,450
Goodbye, father.

154
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,310
My son

155
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,360
I could not keep the promise

156
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,160
I made to you.

157
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,230
This is what
I was afraid of, father.

158
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,360
You fail to grasp the tricks
of grandfather and the Minister

159
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,280
because you are
a righteous man.

160
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,290
Uncle often says

161
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,420
that a righteous person

162
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,160
can be treated
quite unrighteously.

163
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,250
I have something more to say.

164
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,190
Your grandfather Bhishma

165
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,380
is reminded of righteousness
only when

166
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,250
he has to resort to
something unrighteous.

167
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,390
Hence, even when poisoning

168
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,350
the life of a maiden,
there was no

169
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,120
feeling of remorse within him.

170
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,260
What are you saying, brother?

171
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,250
Have you heard about
the King of Kashi

172
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,190
and the woeful tale of his
daughter Amba, beloved sister?

173
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,280
I have heard

174
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,250
that the elder sister
of your mothers, Amba

175
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,290
has been born again
to slay the great Bhishma.

176
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,380
Impossible!

177
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,190
It is impossible to slay uncle!

178
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,230
He has the boon
of dying at will.

179
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,180
And a person who cannot die

180
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,220
cannot be defeated.

181
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,190
These are mere rumours!

182
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,220
He has spread these rumours
only to scare people.

183
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,360
But you need not be afraid of
grandfather any longer, father.

184
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,180
The strength of
the 100 sons of yours

185
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,120
is enough to defeat anyone.

186
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,060
We are certain, son,
that by proving your might

187
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,180
you will make
your parents proud.

188
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,190
But do remember, son

189
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,130
that more than your victory

190
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,130
your life is
more precious to me.

191
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,290
Have faith, father.

192
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,230
Drupad does not have the might

193
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,190
to defeat your son.

194
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,150
I shall certainly make him bow

195
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,080
before our teacher.

196
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,060
Why do you not behead him and
place it at your teacher's feet?

197
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,290
Dronacharya will be
held guilty for this

198
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,120
while you shall earn
all the virtues.

199
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,120
Chopping the thorns off a tree

200
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,990
is a wise thing to do,
Duryodhan.

201
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,150
Goodbye.
- May you be victorious!

202
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,060
May you be victorious!
