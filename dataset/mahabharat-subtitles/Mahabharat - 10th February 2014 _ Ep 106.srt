1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,040
Whatever Arjun has got

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,240
must be shared equally
among you five brothers.

3
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,230
What happened, son?

4
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,970
What did you say, mother?

5
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,100
I got the daughter of Drupad,
the King of Panchal, as charity.

6
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,040
I got a wife, mother.

7
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,010
Your daughter-in-law.

8
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,070
And

9
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
unknowingly, you

10
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,900
ordered us five brothers

11
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,010
to divide her amongst ourselves.

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,940
How can

13
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,940
a woman be divided
into five parts, mother?

14
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,030
How?

15
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,890
Draupadi.

16
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,900
Draupadi!
Stop, dear!

17
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,870
But Arjun, why...

18
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,990
Why did you

19
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,030
use the term 'charity'
for a woman?

20
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,000
It is charity, mother.

21
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,060
Giving away one's daughter...

22
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,100
You have taught us

23
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,060
that all forms of charity
in the world

24
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,040
tie down the fortune
of the one engaging in it.

25
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,040
Only giving away one's daughter

26
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,930
opens up one's fortune.

27
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,930
That is why, Nakul had said

28
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,030
that his brother Arjun's
fortune had opened up.

29
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,970
Mother, you could have
at least turned around once.

30
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,900
The ones who have
the right to give orders

31
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,900
do not have the right
to be ignorant.

32
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,890
'Mother, have a look'

33
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,730
'at what I have got as charity.'

34
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,030
'Whatever Arjun has got'

35
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,910
'must be shared equally
among you five brothers.'

36
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,030
'I got the daughter of Drupad,
King of Panchal, as charity.'

37
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,960
'How can'

38
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,960
'a woman be divided
into five parts, mother?'

39
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,800
Draupadi...

40
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,890
Dear

41
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,960
pardon me.

42
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,830
It was my mistake.

43
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,730
But

44
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,900
my sons never planned
to go to your 'swayamvar.'

45
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,770
Never had I imagined
that Arjun...

46
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,870
That Arjun would win
the competition.

47
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,870
Were you that certain
of your plans, Lady Kunti?

48
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,740
Are your sons that competent
that they can circumvent

49
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,900
both fate and destiny
and realize all your plans?

50
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,810
You are correct, Draupadi.

51
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,930
It is my fault.

52
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,660
You have every right
to be angry with me.

53
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,640
I am your offender.

54
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,790
No, lady-

55
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,800
Pardon me.

56
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,600
Blaming you is incorrect.

57
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,840
If the floodwaters of a river

58
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,600
drown a deer

59
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,600
then the river is not at fault.

60
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,600
But even the deer
is not at fault, lady.

61
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,670
What is my fault
in this situation?

62
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,570
You are not at fault.

63
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,570
You are not at fault, dear.

64
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,630
I can understand

65
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,640
your state of mind.

66
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,700
The mere thought

67
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,560
of being divided among men makes
a woman experience hell itself.

68
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,740
But
that will not happen.

69
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,830
The ones who have
the right to give orders

70
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,670
also have the right
to abrogate them.

71
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,570
I...

72
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
I will tell my sons

73
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,800
not to follow my orders.

74
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,560
'This life, this world'

75
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,740
'are games of time and tide.'

76
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:58,580
'What is bound to happen,
happens'

77
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,640
'and by its rules
we must abide.'

78
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,440
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

79
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,700
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

80
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,670
'Joy and sorrow
are parts of life'

81
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,600
'Only that happens
what is destined.'

82
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,630
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

83
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,440
'Time is the strongest
in the world.'

84
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,530
Arjun.

85
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,510
Marry Draupadi
this instant, son.

86
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,330
Marry Draupadi
this instant, son.

87
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
And right after that

88
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,590
you must go to Kampilya.

89
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,500
Forget the order

90
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,590
I gave you by deeming it
a bad dream, son.

91
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,420
No, mother.

92
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,550
That is not possible now.

93
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,390
Arjun

94
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,450
listen to mother.

95
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,320
When a volcano erupts

96
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,290
birds do not stay on
the trees of the mountain.

97
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,290
They fly away instantly.

98
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,390
If a place involves
a moral dilemma

99
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,490
one must not
stay there for long.

100
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,490
You should go.

101
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,260
After a while

102
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,490
we shall drop mother off
near the kingdom of Panchal.

103
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,290
Drop me off?

104
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,350
What do you mean?

105
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,300
Mother, you may be present
in Arjun's marriage

106
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,290
but we four brothers cannot.

107
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,450
We will never show ourselves
to Princess Draupadi again.

108
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,360
What are you saying, son?

109
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,360
Why will you not be able
to show yourselves?

110
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,200
When I have abrogated my order

111
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,350
then what problem
do you have with it?

112
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,360
Mother, an order
can be abrogated

113
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,420
but not the words
uttered by one.

114
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,350
Words are like seeds

115
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,260
and when they
sink into the heart

116
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,300
they emerge in some form
or the other in the future.

117
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,320
That is why, mother,
wise men say

118
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,330
that the one who utters words
without thinking first

119
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,280
commits a sin.

120
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,380
But son

121
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,390
it was...

122
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,300
It was a mistake.

123
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,220
Shravan being shot
was also a mistake, mother.

124
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,350
But for that

125
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,250
King Dashrath had to
pay very dearly.

126
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,130
It is not that things
done unintentionally

127
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,250
have no consequences, mother.

128
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,130
Unknowingly, you have bound

129
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,390
Princess Draupadi by
your words mother.

130
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,290
You have bound her by your words

131
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,160
and she is obligated
to fulfill them.

132
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,320
Unknowingly, you have

133
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,320
named the relationship between
Princess Draupadi and us.

134
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,160
And the moral dilemma
is that, mother

135
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,320
it cannot be rendered false.

136
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,100
Then what is the solution to it?

137
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Answer me.

138
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,120
Answer me.

139
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,090
Someone please answer me!

140
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,090
What is the solution to it?

141
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Yudhishthir

142
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,290
tell me.

143
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,090
Answer me.

144
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,060
Someone please answer me!

145
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,190
No maiden can be divided
among five men, mother.

146
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,100
The solution to a moral dilemma
always lies in meditation.

147
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,030
All of us have decided that
we will meditate, mother.

148
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,100
It is Arjun's duty
to marry the Princess.

149
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,990
He shall marry her

150
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,990
and we four brothers
shall resort to asceticism.

151
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,550
Princess.

152
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,740
Prince Arjun

153
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,520
is there a solution
to Lady Kunti's order?

154
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,680
It is easy to look for gravel
amidst wheat, Princess.

155
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
But when

156
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,610
wheat falls amidst gravel

157
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,720
it is impossible to look for it.

158
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,610
Similarly

159
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,480
finding solutions
to certain situations

160
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,420
is very difficult.

161
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,450
How did this situation
become so difficult, Prince?

162
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,620
My father conducted
the 'swayamvar'

163
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,720
you won the competition

164
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
based solely on your competence,
I deemed you my husband.

165
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,420
I did not even question you
about your identity!

166
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,650
I did not ask you your name!

167
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,490
I did not ask about your clan,
dynasty or future plans!

168
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,620
What did I do, Prince

169
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,560
that made
the situation difficult?

170
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,620
You are not at fault, Princess.

171
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,510
Maybe fate is at fault here.

172
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,650
Fate.

173
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Fate can be designed.

174
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,520
It is not definite, Prince.

175
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,560
My Govind says so himself.

176
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,390
That very fate

177
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,390
has been designed by my mother

178
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,490
by dividing you amongst
us five brothers.

179
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,450
Now, even if mother wants to

180
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,390
she cannot go back on her words.

181
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
I have

182
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,550
no answers to your
other questions, Princess.

183
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,390
I have only one request.

184
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,440
Please

185
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,420
marry my eldest brother.
