1
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,841
Soldiers!

2
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:19,711
Take the cavalry and fortify
the entrance gates.

3
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,813
Archers, assume
your posts at the

4
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,978
top of the gates
with fire arrows.

5
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:31,725
All infantry units, keep vigil
within the fort.

6
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:34,889
And the cavalry, outside
the fort, behind the hillock.

7
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:51,871
Close the fort's gate.

8
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,790
What is the news, Madan?
- It's a vast army, commander.

9
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,950
It flows like the tides
of the river Sindhu.

10
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,899
Infantry, cavalry and chariots
are endless in numbers.

11
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,965
Their heavy marching is
kicking up the dirt, sky high.

12
00:01:19,842 --> 00:01:21,969
They have rations and water for
the soldiers too, your majesty.

13
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,946
They seem to have prepared
for a lengthy conquest.

14
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:26,974
Whose army is it, soldier?

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,944
I couldn't see their banner,
your majesty.

16
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:31,743
But I could see the chariot
at their forefront.

17
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:32,845
It's a chariot of white horses

18
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,856
like that of the
Sun-God himself.

19
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,729
There's a white flag on the
chariot too, your majesty.

20
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,926
And on the flag is a golden
emblem of a Banyan tree.

21
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:49,733
That great man resembled
the blazing Sun-God himself.

22
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,803
He had an ornate armour
upon his body.

23
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,843
His arms are like
pillars of iron.

24
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,837
Eyes, intense as two fireballs.

25
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:03,850
And the seal of the moon
adorns his forehead.

26
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:09,722
Your highness, this warrior is
none else but the very son

27
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,989
of the great King Shantanu
and mother Ganga.

28
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:14,853
Bheeshma.

29
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:39,853
Mother, what is happening
around here?

30
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:43,983
Did you not hear?
Hastinapur has attacked.

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,784
What shall happen now,
mother?

32
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:49,763
Gandhar's army stands no chance
before Hastinapur's forces.

33
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,891
Streams of blood shall flow.
Within a matter of days

34
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,733
the fort of Gandhar shall
be reduced to rubble.

35
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:59,798
Accepting defeat even before
the battle isn't wise, Aarshi.

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,004
I beg your pardon,
your highness.

37
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:06,714
But Gandhar hasn't waged war
since many years.

38
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,916
So you aren't aware.

39
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:14,984
Demolishing defeated cities,
burning the homeless.

40
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:20,728
Killing the innocent and
violating the honor of women.

41
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,790
All these are unavoidable
in a war, Gandhari.

42
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,857
What shall we do now,
sister-in-law?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,969
What all the other women
do during battle.

44
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:33,941
Wait here for our
ultimate doom.

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,773
And then..

46
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,826
Sister-in-law.
Pick up a weapon.

47
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,802
I shall participate in the
battle alongside father.

48
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,808
Gandhari!
- Yes, mother.

49
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,907
This war terrifies me

50
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,875
as much as darkness does.

51
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,856
Sister-in-law, the great
teacher had taught us

52
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,917
that there is just one way
to overcome your fears.

53
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,989
Embrace that fear.

54
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,937
If death is inevitable

55
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,965
then I shall die
in the battlefield.

56
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:50,782
Fear always roots itself
within the human heart.

57
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:55,718
Sometimes, the fear
of losing wealth.

58
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,858
Sometimes, the fear
of humiliation.

59
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,887
Sometimes, the fear of being
separated from your loved ones.

60
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,954
Hence

61
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:07,759
presence of fear
seems normal to all.

62
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,896
Have you ever thought?

63
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:16,842
Is it that the situation
or the object that causes fear

64
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:20,006
is also the origin
of grief?

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,774
No.

66
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,717
There is no rule as such.

67
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,946
And everyone's experience
in fact tells

68
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:32,853
that being scared does not
solve problems in the future.

69
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:38,833
Fear is only the imagination
of the grief to come.

70
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,868
It has no relationship
with reality whatsoever.

71
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,707
Despite knowing that

72
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:49,968
fear is nothing but imagination

73
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:53,342
is it difficult to be free from

74
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,345
it and live fearlessly?

75
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,146
Think about it.

76
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:09,223
What are the orders,
your majesty?

77
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,362
It is time to respond to
the siege, your majesty.

78
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:17,331
The white banner of surrender
or the red banner of war!

79
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,301
Humiliation or death..

80
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:28,283
Never did these two colours
seem so dark, Shatasva.

81
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,181
But, your majesty.

82
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,411
We have to wave
one of these two banners.

83
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:41,163
The army has stopped
marching, your majesty.

84
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,199
Surprising indeed.

85
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,328
They're waving the yellow banner
of friendship, your majesty.

86
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:54,376
Open the gates of the fort.

87
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,219
If he wanted a dialogue,
why did he bring his army along?

88
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:20,131
Must be, to flaunt his power
before us.

89
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,234
But why?

90
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:26,205
Gandhar has done nothing
to cause insult to Hastinapur.

91
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:29,301
Hastinapur's throne has been
vacant for so long now.

92
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:32,143
After the death of
Emperor Vichitravirya

93
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,340
the kingdom has no king
for the past 25 years.

94
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,284
Yet, we never tried to
attack them.

95
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,213
We never allied with
any of their enemies.

96
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:46,126
Then, what was the need to
flaunt power before an ally?

97
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,289
Your majesty, Power is flaunted
before an ally

98
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,167
when one has some
demands to make.

99
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:56,128
What could a veteran such as
Bheeshma want from me?

100
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,816
A king should join hands
only before the Gods.

101
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:10,818
To embrace his allies and
to punish his foes

102
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,948
is what truly befits him,
king Subal.

103
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:15,883
Your heroic deeds aren't lesser

104
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:17,961
than that of a God,
Son of Ganges.

105
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,732
But I'm not a king. l'm just
a royal servant of Hastinapur.

106
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:26,893
My status isn't higher
than yours, your majesty.

107
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:29,739
Although you may
not be a king

108
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:32,833
your calibre is greater than
any emperor, son of Ganges.

109
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:36,003
Calibre comes into picture
only during a siege.

110
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:41,844
And I'm here,
to visit my friend's home.

111
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,919
To strengthen our friendship.

112
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,757
And to play host
to a friend like you

113
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,852
is the good fortune of
Gandhar, son of Ganges.

114
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:58,928
All hail Bheeshma,
the son of Ganges.

115
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:03,872
All hail Bheeshma,
the son of Ganges.

116
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,932
All hail Bheeshma,
the son of Ganges.

117
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,874
Sister-in-law.

118
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:10,937
Sister-in-law, Bheeshma
has arrived only to befriend us.

119
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,814
I heard so, princess.

120
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,853
A great calamity in Gandhar
has been averted.

121
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,788
What is your opinion,
sister-in-law?

122
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,785
Could he be masking
his intentions of war

123
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,920
behind the facade
of an alliance?

124
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,801
I've heard that Bheeshma
never lies, princess.

125
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,805
I've heard there is none
more powerful than him

126
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:36,830
among the Aryas.

127
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:37,862
Yes, Sugdha.

128
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,876
Even Parshuram
couldn't defeat him.

129
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:45,974
A powerful man is always calm
and composed.

130
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:48,876
Let's see for ourselves.

131
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:51,853
It shall be proved whether he is
truly powerful

132
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,983
or is it all just tall tales.
- I can't help but wonder

133
00:10:57,894 --> 00:10:59,919
what the powerful Bheeshma could

134
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,731
possibly demand from Gandhar.

135
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,725
Retire.

136
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,831
Looking at such a grand welcome
and vast affection

137
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:37,866
my heart is truly
overwhelmed.

138
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,965
I hope you have imbued
the same elegance and discipline

139
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,936
into your daughter
and daughter-in law too

140
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,945
Son of ganges, What could our
miniscule Gandhar offer

141
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:52,908
to the glorious and powerful
Kuru empire?

142
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,848
A future.

143
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,812
And the prospect of
happiness in that future.

144
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:04,921
Your majesty, you are aware that
no king has attacked you so far.

145
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,695
Because you have the protection
of the Kuru empire.

146
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:13,994
If the subjects of the
Kuru empire and Gandhar unite

147
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:17,967
then both the kingdoms shall
become incredibly powerful.

148
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,842
Think about it,
your majesty.

149
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:23,812
An alliance is formed between
two equally powerful kings.

150
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:26,814
Gandhar is a mere servant
to Hastinapur, son of Ganges.

151
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:30,719
Your majesty. Hence, l put forth
not an alliance, but a proposal.

152
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,857
A wedding proposal.

153
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:45,766
The whole Arya clan talks highly
of the beauty and virtues

154
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:47,861
of your daughter,
princess Gandhari.

155
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,966
I put forth a wedding proposal
for princess Gandhari.

156
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:03,718
Do not disappoint me.

157
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,946
But haven't you sworn yourself
to celibacy, son of ganges?

158
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:26,741
Princess Gandhari's proposal
is for a Kuru prince.

159
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:28,870
Not myself.

160
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,815
I consider Gandhari to
be my daughter.

161
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,927
I am in agreement
to this.

162
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,760
Who can be a better groom
than prince Pandu?

163
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,734
Prince Pandu's competence
and prowess are known to all.

164
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,905
Dhritarashtra.

165
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:03,946
Prince Dhritarashtra.

166
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,176
From where did prince Pandu
crop into the picture?

167
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:19,954
He is the younger son.

168
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:22,148
Prince Dhritarashtra
is the elder son.

169
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,082
Your majesty.

170
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,186
I am talking about
Prince Dhritarashtra.

171
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,193
Think it over, your majesty.

172
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:37,130
A hundred sons can be borne
even by a sculptor's wife.

173
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,134
They may build
a colossal house too.

174
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,942
But, not an entire kingdom.

175
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,947
The number of offsprings
is not important.

176
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,042
What matters

177
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:55,089
is the clan whose virtues and
upbringing they imbibe within.

178
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:01,085
Not every woman has the
good fortune to

179
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:05,224
bear a hundred sons
of the Kuru dynasty.

180
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:11,130
Oh, great one.

181
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:16,041
Gandhari is the most beautiful
princess in the world.

182
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:17,934
She is well versed
in many disciplines

183
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,039
and well trained
in combat too.

184
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:22,012
But prince Dhritarashtra

185
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,011
you know about him.

186
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:31,184
Prince Dhritarashtra
is capable in every aspect.

187
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,121
And there's no denying it.

188
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,067
You are not aware of
Dhritarashtra's brilliance

189
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:41,932
Queen Sudarbha.

190
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:47,165
Dhritarashtra's arms are so
powerful that with a single blow

191
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:49,934
he can knock down
many elephants at once.

192
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:55,014
Being crowned as Dhritarashtra's
queen, princess Gandhari

193
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:59,087
shall be the most fortunate
woman of the Arya race.

194
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,121
Where are you off to, princess?

195
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,997
It isn't the time
to leave us all, yet.

196
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:12,066
Let her go, Sugdha.

197
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,936
lt's expected of her
to be arrogant now.

198
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:18,139
There's a proposal for her from
such a huge kingdom, after all.

199
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:19,936
It's not so, sister-in-law.

200
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:23,042
Even if it's so, it's
understandable Gandhari.

201
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:25,946
There's no kingdom
in the entire world

202
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:29,141
that's more powerful
and wealthy than Hastinapur.

203
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:32,180
I too have heard great tales
about Hastinapur, princess.

204
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:36,023
I keep trying to imagine

205
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:38,186
how would Hastinapur be.

206
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:40,986
Hastinapur.

207
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:46,066
Tying this bond with Hastinapur,
you shall turn from king Subal

208
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,196
to emperor Subal.

209
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,166
That means, flaunting your power

210
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:57,136
you are here for a gain.
Isn't it, o great Bheeshma?

211
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,947
I'm here to induct the royal
family of Gandhar

212
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:02,109
into our family,
queen Sudarbha.

213
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:08,155
And within a family,
there is no question of gain.

214
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:12,126
There's only co-operation.

215
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,998
Gandhar cannot help Hastinapur
profit in any way.

216
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:21,101
Instead, Gandhar can only gain
from Hastinapur.

217
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,028
It may be a great kingdom
for all I know.

218
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,935
Even our Gandhar isn't
so weak either.

219
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:30,105
Anyway, a marriage takes place
with a prince, not the kingdom.

220
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,145
Oh!

221
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:36,150
So our princess is already
dreaming of her husband.

222
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:38,044
Sister-in-law.

223
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:44,158
In my opinion, the marriage
of princess Gandhari

224
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,997
and Prince Dhritarashtra is
ordained by the Gods.

225
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:52,157
Resolutions and options are
games a mind plays, king Subal.

226
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:56,198
But, I do not mean to
pressurize you in any way.

227
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:02,076
Only after clearing all your
doubts should you

228
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,011
arrive at a decision,
your majesty.

229
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:31,939
So, what have you decided,
your majesty?

230
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:51,922
The prince of Hastinapur seems
like Lord lndra among humans.

231
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:56,120
The subjects of the Kuru empire
consider their princes as Gods

232
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,159
and worship them
with all their heart.

233
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:10,207
Sister-in-law,
what is his name?

234
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:12,911
Why do you want to know
his name, princess?

235
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:16,140
Anyway, a wife never utters
her husband's name.

236
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,954
Sister-in-law, please tell me.
What is his name?

237
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:27,218
His name is Dhritarashtra.

238
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,101
Prince Dhritarashtra.
