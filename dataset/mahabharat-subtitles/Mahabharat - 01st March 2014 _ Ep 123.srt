1
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,110
Human!

2
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,210
There's human
in my land.

3
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,170
But I am not scared.

4
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,100
I have Lord Indra's blessings
with me.

5
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,230
On this land of mine

6
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,210
no human

7
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,040
can establish
his kingdom.

8
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,040
It's time to destroy them all.

9
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,160
Hail Nageshwar!*
*Shiva's first jyotirlinga/temple (the radiant sign of the almighty).

10
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,130
Is this the reward for
being kind?

11
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,040
If we had opposed
the partition

12
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,070
then they would be compelled
to coronate brother Yudhisthira

13
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,160
as the king of Hastinapur.

14
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,110
After a war, Nakul.

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,040
War is not a better choice
than partition.

16
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,170
Are you scared of battles,
brother Arjun?

17
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,970
A distinguished warrior is
always scared of war.

18
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,200
He doesn't fear
his death

19
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,970
but the loss
of other's lives.

20
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,970
If you're so concerned
for the lives of others

21
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,100
then make arrangements
for my meals.

22
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm dying out of hunger.

23
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,170
Let me first pay my obeisance
to Mother Earth

24
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,060
then I'll arrange for
the meals.

25
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,030
Mother Earth

26
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,100
accept the prayer of the ones

27
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,900
who wish to dwell in your
propinquity.

28
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,130
Bless us so that we perform
the veneration

29
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,000
with all our heart
and our hard work.

30
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,100
And we don't want
anything beyond our necessities.

31
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,130
We will always respect
the other living beings

32
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,040
who dwell in your shelter.

33
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,010
Bless our subjects with
peace and prosperity.

34
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,030
Run! Run! Run!

35
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,060
It's Takshak and his army.

36
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,130
Run! Run!
Oh God!

37
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,870
Brother we'll have to make use
of our weapons.

38
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,870
We'll have to protect
everyone.

39
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,030
Draupadi, you be
with the subjects.

40
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,900
Bhima, you and I will
protect the subjects.

41
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,100
Nakul, Sahdev, stay with Arjun.

42
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,040
Come on!

43
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,740
Vrushali!

44
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,810
V-Vrushali.
V-Vrushali.

45
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,830
Vrushali!
Vrushali.

46
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,740
Come on, run!

47
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,740
Wait, Takshaka!

48
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,930
There's no need for
you to attack.

49
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,810
We're not here to fight
a battle with you.

50
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,740
We all are the children
of Mother Earth.

51
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
All of us can live
here peacefully.

52
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,740
Father...
Father!

53
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,080
Why?

54
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,210
Why did all this happen,
Your Highness?

55
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,880
So many innocent people died.

56
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,010
They have been punished
for having chosen

57
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,100
the path of religion.

58
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,040
Why have they been punished
for having faith

59
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,940
in your potential,
Your Highness?

60
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,940
What enmity does
Takshaka have with us?

61
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,880
Calm down, Draupadi.

62
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,980
How can I calm down,
Your Highness?

63
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,100
Vrushali had said

64
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,040
that it's always the subjects
who have to sacrifice

65
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,110
for the welfare
of their king.

66
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,980
But, I had told her, then

67
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,910
that no

68
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,040
that will not happen
here on.

69
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
But, look

70
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
she's been proven right.

71
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,880
How can a kingdom nurtured
by so many deceased bodies

72
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,850
bring us welfare?

73
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,070
Have patience, Draupadi.

74
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,100
They aren't dead yet.

75
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,850
If the poison of the snakes is
removed at the earliest

76
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,000
then they all can be saved.

77
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,980
So...

78
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,940
So then get rid of
the poison, Prince.

79
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,810
What are we waiting for?

80
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,900
They are miraculous snakes,
Draupadi.

81
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,870
Only those snakes
who have bitten them

82
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,040
can remove this poison.

83
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,840
We will have to find
those snakes

84
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,880
before they succumb to it.

85
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,740
Where will we
find those snakes?

86
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,970
That evil Takshaka and his army
disappeared long ago.

87
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,900
To go and find each one...

88
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,880
We don't have
that much time.

89
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,870
Don't call them evil, Bhima.

90
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
This land was theirs.

91
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,970
Those snakes tried
to survive with the humans.

92
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,940
But they were not
benefitted at all.

93
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,850
They had to lose their land
and move to the forests.

94
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,940
That is the reason behind
Takshaka's enmity with humans.

95
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,810
When the rights of
the children of Mother Earth

96
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,830
are snatched from them

97
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,740
that's when rebellions like
Takshaka take birth.

98
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,950
You mean, Takshaka who
murdered so many humans

99
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,940
is not a sinner?

100
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,980
No.

101
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,840
Takshaka is not a sinner.

102
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,910
He has just lost
his path.

103
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,940
He is increasing the discord
between humans and snakes

104
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
which is benefitting no one.

105
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,900
And the entire snake clan
that is following him

106
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,940
are victims
and not criminals.

107
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,850
If we have decided
to establish a kingdom here

108
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,870
then along with
the humans

109
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,970
welfare of the snakes
too is our responsibility.

110
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,710
And if we do that

111
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,840
then the entire
clan of snakes

112
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,810
will love
and respect us.

113
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,700
All the snakes are hiding
in that forest, brother.

114
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,780
But the forest too
is filled with illusions.

115
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,900
You're right, Sahdeva.

116
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,780
A demon by the name
of Maya lives there

117
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,900
who is friends
with Takshaka.

118
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,800
He has created that illusion.

119
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,810
In front of brother
Arjun's weapons

120
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,830
all illusions fail, brother.

121
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,710
For that, we have to
fight a battle, Nakul.

122
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,870
With Lord Indra Himself.

123
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,340
Lord Indra!

124
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,370
Lord Indra

125
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,310
come and fulfill
your promise.

126
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,430
You had promised

127
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,200
that on this land

128
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
other than snakes

129
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,330
no one else shall dwell.

130
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,300
Today...

131
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,400
Today

132
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,360
on this land of snakes

133
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,430
the humans have come

134
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,330
to claim their rights.

135
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,310
Lord Indra!

136
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,400
Please, appear.

137
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,400
Please, appear before me.

138
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,310
You forgot

139
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
your promise

140
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,330
Lord Indra.

141
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,190
I haven't forgotten,
Takshaka.

142
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I have kept this land void
of water for such a long period

143
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,130
so that no one
other than you

144
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,190
can reside here.

145
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,170
But the humans who have
come here now

146
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,340
are divine.

147
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,400
The person who attacked
you with arrows

148
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,240
has taken birth because
of my blessings.

149
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,110
I consider him my son, Takshaka.

150
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,260
The essence of
five Gods

151
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,300
have given birth
to these five Pandavas.

152
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,300
Remember

153
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,330
no matter what
the circumstances be

154
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,200
you cannot defeat them.

155
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,230
But you can, Lord Indra.

156
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,190
Or is it

157
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,270
that after
seeing your son

158
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,140
you have become
blind in love.

159
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,330
Don't be foolish, Takshaka.

160
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,170
Realise the truth.

161
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,070
When water falls
at a certain place

162
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,230
it makes the place wet.

163
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,300
In the same manner

164
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,200
when there's competence

165
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,200
it finds a place
of its own.

166
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,160
I bind you

167
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,130
with your promise,
Lord.

168
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,270
Even if you have to

169
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,040
kill your own son

170
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,230
you can't break this promise.

171
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,140
You will have to
stop them.

172
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,240
Okay, Takshaka.

173
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,260
I cannot break my promise.

174
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,070
But remember

175
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,160
there are powers
in this world

176
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,200
that can defeat me.

177
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,230
I have been defeated
many a times.

178
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,100
King Nahusha

179
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,270
was a human.

180
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,230
He had defeated me.

181
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,200
If I am defeated
by the Pandavas

182
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,200
then you can be in
a much worse state.

183
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,170
You cannot be defeated, Lord.

184
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,100
I am

185
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,100
an illusive snake

186
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,010
and Mayasur has
made this forest

187
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,210
illusive too.

188
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,040
You just support us

189
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,230
by being the secret force.

190
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,070
We will shatter
all their dreams.

191
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,130
Yes

192
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,990
the snakes are blessed
with Lord Indra's protection.

193
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,070
And you're Lord Indra's Godson

194
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,970
an incarnation
and were born out of his traces.

195
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,160
You are his Godson.

196
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,040
Lord Indra is like
your father.

197
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,200
Will you be able to

198
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,970
fight a battle against him?
