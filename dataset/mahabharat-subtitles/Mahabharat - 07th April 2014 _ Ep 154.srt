1
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,250
When one's pride
is wounded

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,190
it reflects on the face first.

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,290
Show me
this imperious woman's face.

4
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,120
Your Highness

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,030
what kind of practice
is being conducted

6
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,290
at Hastinapur's
royal court?

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,030
I am the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru lineage.

8
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,030
I am the prestige
of the Kuru dynasty.

9
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,220
I had entered this city
as the pride of Hastinapur

10
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,060
Your Highness.

11
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,260
And I am being brought here
like some animal!

12
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,990
Why!

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,250
Grandsire

14
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,130
you're the most glorious one
in the whole of this kingdom.

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,260
You're Lady Ganga's son.

16
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,220
How can you remain silent
on seeing this kind of behaviour

17
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,130
being conducted
right in front of your eyes?

18
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,090
Guru Drona

19
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,190
you're a father figure to me.

20
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,020
Why am I being
treated like this?

21
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,120
Your Highness

22
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,930
your sons are defiling

23
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,990
and this is bringing
dishonour to you!

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,060
Why don't you stop them?

25
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,100
A maid
has to carry out

26
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,100
her master's orders.

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,150
Maid?

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,030
Am I a maid?

29
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,120
What makes me a maid?

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,960
My question has still not
been answered by Yudhisthira.

31
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,130
By losing himself in the game

32
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,990
he had lost his rights
on me.

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,950
Then how could he put
me at stake?

34
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,900
I question everyone
at this court...

35
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,150
What kind of
righteousness is this?

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,890
Why are you questioning
the court?

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,860
Ask your husband!

38
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,100
Slave Yudhisthira

39
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,990
answer her.

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,930
Answer me.

41
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,000
The rights with which
you put your brothers at stake

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,890
did you exercise the same rights
to put me at stake?

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,060
Yes, Draupadi.

44
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,030
Family members have a right
on each other.

45
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,930
A wife is not
a mere family member!

46
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Wife is the better half.

47
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,960
On a man's death

48
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,800
his family definitely
feels sad.

49
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,860
But it's only his wife
who becomes a widow.

50
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,960
Do pearls kept in a bowl
share the same relationship

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,990
as two pearls woven together
in an ornament?

52
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,000
Then how could you exercise
such rights on me

53
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,990
that you have
on your brothers?

54
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,960
Answer!
Don't be silent!

55
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,890
Minister Vidura

56
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,960
your kingdom is ruled
by justice.

57
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,860
You answer me.

58
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,930
Does your kingdom
give one's brothers

59
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,860
the right on his property?

60
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,850
If the person gives the right
to his brothers...

61
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,890
Then, yes.

62
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,960
Then the right
of the brother

63
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,860
is accepted.

64
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,800
It's the society that gives
a wife the right

65
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
on her husband's property.

66
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,960
The kingdom's law
gives her that right.

67
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,850
She receives those rights
as soon as she's married.

68
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,930
So, tell me, Minister.

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,920
When Yudhisthira
put his property at stake

70
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
I too had a right on it.

71
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,760
Then, why didn't he take
my permission?

72
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Answer me!
- Maid Draupadi

73
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,800
when all of you came to
Hastinapur to play this game

74
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,890
had you bound your five husbands

75
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,760
with any kind of restrictions?

76
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,890
No?

77
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,720
Then you have yourself

78
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,720
given your husbands the right

79
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,820
to lose all the property.

80
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,790
Now, stop rambling
for no reason.

81
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,630
This means

82
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,690
since I didn't bind my husbands
with any restrictions

83
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,850
it was my fault?

84
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,760
I trusted my husbands.

85
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,800
Was that a crime?

86
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,690
Answer me, Pandavas!

87
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,860
All of you have to answer
to all my questions

88
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,660
in this court
of unrighteousness.

89
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,730
Arjun

90
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,820
You answer me.

91
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,690
Had Yudhisthira taken
your permission

92
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,690
before losing me
in this gamble?

93
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,820
Did all of you
give the permission?

94
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,790
Have all of you together
made me a maid from an empress?

95
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,750
Answer!

96
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,660
You had taken the seven vows
of marriage from me

97
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,530
and in return

98
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,760
you had vowed
to protect me.

99
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,530
Did you forget all about that,
Pandavas?

100
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,600
For the sake
of your family's happiness...

101
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,600
So that four of you don't
have to lead an ascetic life

102
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,790
I have converted
my whole life into a penance.

103
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,650
And in return

104
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,490
why am I receiving

105
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,620
such a disgusting reward?

106
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,750
Why?

107
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,580
Forgive us, Draupadi.

108
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,590
Forgive us.

109
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,560
We

110
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,530
never go against our
elder brother's orders.

111
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,530
And brother Yudhisthira had to
give in to Duryodhan's orders.

112
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,530
Forgive us.

113
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,530
This means

114
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,660
you were being righteous.

115
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,590
Yudhisthira
was not unrighteous either.

116
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,600
Every person present
in this court

117
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,690
has abided by
righteousness.

118
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,500
So does righteousness means
dishonouring a woman?

119
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,660
Does righteousness give you men
the right to exploit a woman?

120
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,590
What was my fault

121
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,530
that I was brought here
in this manner?

122
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,500
Everybody did think about
being righteous in their own way

123
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,390
but no one thought

124
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,460
about my honour

125
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,430
My right

126
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,490
and my emotions.

127
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,590
No, they didn't
because your husbands

128
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,590
are not man enough.

129
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,400
Why are you relying

130
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,500
on such righteousness,
maid Draupadi

131
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,490
which makes these warriors

132
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,420
incompetent?

133
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Come

134
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,490
and establish a relationship
with me.

135
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,410
Come

136
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,250
and establish a relationship
with me.

137
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,280
It will give me happiness
and you...

138
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,420
Protection.

139
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,390
Come, maid Draupadi

140
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,380
be seated on my lap.
Come on!

141
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
Duryodhan

142
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,480
I will give you a death,
looking at which

143
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,410
the whole of earth
will tremble.

144
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,220
I will break your thighs
and take your life!

145
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,340
It's a promise!
It's a promise.

146
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,380
It's my promise!

147
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,420
And until I don't
destroy all of you

148
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,210
I will add mud
to the food I have.

149
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,180
So that it keeps reminding me

150
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,220
that I'm not a human

151
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,380
but an earthworm.

152
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,150
An earthworm!

153
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Don't ramble.

154
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,250
Come, maid Draupadi

155
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,410
and obey the orders
of your master.

156
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,310
Foolish Duryodhan!

157
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,210
I have taken birth from
the holy fire of Yajna.

158
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,190
And fire can
never be bound by anything.

159
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,180
You cannot make
me your slave

160
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,220
because that is not
acceptable to me.

161
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,380
I detest it!

162
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,270
Your Highness

163
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,120
in your court, a maid

164
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,090
is leaving

165
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,320
by dishonouring
her master's orders.

166
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,090
Wait, Draupadi!

167
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,210
Obey your master's orders.

168
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,110
Let her go, Your Highness.
Let her go.

169
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,150
For the sake of peace

170
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,150
we have tolerated
many an injustice.

171
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,090
Ignore this one too,
Your Highness.

172
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,080
Let her go.

173
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,070
Your Highness

174
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,120
a soldier who dares to stop
the wind forgets

175
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,210
that if the wind
forgot its limits

176
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,020
then the weapons
will be compelled to break.

177
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,180
It was decided to keep
unrighteousness in its limits.

178
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,010
Now, don't let unrighteousness
gain prominence.

179
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,180
Has it not been proved
in this court

180
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,180
that now, only Duryodhan
has the rights on Draupadi?

181
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,080
It was, Your Highness, but...
- There's no question

182
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,210
of an argument, Prime Minister.

183
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,020
If I give credibility to a
maid dishonouring her master

184
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,210
then all the maids and slaves
of this kingdom

185
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,180
will begin to insult
their masters.

186
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,190
On the mere basis
of a washer man's allegations

187
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,950
Lord Ram had asked Lady Sita
to take up an ordeal.

188
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,910
While here, there are many maids
and slaves who will protest.

189
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,150
It will upset the administration
of Hastinapur, Minister.

190
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,110
No.

191
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,980
Maid Draupadi will have
to obey

192
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,210
all of Duryodhan's orders.

193
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,430
Maid Draupadi will have
to obey

194
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,360
all of Duryodhan's
orders.

195
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,270
Maid

196
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,490
I order you

197
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,270
to come back.

198
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,240
Independence lies
within oneself, Duryodhan.

199
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,370
It's not a piece of clothing

200
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,400
that one can snatch.

201
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,300
You're so arrogant,
maid Draupadi

202
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,240
that you won't obey
your master's orders!

203
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,430
Independence cannot
be snatched

204
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,330
but clothes can certainly be.

205
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,330
Dushasana

206
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,210
The way she had us disarmed
at the court in Indrapastha

207
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,270
in front of the entire
Aryan lineage...

208
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,360
In the same manner

209
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,400
in this court

210
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,300
disrobe her!

211
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,130
Duryodhan!

212
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,340
Stay in your limits!

213
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,160
The way

214
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,330
this court has immersed
in darkness

215
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,300
similarly

216
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,300
Emperor Dhritarashtra

217
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,110
we will fill your life
with darkness!

218
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,300
We will fill it
with darkness!
