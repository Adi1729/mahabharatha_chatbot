1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,410
Vidur

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,220
I will not be returning to
Hastinapur with you.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,190
No, Queen Mother

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,160
you cannot take such
a big decision.

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,190
Hastinapur needs you.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,350
No, Vidur.

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,190
My endeavours have
been completed.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,220
Just like when a finger
is removed from the water

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,260
the void space is filled

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,120
my existence too

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,280
has been reduced
to the same.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,380
Now because of me

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,320
there will be no void
place in Hastinapur.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,120
Please leave, Vidur.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,280
In Ved Vyas' seminary

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,260
I shall spend the rest
of my life.

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,320
Please take Pandu's sons

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,160
and return to
Hastinapur.

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,380
Mother...
- Vidur...

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,180
This...is the order
of the Queen Mother.

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,320
Vidur

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,350
the Queen Mother has
one last order.

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,280
I had come here

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,190
to take the Kuru empire's
emperor along with me.

25
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,250
And you...

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,160
You are taking Kuru empire's
emperor along with you.

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,090
After today, it's
your responsibility

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,060
that Hastinapur's throne

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,160
sees Yudhishtir
as its king.

30
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,190
Go, Vidur.

31
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,020
Citizens!

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,150
The bereavement of Kuru empire's
former emperor, Pandu's death

33
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,120
can never be
forgotten.

34
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,010
But now

35
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,990
it's Emperor Dhritarashtra's
orders

36
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,030
that the one month long
bereavement period

37
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,060
has ended today.

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,180
Hence, in the entire
Kuru empire

39
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,080
business and trade

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,150
rituals

41
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,160
and blissful occasions

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,120
can begin all
over again.

43
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,120
And in this regard

44
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,980
His Highness has announced
the first celebration.

45
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,120
Two days from now

46
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,060
Prince Duryodhan's

47
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,060
enthronement as
the Crown Prince

48
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,160
will take place
in the assembly.

49
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,930
The public has
been ordered

50
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,960
that on this blissful
occasion

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,030
the entire Kuru empire
may have festivities.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
King Dhritarashtra!

53
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,930
King Dhritarashtra!

54
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,080
King Dhritarashtra!

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,090
Hail King Pandu!

56
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,030
Child, it's not,
'Hail King Pandu'.

57
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,990
It's 'Long live King Pandu'.

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,090
Long live King Pandu.

59
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,020
Long live King Pandu.

60
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,890
Long live King Pandu.

61
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,930
It's twelve again...
- Kind attention!

62
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,930
His Excellency Bhishma
is arriving!

63
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,890
Disperse!

64
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,880
Greetings, grandsire.

65
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,020
Greetings.

66
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,050
You should have
called for me.

67
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,060
I have come here

68
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,890
to play the game of dice,
Gandhar Prince.

69
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,890
I have heard

70
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,020
that a game of dice
offers peace to the mind.

71
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,820
Peace...

72
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,880
Peace!

73
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,050
Definitely, Your Excellency.

74
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,820
But still

75
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,820
you could have
called for me.

76
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,790
Why did you take
the trouble of coming here?

77
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,880
I haven't taken
any trouble.

78
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,860
My shoulders have been
burdened with troubles.

79
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,760
Whose was so impudent,
Your Excellency?

80
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,050
By the orders
of His Highness

81
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,990
I will have him prisoned.

82
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,790
I can do this myself,
Prince Shakuni.

83
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,850
A deceiver of
the Kuru lineage and empire

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,920
can be reduced to cinders by me
just by my gaze.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,980
And to do this task

86
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,720
you don't even require

87
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,950
the permission

88
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,750
of His Highness!

89
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,880
Be seated,
Your Excellency.

90
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Please...

91
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,920
Please have a seat.

92
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,920
Who will throw the dice first,
Your Excellency? - Me!

93
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,920
Because

94
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,690
Prince

95
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,920
you have begun
many a game already.

96
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,860
Your scores aren't sufficient,
Your Excellency.

97
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,950
How many points are
sufficient, Prince Shakuni?

98
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,920
A minimum of

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,950
six points,
Your Excellency.

100
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,730
Do you have the requisite score?

101
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,660
Indeed, I do,
Your Excellency.

102
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,820
One.

103
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,830
King Pandu has passed
away, Your Excellency

104
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,800
hence King Dhritarashtra is
no more the de facto king.

105
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,720
He is now

106
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,760
the Emperor.

107
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,860
Two.

108
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,660
King Dhritarashtra

109
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,630
loves his son a lot.

110
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,890
Three.

111
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,890
His Highness has complete
faith in my devotion.

112
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,620
Four.

113
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,730
His Highness' orders

114
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,630
for you, are tantamount
to God's testament

115
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,650
Your Excellency.

116
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,620
Five.

117
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,590
People's associations
are misguided now

118
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,560
due to the absence
of the Chief Minister.

119
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,790
Six.

120
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,590
The Emperor's satisfaction
lies in

121
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,560
Duryodhan's enthronement

122
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,780
as the Crown Prince.

123
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,360
Now let me disclose my
six points to you

124
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,480
Prince Shakuni.

125
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,550
One.

126
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,480
As per Kuru empire's traditions

127
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,450
before a prince
completes his education

128
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,450
a coronation ceremony
is unviable.

129
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,320
Two.

130
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,510
Without
the people's associations

131
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,280
ministry

132
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,510
and the justice council

133
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,320
being consulted

134
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,310
even the king can't
take a decision on his own.

135
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,450
Three.

136
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,290
Pandu has passed away.

137
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,310
But Queen Mother is still alive.

138
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,290
Four.

139
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,290
Your father, King Subal,
seems to be unhealthy.

140
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,390
Returning to Gandhar
and managing the kingdom

141
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,290
are your foremost duties now.

142
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,390
Five.

143
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,520
I have vowed to protect
the Kuru throne.

144
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,410
And, six.

145
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,390
Orders not to kill you

146
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,220
haven't yet been given to me
by His Highness.

147
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,280
One more thing.

148
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,350
Whether it's Dhritarashtra's
son becoming the king

149
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,210
or Pandu's, I shall not
be partial to either of them.

150
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,360
But Kuru empire's tradition
shan't be broken either.

151
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,220
Prince Shakuni

152
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,310
I am aware

153
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,220
that Dhritarashtra is
heavily influenced by you.

154
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,310
Until Pandu's sons
don't return

155
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,250
the coronation of
the Crown Prince shan't happen.

156
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,350
Please convey the same
to him, yourself.

157
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,160
Or else, do remember,
Prince Shakuni.

158
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,220
An elephant stops in its tracks
on spotting a mouse.

159
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,160
That accounts for compassion,
not weakness.

160
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,120
Disperse.

161
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,380
My Lord,
I have a request.

162
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,110
If it's regarding Duryodhan's
coronation, let it be.

163
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,310
I have already decided.

164
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,350
How could you decide without
consulting the Chief Minister?

165
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,110
Chief Minister?

166
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,160
The one who had objected to
my coronation

167
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,310
will never let my son
be coronated!

168
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,220
I trust Vidur.
He is never unjust...

169
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,310
You could trust him,
Gandhari

170
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,150
because you weren't
born sightless

171
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,280
rather you've just
blindfolded yourself!

172
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,350
But I was born blind.

173
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,090
My distrust is my wealth
and my power!

174
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,250
Thus, instead of trusting
and regretting later

175
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,310
I prefer distrusting and getting
my wishes fulfilled!

176
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,050
Right, Shakuni?

177
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,220
Didn't I speak the truth?
- Indeed, Your Highness.

178
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,290
But does His Highness distrust
his son too? - Shakuni!

179
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,080
The subjects say so,
Your Highness.

180
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,060
It's the hearsay of the subjects
as to what such was an urgency

181
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,250
to coronate the prince
as the Crown Prince.

182
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,150
Or if His Highness was so weak

183
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,090
to have his desire fulfilled
through the Chief Minister.

184
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,180
Is Vidur the de jure king?

185
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Your Highness, my heart
was shattered on hearing this.

186
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,020
But mere subjects
have less wit

187
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,180
and more power. What can
be done? - What do you mean?

188
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,090
Your Highness, I mean, only
after the Chief Minister returns

189
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,990
do we announce the Crown Prince.
- But, Shakuni, you had said...

190
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,050
I was an imbecile,
Your Highness. A mere fool.

191
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,020
Whilst worrying about
your well-being

192
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,250
I guided you over to
a path leading to sorrows.

193
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,050
Forgive me, Your Highness.
Forgive me.

194
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,160
But the rumours within a city

195
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,080
are like the stench of garbage.

196
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,220
They ride the winds
and go about.

197
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,020
Now your prestige deems it,
Your Highness

198
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,120
that in a packed assembly

199
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,160
you get the Chief Minister
to announce the Crown Prince.

200
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,960
So that it's made apparent to
the subjects of the province

201
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,160
that you are their king
in actuality.

202
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,090
But, Your Highness,
the question still stays

203
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,060
that if the Chief Minister

204
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,220
could be enforced to
make this announcement.

205
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,180
If Vidur refuses
to announce

206
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,050
I shall have him decapitated!

207
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,920
I am a king

208
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,160
not a puppet to be
pulled around by strings.

209
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,180
Your Highness.

210
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,960
I'm not able to understand
why you changed your colours.

211
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,080
But the impeding of coronation
benefitted the Kuru lineage.

212
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,960
My intentions aren't
any such, dear Gandhari.

213
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,920
I have changed just my colours

214
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,150
not my oath.

215
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,910
The king to the throne
of Hastinapur

216
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,990
will be Duryodhan only.

217
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,930
At any cost.
Any at all.

218
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't go, Karna.

219
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,900
Son, even if you
do learn archery

220
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,930
what could you
possibly achieve by that?

221
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Think about your mother
for a moment. Don't go, son.

222
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,070
I have promised you, mother.
I will return soon

223
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,940
after I have mastered
all skills.

224
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,070
No, son.

225
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,810
Now you will never return,
Karna.

226
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,010
Kuru province doesn't harbour
any Suta warrior.

227
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,960
But, my lord...

228
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,980
Why are you asking my son
to give up his homeland?

229
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,910
This is the desire
of His Excellency.

230
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,830
That Karna fulfils
the probability he was born for.

231
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,840
He wishes to master archery.

232
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,030
So he must give it a try.

233
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,970
I do not just wish
to achieve mastery!

234
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,930
In this very land,
within these very people

235
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,810
I wish to be hailed
as a maestro!

236
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,840
What use is success,
unless people accept it?

237
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,840
I am going to attain knowledge,
father.

238
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Tradition being the pretense to
destroy my skill, isn't a right

239
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,930
of the Kuru empire subjects.

240
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,800
I am leaving Hastinapur
only for a short while.

241
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,910
I am not giving up
the Kuru land.

242
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,840
I shall live in this very
Kuru province.

243
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,740
One among the skill centres
of Kuru province

244
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,940
will be my alma mater.
This is my solemn oath.

245
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,900
That means, you will clash
with the subjects?

246
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,880
A toad doesn't grow big enough
by puffing out its cheeks

247
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,780
that it may clash with a bull.

248
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,810
That is what I wish to discover,
father.

249
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,780
Am I a toad or a Taurus?

250
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,780
Even if I waste a lifetime in
a quest to discover my calibre

251
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,670
I shall gladly accept it.

252
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,780
Bless me, mother.

253
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,730
Father

254
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,770
I shall prove Your Excellency
Bhishma's advice wrong

255
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,900
and return soon.

256
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,710
And I will live right here,
in Hastinapur

257
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,700
lifelong.

258
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,830
Son...
