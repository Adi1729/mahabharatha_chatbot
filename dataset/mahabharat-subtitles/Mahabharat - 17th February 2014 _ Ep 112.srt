1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,670
I am going away

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,800
to another home to become
its fortune, father.

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,640
May fortune always reside
in this abode of yours.

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,640
I pray to the Almighty for this.

5
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,660
Bless you!
Bless you.

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,800
May you become the valour
and motivation of your husbands.

7
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,770
May you become the basis
of their righteousness.

8
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,570
Bless you, daughter!

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,670
I shall always be there
to protect you, Draupadi.

10
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,710
And I shall always pray for
your safety, Dhrishtadyumna.

11
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,700
Deeming the reverence
towards you my wealth

12
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,680
I am leaving this place, Govind.

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,670
Keep protecting and testing

14
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,670
my righteousness.

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,670
Certainly, dear.

16
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,670
I have firm faith in you.

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,470
Do remember

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,540
that a husband's love
reflects in his valour

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,440
and that of a wife

20
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,670
in her patience.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,540
This also has another meaning.

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
In testing times,
a husband must be patient

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,570
and a wife must display valour.

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,600
Go on, dear.

25
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,630
Because of you,
the entire Kuru dynasty

26
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,510
will get cleansed and purified.

27
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,410
If you too would have
accompanied us to Hastinapur

28
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,600
then it would have been
wonderful, Vasudev.

29
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,610
My hands are tied, Yudhishthir.

30
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,510
I must return to Dwaraka.

31
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,410
I look forward
to meeting you, Madhav.

32
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,410
We shall meet soon, friend.

33
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,470
Very soon.

34
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,610
But do remember something.

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,470
'Yato Dharma Tato Jaya.'

36
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,340
Victory is

37
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,530
where righteousness prevails.

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,310
'This is a difficult path'

39
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,380
'but it is my fate.'

40
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,470
'May I fulfill my vows'

41
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,410
'and that is all I pray for.'

42
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,310
'I am surrounded
by uncertainties'

43
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,400
'but I must remain
firm in my oath.'

44
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,310
'May it be successful'

45
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,250
'and this is what I pray for.'

46
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,240
Greetings, Minister Vidur.

47
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,270
Greetings, Vasudev.

48
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,310
I seek your permission...

49
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,360
Vasudev

50
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,340
a maiden

51
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,310
got married to five men!

52
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,430
Five?

53
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,380
The Pandavas are not five
in number, Minister Vidur.

54
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,430
They are five forms
of the same power

55
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,370
like the five faced Panchamukhi* Hanuman.
*'Five-faced', a metaphorical representation of various traits or characters.

56
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,170
And them staying united

57
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,470
is in the best interest
of everyone.

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,370
But Vasudev...
- No.

59
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,370
There is no place for any doubt,
Minister Vidur.

60
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
The Pandavas

61
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,330
have the strength
to brave all challenges.

62
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,430
Granted that their life
will not be all that easy

63
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,210
but I can certainly say

64
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,400
that it shall indeed
be successful.

65
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,270
Be patient and follow
the righteous path

66
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,310
to safeguard the throne
of Hastinapur, Minister.

67
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,330
The Aryan region will experience
a great turmoil, Minister

68
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,210
and the throne of Hastinapur

69
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
will be at the centre.

70
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,310
'Do you know how far you are
from the throne'

71
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,270
'from where you are standing?'

72
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
'51 steps.'

73
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,110
'Do you know how I know this?'

74
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,330
'Because ever since I was born,
my destination'

75
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,300
'has always been this throne.'

76
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
'The name of my son will be'

77
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,130
'Duryodhan!'

78
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,180
'My son!
My heir'

79
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,170
'will be invincible, mother!'

80
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,270
'Every first born son
is the heir to his father.'

81
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,270
'In order to inherit
his father's property'

82
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,110
'the son of a shepherd
need not wait to be anointed.'

83
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,130
'Father may have
honoured the throne'

84
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,100
'but to honour its greatness'

85
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,270
'is a right he does not have.'

86
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,210
'Then what is the meaning
of presiding over it, mother?'

87
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
'In order to honour
the greatness of the kingdom'

88
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,030
'many Kings have
given up their lives.'

89
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,110
'Then can you'

90
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,070
'not give up your kingdom,
father?'

91
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,080
'Get me anointed, father!'

92
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,230
'I cannot live
with this insult.'

93
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,240
'Today, this sword will
either behead this horse'

94
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,100
'or your son.'

95
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,040
My Lord.

96
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,930
Do you know

97
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,130
what the distance between

98
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,130
you and the throne is, Gandhari?

99
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,170
51 steps, My Lord.

100
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,200
No.

101
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,010
You are
only seven steps away.

102
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,070
And...

103
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,100
And those seven steps

104
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,130
are called Seven Hells,
Gandhari.

105
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,940
While making one's way
to the throne

106
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,170
one experiences seven hells.

107
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,070
But today...

108
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,110
Today, I

109
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,140
saw the seventh hell, Gandhari

110
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,910
when my own son

111
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,030
told me to resort to asceticism.

112
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,770
My...

113
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,840
My own...

114
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,940
My own Duryodhan
told me so, Gandhari.

115
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,900
The fault must

116
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,980
certainly be mine, My Lord.

117
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,810
A mother imparts values
to her children.

118
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,910
And a father is his son's ideal.

119
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,910
So, is it the fault
of his values or his ideal?

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I am unable to figure
it out, Gandhari.

121
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,970
You

122
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,930
can still refuse him, My Lord.

123
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,840
That is something
I cannot do, Gandhari.

124
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,740
That is something I cannot do.

125
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,000
In the entire Kuru dynasty,
till date

126
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,780
no son has ever revolted
against his father.

127
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,810
But Duryodhan's ambitions
have inflated so much

128
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,710
that he will break traditions
and revolt against his father

129
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,940
Gandhari.

130
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,810
He...
He will revolt.

131
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,800
He will revolt.

132
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,900
He will not revolt, My Lord.

133
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,810
I have firm faith

134
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,910
that he has

135
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,900
love and respect for us
within him.

136
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,810
Gandhari

137
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,900
people ask for the throne
for their sons

138
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,840
but I had asked for a son
for the throne from you.

139
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,710
Duryodhan is certainly my heir

140
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,740
but...

141
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,800
But he could

142
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,880
not become my son,
Gandhari.

143
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,770
He could not become
my son, Gandhari.

144
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,600
He...

145
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,900
He will certainly take to arms
against me, Gandhari.

146
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,840
He will certainly do so.

147
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,640
The poison of my ambitions

148
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,840
also runs through his veins.

149
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,770
The plants that grow
near the ocean

150
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,610
are also salty, Gandhari.

151
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,640
They too are salty.

152
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,810
My Duryodhan wants

153
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,870
me to anoint him.

154
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,800
I have taken a decision,
Gandhari.

155
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,700
Tomorrow

156
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,580
at dawn

157
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,810
I will anoint him, Gandhari.

158
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,650
I shall indeed do so.

159
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,090
Kripacharya

160
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,180
let the anointment ceremony

161
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,150
begin.

162
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,240
Pardon me, Your Highness

163
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,210
but I request you

164
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,990
to wait for the great Bhishma.

165
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,050
Taking such a big decision

166
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,990
in his absence
will be incorrect.

167
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,110
Sometimes, even the incorrect

168
