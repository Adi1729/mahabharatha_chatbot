1
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,460
'A Few Days Later.
Hastinapur.'

2
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,460
After many years,
we have been blessed

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,360
with a suitable reward for our
labour throughout the year.

4
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,390
And this time, we have also
had a good amount of rain.

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,450
People are obtaining
more money these days.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,330
Hence, they are becoming
more prosperous.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,490
No wonder they are buying grains
from us at a higher price.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,550
Ever since the son of Pandu,
Yudhishthir

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,530
became the Crown Prince even
the Gods are pleased with him.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,430
The ogres used to cause
nuisance near the borders

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,360
but Prince Arjun has
put an end to it.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,420
Friend, the entire
kingdom is safe.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,360
What more could
the subjects ask for?

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,420
Just safety and prosperity.

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,550
It's nothing but the majesty of
the Crown Prince, Yudhishthir.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,390
You are correct.

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,360
Greetings, uncle.

18
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,550
May glory be yours.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,490
Greetings, brother Yudhishthir.

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,450
Bless you.

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,460
To see the Kuru Princes
become fond of each other

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,300
gives me immense
happiness, Minister.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Had the King of Gandhar
not been in Hastinapur

24
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,490
I too would have
thought so, Kripacharya.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,250
He must certainly be scheming
to disrupt Hastinapur's peace.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,230
'The spider shown in this scene'

27
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,490
'has been generated
through computer graphics.'

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,330
A spider works very hard
to spin a web.

29
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,300
How does it aid the spider?

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,290
Have you ever thought
about it, Dusshasan?

31
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,380
No, uncle.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,320
The enemy submits before it
on his own free will.

33
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,260
He moves slowly
towards his death.

34
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,290
He becomes utterly helpless.

35
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,260
He squirms about.

36
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,360
But he is
unable to do anything.

37
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,230
In the end

38
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,230
he gives up his life.

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,230
This gives one unparalleled joy,
beloved Dusshasan.

40
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,250
The day our enemies

41
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,260
decide to go to Varnavrat* themselves
*A forest, present day Barnava.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,300
that day I too

43
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,390
shall experience
such contentment.

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,290
Purochan has made
all the arrangements

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,190
as per your plan.

46
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,300
The Pandavas will
certainly go to Varnavrat

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,190
but they will
never return, uncle.

48
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,260
But

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,350
what if the Pandavas refuse
to go to Varnavrat?

50
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,290
The Crown Prince can be given

51
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,090
such an order
only by His Highness.

52
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,320
There won't be any need
to give such an order.

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Yudhishthir himself
will ask for the permission

54
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,130
or he will have to see
with his precious eyes

55
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,130
the supremacy of Hastinapur

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
get crumbled into dust.

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,150
I do not understand, brother.
- Dusshasan!

58
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,320
My beloved!

59
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,100
When you strike at
the flat end of a nail

60
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,220
the pointed end
sinks into the earth.

61
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,160
When it comes to the cornerstone
of righteousness in Hastinapur

62
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,160
your grandsire Bhishma
is like a nail's flat end

63
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,130
while the pointed end is
Crown Prince Yudhishthir.

64
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,260
If you strike at your grandsire

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,160
then Yudhishthir will be
forced to sink into the earth.

66
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,220
Insult that old geyser

67
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,230
and keep at it,
my beloved nephews!

68
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,150
That is our plan's second stage.

69
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,290
And the first stage
of this insult

70
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,090
involves Dushala's marriage.

71
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Sukta, I was awaiting you.

72
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,020
You are my eyes.

73
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,200
Just look at these ornaments.
Aren't they beautiful?

74
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,100
I had these made for
Dushala's 'swayamvar.'

75
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
'Swayamvar?'

76
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,020
Princess Dushala cannot have
a 'swayamvar,' Her Highness.

77
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,150
Why?

78
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,960
Do you not know?

79
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,200
Everyone in the palace
is discussing this.

80
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,190
Prince Duryodhan has announced
Princess Dushala's marriage

81
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,120
to Jayadratha,
the King of Sindhu.

82
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,990
How can that be possible?

83
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,030
Sindhu has had enmity
with Hastinapur for ages.

84
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,950
His Highness and uncle Bhishma

85
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,030
will never agree to it.

86
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,960
That is impossible,
brother Duryodhan.

87
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,890
Dushala cannot be married to
Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu.

88
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,030
Without even seeking permission

89
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,930
how could you propose this
marriage to the King of Sindhu?

90
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,050
The decision to have
my sister married

91
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,090
is my personal matter.

92
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,930
Mulling over Princess Dushala's
marriage and its consequences

93
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
is the duty of the Ministers,
Prince Duryodhan.

94
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,960
You are well aware

95
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,020
that only those kings are
invited to a 'swayamvar'

96
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,990
with whom forming
personal relationships

97
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,890
does not adversely
affect the kingdom.

98
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I do not wish to turn
my sister's marriage

99
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,080
into politics, Minister.

100
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,050
Prince Duryodhan

101
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,970
we shall forge no relationship
with either Magadha or Sindhu.

102
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,930
And this has always been
the policy of our kingdom.

103
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,860
The duty of carrying out
the policies of the kingdom

104
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,950
is that of brother Yudhishthir.

105
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,860
He is the Crown Prince.

106
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,050
Not me.

107
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,890
To me,
the happiness of my sister

108
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,060
is above all else.

109
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,830
Princess Dushala
is not only your sister

110
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,020
but also the daughter
of His Highness.

111
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,050
Water is water

112
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,900
whether is it found
in a river or a pitcher.

113
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,890
However, only river water
is worshipped

114
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,830
and not the water in a pitcher.

115
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,830
The values and duties
of a person

116
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,860
are determined
based on his rank.

117
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,990
It is essential
to have a Princess

118
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,020
married through the mode
of a 'swayamvar.'

119
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,960
Sage Vashishtha was married

120
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,900
to the Princess of Vidarbha,
Lopamudra, Bhishma

121
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,830
because it was Lopamudra's wish.

122
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,730
Then why can't beloved Dushala

123
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,730
marry the King of Sindhu
out of her free will?

124
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,760
But of course

125
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,730
you have always used
your sense of duty

126
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,990
to crush the desires and wishes

127
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,990
of everyone around you.
- King of Gandhar!

128
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,760
Watch what you are saying.

129
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,900
Insulting grandsire

130
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,760
was not uncle's intentions,
uncle Vidur.

131
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,700
The sense of duty
is the most supreme

132
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,760
and toughest in the world.

133
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,820
But we ordinary people

134
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,890
cannot execute such
a tough task, Minister.

135
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,760
The Prince is correct, Minister.

136
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,920
The Lord of Sun burns himself

137
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,690
in order to
illuminate the world.

138
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,860
The moon does not have
the power to burn.

139
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,790
Hence, it cannot
illuminate the earth.

140
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,730
It can only provide coolness.

141
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,850
A person who did not marry

142
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,820
cannot be expected to

143
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,800
understand the affection
for one's family.

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,140
A person who did not marry

145
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,920
cannot be expected to

146
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,080
understand the affection
for one's family.

147
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,140
I did not get married

148
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,080
because the sons and
grandsons of my brother

149
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,840
are my family, King of Gandhar.

150
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,050
And King Dhritarashtra knows it.

151
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,820
The heart pumps blood
through the body.

152
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,010
And the heart beats
because of the blood.

153
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,910
The way the heart and the blood

154
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,810
cannot be separated.

155
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,050
Similarly

156
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,810
the progeny of the Kuru dynasty
and I are not different.

157
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,010
King of Gandhar

158
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,810
do remember.

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,950
The sense of duty is borne of
affection and compassion.

160
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,850
And Prince Duryodhan

161
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,910
it is the love of the Sun God

162
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,710
that makes him burn himself in
order to illuminate the world.

163
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,840
Indeed, uncle Vidur.

164
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,010
But it is also true
that the light of the sun

165
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,780
gives birth to vegetation

166
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,720
while that of the moon
gives birth to herbs.

167
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,750
In other words

168
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,800
that which is valuable

169
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,750
stems from the sense of duty

170
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,870
or love?

171
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,780
Brother Duryodhan

172
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,710
there is no point
to a discussion now.

173
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,720
Grandsire has said that
Dushala will have a 'swayamvar'

174
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,820
and his words are
like an order to us!

175
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,750
It may be an order
to you, Crown Prince

176
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,720
and to the Ministers of the
royal court of Hastinapur

177
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,770
but not to me.

178
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,780
The truth is, we have
a major dilemma at hand.

179
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,810
But it is not a dilemma for me

180
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,600
because I am

181
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,880
not the Crown Prince.

182
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,800
It is a dilemma for you

183
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,910
but I am the son
of His Highness!

184
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,770
You cannot curtail
any of my actions.

185
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,780
But I can curtail your actions.

186
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,610
A waterfall erodes the earth.

187
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,680
The earth can never be
an obstacle to a waterfall.

188
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,320
Grandsire.

189
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Beloved Yudhishthir

190
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,220
once, Goddess Parvati had closed

191
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,420
Lord Shiva's eyes
out of playfulness.

192
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,450
And at that moment

193
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,360
the entire creation had
plunged into darkness.

194
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,250
And from that darkness

195
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,230
was born a demon called Andhak.

196
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,330
And he began tormenting
the entire creation.

197
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,380
It was a grim situation
for the Gods.

198
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,380
The son of Lord Shiva
and Goddess Parvati

199
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,160
could be killed only by
Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.

200
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,230
We are in a similar situation.

201
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,380
Back then, Lord Shiva had
salvaged the world, grandsire.

202
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,230
Dhritarashtra cannot
curtail his son's actions.

203
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,250
Or maybe

204
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,190
he does not have
the desire to do so.

205
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,380
There is only one solution
to this situation, grandsire.

206
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,260
You must take a decision,
grandsire.

207
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,160
You must ask me to step down
as the Crown Prince

208
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,260
and declare Duryodhan
as the new Crown Prince.

209
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,350
Otherwise he will
keep doing such things.

210
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,230
He will approach the Kings
who are not the allies of Kuru

211
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,280
and befriend them.

212
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,150
And he will forge an enmity

213
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,320
with the Kings
who are our allies.

214
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,120
He will keep posing such
problems for us, grandsire.

215
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,190
Are you scared of
such problems, Yudhishthir?

216
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,320
I did not expect this from you.

217
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,060
Your insult scares me,
grandsire.

218
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,230
And Duryodhan will
keep posing situations

219
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,190
where you will be insulted.

220
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,260
And do you believe, you stepping
down as the Crown Prince

221
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,280
will add to my respect?

222
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,220
Yudhishthir

223
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,120
I had promised my father

224
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,060
that until the kingdom
of Hastinapur

225
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,320
would find a righteous
and brave king

226
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,220
I would continue
this struggle of mine.

227
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,020
And if

228
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,150
you step down
as the Crown Prince

229
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
and despite your presence

230
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,190
I have to declare Duryodhan
as the Crown Prince

231
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,250
then my promise
will go unfulfilled.

232
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,090
My lifelong struggle
will go in vain.

233
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,190
And this...

234
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,120
This will be
the biggest insult to me.

235
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,250
Until you are alive

236
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,130
you cannot forsake Hastinapur.
