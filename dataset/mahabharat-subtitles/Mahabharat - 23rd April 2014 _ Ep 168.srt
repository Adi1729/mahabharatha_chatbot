1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,410
Tonight,
the Pandavas

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,340
will slay Kichak.

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,350
I am awaiting

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,250
the sound of the duel
between Bheem and Kichak

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,220
to reach my ears.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,220
Then we shall leave immediately

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,280
and render the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,270
futile.

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,370
Let's go,
Princess.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,220
I shall give you a lesson in the Rudra Tandava* tonight.
*Divine Shiva dance which depicts his violent nature, first as the creator and later as the destroyer of the universe, even of death itself.

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,340
At this hour?

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Yes, Princess.

13
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,440
The appropriate time
to assume the Rudra form

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,270
is tonight and at this hour.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,420
Soldiers,
stay right here

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,280
and do remember

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,410
that no one is allowed
inside this chamber.

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,210
Why is the chamber
so dark, Sairandhri?

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
What are you up to?

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,220
If you think your husbands
will kill me

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,340
right here in this chamber

22
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,110
then you are making
a very big mistake.

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,280
Let me

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,080
illuminate the chamber.

25
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,340
In order to have light

26
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,280
one must endure
the heat of fire, Kichak.

27
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,340
In order to get rid of

28
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,050
the darkness in your mind

29
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
you too must burn.

30
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,070
You are foolish.

31
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,050
This is neither Panchal
nor Hastinapur

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,070
but the kingdom of Matsya

33
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,310
and the courage to kill me

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,110
resides within no one here.

35
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,180
Bheem?

36
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,210
You could recognize Panchali

37
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,170
but not me?!

38
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,050
Do you wish to engage in a duel?

39
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,170
Do not be foolish,
Bheem.

40
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,210
If you are defeated

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,010
then you will be killed.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,950
However,
if I get defeated

43
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,080
then all of you will have to

44
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,950
go on an exile for twelve years

45
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
Yet again.

46
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,050
It would be better

47
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,010
if you seek my refuge

48
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,950
and leave Draupadi
here with me.

49
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,920
Even if it is stuck in the mud

50
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,120
an elephant is still
a majestic being, Kichak!

51
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,080
Neither can hundred dogs
provide it with protection

52
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,010
nor can they harm it.

53
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
And I am not stuck
anywhere either.

54
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,050
I am utterly free

55
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,110
to punish you!

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,140
I will have to call out
to Duryodhan just once

57
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,970
and he shall
be here immediately.

58
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,880
Only when your voice
leaves this chamber

59
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,080
will Duryodhan be able
to hear you, fool!

60
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,980
That is the sound
of Brihannala's feet.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,850
The rhythm of Tandava
will spell out your doom.

62
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,040
Those are the horses
of Damgranthi.

63
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Listen carefully!

64
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,910
Their neigh is ushering
your death at lightning speed.

65
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,880
Those are the cows of Tantripal.

66
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,870
They are announcing
your punishment!

67
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,970
Listen!

68
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,920
You cannot leave
this place, Kichak.

69
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,720
Then how will you send
a message to Duryodhan?

70
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,810
Do you hear that,
my darling?!

71
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,840
Who could be making
such sounds at this hour?

72
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,870
They are indeed the Pandavas!

73
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,780
The Pandavas?

74
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,780
Why would the Pandavas produce
such sounds at this hour, uncle?

75
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,880
So that we fail to hear
Kichak's screams

76
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,810
while they kill him.

77
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,680
Let's go,
my darling.

78
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,910
We must save Kichak.

79
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,680
After killing Kichak

80
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,780
if the Pandavas hide themselves

81
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,720
then we will never
be able to find them.

82
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,650
If we apprehend the Pandavas now

83
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,680
then we will succeed
in our cause.

84
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,840
Let's go,
uncle.

85
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,710
Let's go.

86
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,700
General Kichak got slain...

87
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,690
Whoever committed this heinous
act will certainly be punished.

88
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
King Virat

89
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,760
go and apprehend
the Pandavas then.

90
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,630
General Kichak was slain

91
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,690
by the Pandavas.

92
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,670
The Pandavas are not present
in the city of Virat.

93
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,790
They are not present
in the kingdom of Matsya either.

94
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,600
By uttering such rubbish

95
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,600
do not attempt to spread
fear in the city, Crown Prince.

96
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,800
King Virat

97
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,830
General Kichak

98
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,570
was on to the Pandavas.

99
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,600
The coming morning at dawn

100
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,770
all the immigrants and guests

101
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,600
were to produce themselves
in the court on Kichak's orders!

102
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,830
His murder proves

103
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,790
that the offenders of Hastinapur

104
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,740
are present in your kingdom.

105
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,600
King Virat

106
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,540
we merely wish to look
for our offenders

107
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,530
in your kingdom

108
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,760
and we seek
your permission for it.

109
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,800
Impossible!

110
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,730
I have made
no such promise to you.

111
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,660
The one who made it
has been killed.

112
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,530
His promise has died
along with him.

113
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,530
In other words,
you are

114
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,700
taking the side of the Pandavas

115
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Your Highness.

116
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,660
However, you seem
to be forgetting

117
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,500
that a man who builds an abode
next to the cremation grounds

118
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,530
has his food

119
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,500
tainted with the ash

120
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,570
of the deceased.

121
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,560
Since you have taken
the side of the Pandavas

122
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,700
you must also face

123
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,690
the consequences.

124
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,500
What you are implying,
King of Gandhar

125
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,620
is beyond my comprehension.

126
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,660
However, before I
lose my composure

127
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,570
all of you must
leave this place.

128
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,630
Soldiers

129
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
escort these three
to the borders of the city!

130
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
King Virat

131
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,470
each brick of your castle
will crumble.

132
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,630
Each subject of your kingdom

133
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,600
will die a gruesome death.

134
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,630
I shall slay

135
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,630
all your children
right before your eyes!

136
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,470
Tell the Pandavas

137
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,700
that if they have the competence

138
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,690
then they ought to be
prepared to protect you.

139
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,530
Very soon,
the army of Hastinapur

140
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,530
will attack the city of Virat.

141
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,700
It will attack
the city of Virat!

142
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,370
Hear all!

143
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,430
King Virat is on his way!

144
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,470
Your Highness

145
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,530
the inner part of the shell
that encloses a pearl safely

146
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,400
is way more brilliant
than the pearl itself.

147
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,590
Similarly,
your psyche

148
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,370
is illuminated with
the light of righteousness.

149
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,330
I have been humbled today

150
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,400
to have met a more
righteous man than me.

151
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Emperor Yudhishthir

152
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,430
the moment you had come
to the city of Virat

153
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,500
I had decided to keep you hidden
and offer you protection.

154
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,490
However,
I am of the opinion

155
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,460
that it would be better if you
leave the city of Virat now.

156
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,330
Duryodhan must be awaiting you
with his army outside the city

157
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,500
and Hastsinapur is going to
attack us very soon.

158
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,390
This battle is being
orchestrated

159
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
to render our life of anonymity
futile, Your Highness.

160
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,560
If we produce ourselves to them

161
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,300
then there will be no battle.

162
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Impossible!

163
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,460
If I cannot keep my promise then
it would also imply my defeat.

164
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,430
Emperor Yudhishthir,
all of you

165
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
must head West
using the secret passages.

166
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,500
I shall hold them off until you
complete your life of anonymity.

167
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
No,
King Virat.

168
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,470
We cannot forsake
our duties either.

169
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,430
Now, this battle
is not just yours

170
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,530
but ours as well.

171
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,430
We shall stay right here
and engage in this battle.

172
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,300
If we must produce
ourselves to them

173
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
then we shall accept it
as our fate.

174
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
If we must produce
ourselves to them

175
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,810
then we shall accept it
as our fate.

176
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,780
Brother Yudhishthir,
I am of the opinion

177
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,780
that when the Kuru army
stands outside the city of Virat

178
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,910
it will be the last day
of our life of anonymity.

179
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,780
We shall fight them
in our disguise.

180
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,010
If Duryodhan cannot
recognize us in twelve hours

181
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
then victory shall be ours!

182
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,910
Impossible!

183
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,010
This battle cannot take place.

184
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,010
In the Matsya kingdom,
the Crown Prince of Hastinapur

185
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,010
was gravely insulted,
grandsire!

186
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,750
So,
how can you say

187
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,970
that a battle cannot take place?

188
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Without being invoked first

189
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,940
no God ever takes part
in a 'yajna,' dear.

190
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,840
Without informing first

191
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
no King or Crown Prince

192
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,840
can ever enter another kingdom.

193
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,840
Why did you travel to the
kingdom of Matsya, Crown Prince?

194
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,970
The General of the city of Virat

195
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,720
Kichak had invited us,
Minister.

196
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,780
The King of Virat had no right

197
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,680
to insult us so!

198
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,910
If that is the case

199
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,870
then King Virat must come
to Hastinapur and apologize.

200
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,910
If he does not do so

201
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,940
then we shall
fight him in a battle.

202
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,770
This is tradition.

203
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,750
You wish to while away time

204
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,680
in some way or the other,
Your Excellency Bhishma.

205
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,780
What about you,
Crown Prince?

206
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,910
You are trying to launch
an attack at the earliest.

207
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,710
Your Highness

208
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,650
there can be dire consequences
to this battle.

209
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,910
Forming an alliance
with the Pandavas

210
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,640
will be next to
impossible for us

211
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
if we do so.

212
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,910
Do the Pandavas

213
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,870
scare you,
Minister?

214
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,650
Or do you have

215
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,880
a soft corner for them
in your heart?

216
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,840
What kind of a Minister

217
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,650
advices one to forget how
one's kingdom was insulted?!

218
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,850
This is not only my insult

219
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,740
but also that of all of you!

220
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,800
This society

221
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,840
gives respect
only to those people

222
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
who can safeguard
their respect, father!

223
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,840
People in the future will say

224
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,650
that Hastinapur had been
rendered powerless

225
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,740
when Emperor Pandu

226
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,740
had stepped down as the King

227
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,610
and had made his blind brother

228
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,740
the new King.

229
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,580
Be quiet,
Duryodhan!

230
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,640
You have said enough.

231
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,780
People of the court

232
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,840
Duryodhan is correct.

233
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,780
A battle will indeed take place

234
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,550
Your Excellency.
