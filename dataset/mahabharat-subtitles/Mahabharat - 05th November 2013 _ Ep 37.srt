1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,040
Sire.

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,000
How... How did you
achieve this, sire?

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
Did this question
arise out of amazement

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,930
or from the desire
to learn the art?

5
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,870
Can I also perform
such a wondrous deed?

6
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,960
Your grandsire
will answer that question.

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,960
Show this ball

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,000
to him with the stick I made
using blades of grass.

9
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,000
Attention!

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,730
King Dhritarashtra
is making his entrance!

11
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,860
Your Highness

12
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,930
there are seven vital topics
to be discussed in the court.

13
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,990
In the northern region,
there is severe water shortage

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,730
and in the south...
- The most vital topic

15
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,770
is the punishment
given to the princes.

16
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,800
Excluding the revered teacher
Kripacharya

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,730
all the other court members
need to vacate the court.

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,690
Your Highness

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,670
seeing their impudence, I felt

20
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,840
that it was necessary
to punish them.

21
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,670
Indeed, grandsire.

22
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,670
The question does not pertain
to your decision.

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,930
The question is as to
what was the reason

24
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,770
that led to friction between
Pandu's sons and mine.

25
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,930
In what manner
do Pandu's sons behave

26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,690
that Duryodhan's anger
knows no bounds?

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Your Highness!

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,830
Character is truly tested

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,700
when one has relationships
with unfamiliar people.

30
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,900
Until now, Kunti
and Queen Gandhari's sons

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,870
were unfamiliar with one another

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,830
but now that they are living
under the same roof

33
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,840
then how one acts

34
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,730
is reflective
of one's character.

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,890
In other words,
only my sons are flawed here!

36
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,860
Is this what you mean,
grandsire?

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
Dhritarashtra!

38
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,830
Your Highness...

39
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,630
Love for family is apt only when
it acts as an armour.

40
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,770
If that love becomes a weapon
then problems may arise.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,600
Your Highness, perhaps

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,670
the familial love has made
the princes impudent.

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,860
The scriptures and traditions
instruct us, Your Highness

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,670
that princes should gain wisdom
by residing in seminaries.

45
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,570
The capability
of testing my sons

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,670
lies with which 'Brahmin',
Vidur?

47
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,570
There should be
a capable 'Brahmin'

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,830
or a knower of
scriptures and weaponry

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,670
who can leave the court of Kuru
in awe with his capabilities.

50
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,790
Arjun.

51
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,830
Why did you enter the court
without permission?

52
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,760
Pardon me, sire.

53
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,740
I wished to show this
to grandsire.

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Brother Bhim.

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,660
Where are brother Yudhishthir,
Arjun and our other brothers?

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,630
Brother Yudhishthir
is practising 'yoga'.

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,770
Nakul and Sahadev
have gone with him.

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,670
Arjun has gone
to the royal court.

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,570
You need just me

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,570
if you wish to duel.

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,530
No, no. We have not come here
to engage in a duel.

62
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,600
We have brought some fruits
for the five of you.

63
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,470
There is a beautiful place
just a few yards from here.

64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,530
It is called Praman Koti.*
*Pramanakoti was a beautiful spot on the banks of Ganges, north of Hastinapura.

65
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,660
The fruits that grow
in the jungle there

66
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,570
are extremely sweet.

67
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,470
We have brought some for you.

68
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,530
Delicious.

69
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,570
Did I not tell you,
brother Bhim?

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,660
Let us go.
Today we have organised

71
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,530
a feast for all of you
in Praman Koti.

72
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,530
For us?
- Yes.

73
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,630
We did not welcome you
the right way.

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,430
That was our mistake,
brother Bhim.

75
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,460
You all are our brothers.

76
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,540
To give you respect and love
is our duty.

77
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,570
It took you quite some time
to learn this, Duryodhan.

78
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,660
One learns only with time,
brother Bhim.

79
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,500
It would be better if we make up
for our past mistakes.

80
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,560
Today, we 105 brothers
will jubilate in Praman Koti.

81
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,560
Indeed. Let me go call
brother Yudhishthir and Arjun.

82
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,460
Brother Bhim,
Dushashan will go and call them.

83
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,490
Dushashan, when Arjun
returns from the royal court

84
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,600
and when brothers Yudhishthir,
Nakul and Sahadev

85
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,470
are done with the yoga

86
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,430
bring them to Praman Koti
with you.

87
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,520
Shall we go, brother Bhim?

88
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,500
If you are fearful
of going alone with me...

89
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,600
Even then, no matter.

90
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,530
We shall leave after some time.

91
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,630
Fear?
Of what?

92
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,400
Let us go.

93
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,460
Let us go.
This way.

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Attention!

95
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,340
The great son of Ganga, Bhishma

96
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,490
is making his entrance!

97
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,530
The eminent son
of the great sage Bharadwaj!*
*The author of Ayurveda.

98
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
The great Bhishma.

99
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,400
Greetings.

100
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
Greetings, Dronacharya.*
*Acharya: Brahmin head guide or a highly learned man.

101
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,400
What crime
has Hastinapur committed

102
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,460
that without even receiving
a proper and apt welcome

103
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,430
you are leaving the palace?

104
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,400
If a proper and apt welcome
gave solace to the heart

105
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,530
then I would have resided in
the woods practicing the Vedas

106
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,530
great Bhishma.

107
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,440
In order to satiate a desert,
a few clouds are not enough.

108
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,500
Only a few rivers
can achieve this task.

109
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,370
Great Drona

110
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,440
your heart has burnt
with the fire of this enmity

111
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,330
and become arid like a desert.

112
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
And I know this.

113
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,300
Maybe this is the reason
why the news of your arrival

114
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,460
was not conveyed to me
by Kripacharya.

115
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,270
A true Brahmin is one
whose heart never dries up

116
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,330
and who does not let enmity
become the mantra of his life.

117
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,200
The courage and ability to argue
with one's wife's brother

118
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
is not something Lord Parashuram
blessed me with.

119
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,390
That is why I accept
what Kripacharya said.

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,460
I may not be a true Brahmin

121
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,460
but am certainly
a great warrior.

122
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,470
I'm a knower of
scriptures and weaponry

123
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,360
and a great teacher too.

124
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,400
And Hastinapur was awaiting
such a teacher.

125
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,460
This way, Drona.

126
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,200
Greetings.

127
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,230
May you live long.

128
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,660
Take this and feed it
to the son of Pandu.

129
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,630
With this approach

130
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,690
the five thorns
in the path of Duryodhan

131
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,620
will be gotten rid of
one by one.

132
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,750
When it comes
to gaining something

133
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,660
deception is more potent
than strength, Kark.

134
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,630
When it comes
to the struggles of life

135
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,720
and when man does not
deem himself adequate

136
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,620
and loses faith
in his own strength

137
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,660
then he renounces virtues
and embraces vices.

138
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,600
In reality, villainy is
born in man's life only

139
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,790
when his psyche
loses self-confidence.

140
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Only self-confidence
can bear righteousness.

141
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,730
What is self-confidence?

142
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,630
When man considers
that the struggles of life

143
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,820
make him weak

144
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,790
then he loses faith in himself.

145
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,750
Instead of braving the struggle

146
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,820
he looks for ways
to free himself of it.

147
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,790
But when he believes that
struggles will make him stronger

148
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,760
in a way a body
is strengthened with exercise

149
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,790
then with each struggle,
his enthusiasm magnifies.

150
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,660
In other words,
self-confidence is nothing but

151
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,690
a state of mind.

152
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,630
It is merely a way
of looking at life.

153
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,660
And the way of looking at life
is in the hands of man.

154
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
Give it a thought.

155
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,700
This is Praman Koti,
brother Bhim.

156
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,760
Many snakes and serpents
reside in this river.

157
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,600
They are extremely venomous.

158
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,620
But they bear no enmity
with the people of Kuru.

159
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,560
Are you listening,
brother Bhim?

160
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,530
Indeed. Did you not
say something about a feast?

161
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,490
I did.
- Yes.

162
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,550
Let us proceed.
Please come this way.

163
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,550
Do come, brother Bhim.
This way.

164
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,500
Look at all this.
Such varied dishes.

165
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,460
Our chefs
have prepared all this.

166
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,460
Especially for you.

167
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,620
When the rest of the brothers
are here, we shall begin eating.

168
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,600
That is alright but
brothers Yudhishthir, Arjun

169
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,560
Nakul, Sahadev and the rest
are not here yet.

170
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,600
Dushashan must be
on his way here with them.

171
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,450
And it would be inappropriate
to begin without them.

172
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,690
No, no.
We shall wait.

173
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,450
Brother Bhim, how about
we taste a little of everything?

174
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,460
That way we will know if we
need to alter the taste or not.

175
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,500
Indeed.
That is a good suggestion.

176
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,560
But we must not eat a lot.
- No, no!

177
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,430
We shall only taste these.

178
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,430
And you have a special interest
in food.

179
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,430
Indeed.
I am a great cook myself.

180
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,400
Then, brother, only you
should taste the dishes.

181
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,430
I too shall taste but I shall
not be able to comprehend much.

182
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,630
No, no.

183
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,430
Pay respect to food, Duryodhan.

184
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,560
First, you must get a whiff.

185
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,620
Then you must take in the aroma.

186
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,550
Wow!

187
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,430
Let herbs, saffron, fruits

188
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,560
and flower's aromas

189
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,430
satiate your heart.

190
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,560
This is food and not a battle.

191
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,420
One must not attack it.

192
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,350
Take a look.

193
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,340
Do taste this 'kheer,'*
brother Bhim.
*Rice pudding.

194
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,270
Our chefs make
the tastiest of 'kheer'.

195
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
No, no.

196
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,200
Then what will the rest
of the brothers eat?

197
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,310
If you insist so much

198
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,170
then I shall taste it a bit.

199
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,370
Pardon me, 'laddoos'.

200
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,310
I shall eat you after a while.

201
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,270
Duryodhan.

202
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,310
You are younger to me.

203
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,270
You should taste it first.

204
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,270
Me?

205
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,110
No, brother Bhim.
You are elder to me.

206
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,170
You should taste it first.

207
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,270
Have some.

208
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,110
No, I cannot eat this.

209
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,170
Why not?

210
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,160
What is wrong with this 'kheer'?

211
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,080
Nothing.
I was just ribbing you.

212
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,240
Give that to me.

213
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,240
It is delicious.
