1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,320
I will certainly emerge
victorious in this battle.

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,720
I will become the emperor
of all the kingdoms.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,120
After me, my son Laxman...*
*"Auspicious."

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,080
After him, his son
will become the emperor.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,480
If the last survivor
of the Pandavas' lineage

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,320
is being nurtured
in anyone's womb

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,200
he will be killed,
before he is even born.

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,960
Listen carefully, mother.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,480
I will die and the five Pandavas
will survive...

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,560
Don't you even think
of such a scenario.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,120
Until I receive the news
of the death

12
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,840
of those five brothers

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,240
my soul will not leave my body.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,760
It won't.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,320
I take that vow!

16
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,960
The King of Panchal Dhrupad,
Commander Shikhandini

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,520
and Prince Dhrishtadyumna
are entering!

18
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
Stay blessed.

19
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
Stay blessed.

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,520
Father

21
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,240
where are my sons?

22
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,440
Can a child stay away
from his mother's love?

23
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,720
Mother, my life revolves
around the inspiration

24
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
of my father Yudhisthir's
righteousness.

25
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,240
Bless me
that in the coming battle

26
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,880
I am able to live up
to everyone's expectations.

27
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Prativindhya
*Prativindya means Drupadi's son. Other name: Shrutavindha "related to the Buddhi (righteousness)."

28
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,440
may you have a very long life.

29
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Greetings, mother.

30
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,760
I am the heir to my father
Bheem's strength.

31
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,840
Bless me, mother

32
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,280
so that I am able to crush
the heads of my enemies.

33
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,040
So be it, Sutasom.*
"Manifestation of the mind", because he was born after Bhima had performed a thousand Soma** sacrifices.)**A Vedic ritual drink, juice extract of Ephedra sinica stalk.

34
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Mother, bless me so that I can
make my father Arjun's powers

35
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,720
my achievements.

36
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Every arrow you shoot

37
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,600
will be reinforced with my blessings, Sutakarma.*
*Action taken by his son.

38
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,360
May you have a very long life.

39
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,120
Mother, bless me so
that I become as effective

40
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,880
as the sharp sword
of my father Nakul

41
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,280
against our enemies.

42
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,280
Satanika*
*Named after a famous king in the Kuru lineage who had that name and he was considered to be an avatar of Visvadevas (various Vedic gods).

43
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,600
all your ambitions
will be fulfilled.

44
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,480
You have my blessings.

45
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,360
Mother, bless me

46
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
so that like my father Sahadev

47
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,400
even my insight always
helps our side.

48
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,000
Srutasena,* it will certainly be so.
*With a famous army.

49
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,840
You will always
have my blessings.

50
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,520
Mother

51
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,000
we will face every attack
meant for our fathers.

52
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,960
You are my sons.

53
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,720
You are impossible to defeat
on the battlefield.

54
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,920
And I will act
as my brothers' shield.

55
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,720
Give me such a blessing.

56
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,280
May you be immortal,
Abhimanyu.

57
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
Go.

58
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,120
Take blessings from
your fathers.

59
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,680
Your Majesty

60
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
Uttara is fortunate

61
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,200
that she is getting married
to Prince Abhimanyu.

62
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,000
When Uttara's son

63
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,800
will rule Indraprastha
sitting on the royal throne

64
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,840
he will be protected
by five uncles.

65
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,080
Abhimanyu's son?

66
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,760
The greatest of the Yadavs,
Krishna, has promised me

67
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,920
that Uttara will give birth

68
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,960
to the emperor who will
rule over the entire nation.

69
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,960
Abhimanyu will be the reason
behind the change of an epoch

70
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
and his son

71
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,720
will take the first step
towards that change.

72
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Govind.

73
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,480
Govind

74
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,480
what is going to happen
in the battle

75
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,480
between the Kauravas
and the Pandavas?

76
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,960
I need to know.

77
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,080
Why such a question suddenly,
my friend?

78
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,160
In this battle, Bheem and Arjun
shall fulfil their oaths.

79
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,880
Sinners shall be punished.

80
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,720
Righteousness shall win.

81
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Who all will die, Govind?

82
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
Who all will survive?

83
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,220
Who can know the result
of a battle?

84
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,860
You can.

85
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,660
Tell me.

86
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,460
Why did the sacred thread
tied by me, break?

87
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,300
You said that Abhimanyu shall
be the reason behind the change

88
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,820
but his son will take the first
step towards that change.

89
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,380
You said that Abhimanyu's son
shall be the ruler of the nation

90
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,660
But my elder son Prativindhya
has the foremost right

91
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,460
to the throne of Hastinapur.

92
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,460
Why will his son
not become the emperor?

93
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,380
Why will Abhimanyu
not become the emperor himself?

94
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,300
There is some deep meaning
in your words, Govind.

95
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,940
But I want a clear answer.

96
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,380
The sorrow of the future destroys
the joys of the present.

97
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,100
The joys of the future

98
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,660
cannot erase
the grief of the future.

99
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,340
Don't try to know the future.

100
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,940
It won't help you
in any manner.

101
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,980
Learn to live in the present.

102
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,900
Perform your duties.

103
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,660
And don't try to find out the
Almighty's plans for the future.

104
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,220
That means...

105
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,940
Will Abhimanyu

106
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,340
die?

107
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,940
And my five sons...

108
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,740
Govind!

109
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,980
Will they also...

110
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,620
Will they die as well?
