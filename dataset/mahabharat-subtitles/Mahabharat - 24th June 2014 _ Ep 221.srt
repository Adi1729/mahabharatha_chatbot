1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,210
Whoever raises his weapon
againts Hastinaour

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,110
shall have to pay the price for it!

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,190
You are right, Grandsire!

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,130
It isn't your skills that are
being displayed in this battle

5
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,110
but it is your weakness that is exposed.

6
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,210
If you were capable indeed

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,150
instead of taking the lives
of your heirs and descendants

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,020
you would lay down your own life!

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,100
I...

10
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,170
am bound by my duty, Khrisna!

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,130
Duties grant liberation!

12
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,130
What duty is this that blinds you instead?

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,170
Surely this isn't your duty

14
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,980
but a snare!

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,010
A shackle!

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,990
Do not question my sense of duty, Khrisna!

17
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,030
In my entire life never for a moment
have I commited injustice!

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,230
In order to fulfill the promise I made to
my father I only did what was necessary!

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,010
Just for the sake of your duty
you are plunging the whole world into peril!

20
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,980
I do not consider this
the strength of character.

21
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,050
A character is which strives towards
everyone's well being, every moment.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Your character is tainted
and so is your duty!

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,070
Khrisna!

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,110
You are crossing your limit!

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,050
I respect you very much!

26
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,250
But you have no rights
to call one's duties tainted!

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,180
My duty is truth!

28
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,090
And therefore, no one can defeat me!

29
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,960
- No one!
- I can defeat you!

30
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,010
I can defeat you this very moment,
Grandsire Bheeshma!

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,170
Do not fan the flames of my anger!

32
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,050
There is no such metal
that does not meal in my fire!

33
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,990
And there is no oath, no curse or no blessing

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,130
that I cannot violate!

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,190
You are being a hindrance to worldly
well being and the course of destiny.

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,170
If you do not lay down
your weapons now

37
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,120
I shall surely slay you!

38
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,080
[MUSIC]

39
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,070
I do not even need a weapon to slay you!

40
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,020
I can slay you even
with the wheel of this chariot!

41
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,190
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

42
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,220
Khrisna!

43
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,180
Why aren't my arrows able to reach you, Khrisna?

44
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,230
I am not Vasudeva Khrisna!

45
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,130
I am not a Yadava!

46
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,040
I am not even human!

47
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,200
I am the most supreme God, Grandsire!

48
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,980
I am truth, knowledge and justice!

49
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,240
You are fighting only with my permission!

50
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,110
You are alive only with my consent.

51
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,090
And it is with my consent
that you may acquire death!

52
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,250
Please forgive me, Khrisna!

53
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,150
I was unaware of your true form.

54
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,220
You are indeed capable of slaying me.

55
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:33,070
But in order to slay me,
you are willing to violate you oath.

56
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,280
I must indeed be largely at fault!

57
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,020
What is my fault, Khrisna?
Please tell me!

58
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,020
Your fault is ignorance, Grandsire!

59
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,130
You never tried to comprehend
the true form of justice!

60
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,200
Until the roof of compassion
spans the entire world

61
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,010
until then justice in society
stays incomplete.

62
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,980
But you only thought about your family.

63
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,990
You never thought about worldly well being!

64
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,060
Therefore even your sacrifice
is a form of selfishness.

65
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,000
I renounced royalty for the sake of my father!

66
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,210
I swore to a lifetime of celibacy.

67
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,210
There were no selfish motives for these, Khrisna!

68
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,010
The oath to celibacy and renouncement
of royalty were indeed great deeds!

69
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,250
But why did you give up your responsibility
towards the society, Grandsire?

70
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,000
In order to avoid mutual conflict
within the Kuru clan

71
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,260
and to avoid war in Hastinapur for the throne

72
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,200
and to protect the subjects of
Kuru dynasty from pain.

73
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,060
I took up this oath, Khrisna.

74
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,110
Look all around you, Grandsire?

75
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,010
What is going on here?

76
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,080
Your oath did not avoid
this catastrophe, this war!

77
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,090
Ponder over it, Grandsire!

78
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,060
You treated your oath as your duty!

79
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,160
If it indeed were just

80
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,030
why would this great war occur?

81
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,040
In reality, justice isn't a name
of a forgotten thought.

82
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,240
It isn't the name of any tradition either.

83
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,170
Justice is the name of life!

84
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,180
And life changes constantly!

85
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,160
Changes is the characteristic of life!

86
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,000
And a human must commit deeds
for the sake of change!

87
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,970
Yet you give up on deeds, Grandsire?

88
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,160
But I have acted only appropriately
at every step of life, Khrisna.

89
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,200
No, Grandsire!

90
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,140
In this birth of yours

91
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,140
in order to keep yourself from the ties of actions

92
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,050
you have not truly engaged
in any significant action.

93
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,120
The meaning of actions is taking decisions
and accepting the consequences of one's actions.

94
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,230
But when did you take any decision,
Your Excellency?

95
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,030
Was crowning King Pandu your decision?

96
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,240
'A person who is blind since birth'

97
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,140
'is unworthy of becoming the King.'

98
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,010
'That is why I suggest'

99
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,080
'brother Pandu to be crowned the King.'

100
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,220
Was having King Dhirtarashtra
and Queen Gandahari married your decision?

101
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,250
'On the auspicious occasion of Akshay Tritiya'*
*Hindu holy day, believed to bring good luck and success.

102
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,190
'Prince Dhritarashtra shall be married
to Gandahari the Princess of Gandhar.'

103
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,130
Why did you not try to stop King Dhritarashtra
from committing unrighteous deed, Your Excellency?

104
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,110
'Prince Duryodhan was attacked by these people
and you need to punish them.'

105
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,070
'That is atrocious.'

106
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,170
'Just do as I say!'

107
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
The decision of hosting the game of dice

108
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,990
and that of not stopping the
humalliation of Panchali there...

109
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,190
'Grandsire, the whole of the Aryan
region resonates of your glory.'

110
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,120
'You are the son of Goddess Ganga Herself.'

111
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,230
'Then despite witnessing such depravity.'
'How can you even remain quite?!'

112
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,200
The decision of waging this war...

113
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,110
'To establish righteousness
in the Aryan region again'

114
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,270
'it is mandatory to wage a war.'

115
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,210
In order to stop all these unrighteous deeds not
only did you have the competence but also power.

116
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,080
But you could not take a decision,
Your Excellency.

117
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,190
You remained bound to your oath and vow!

118
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,250
'I...'

119
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,160
'shall live my life as a servant!'

120
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,230
The truth is that under the garb of duties

121
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,110
you kept running away
from the responsibilty of taking decisions!

122
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,080
Does taking decisions not forge new ties, Vasudev?

123
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,250
In order to free yourself from various tie and you
tried to understand the principle of selfness acts

124
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,020
then your life would have been filled
with righousness, Your Excellency.

125
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,070
In order to free yourself from ties,
why did you renouce actions altogether?

126
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,970
You could have renounced
the fruits of those actions.

127
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Instead of deeming someone's order to be a duty
you could have deemed your action to be so.

128
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,210
That would have rid you of your ties as well.

129
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,990
You had taken that oath a very long time ago.

130
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,060
Did you know what the future
had in store back then?

131
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,190
Circumstances changed, Your Excellency.

132
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,100
Times changed.

133
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,000
But did you not break your oath.

134
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,160
And neither did you accept any change.

135
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,240
As a result of all that
this war is being waged today.

136
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,990
Then does an oath hold no value?

137
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,090
It indeed does.

138
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,030
An oath that benefits the
entire society indeed holds value.

139
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,260
However, the moment

140
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,000
the oath of a person and his decision

141
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,040
begins to affect the society adversely

142
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,140
then that very instant

143
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,040
it becomes mandatory
to break that oath, Your Excellency.

144
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,260
If fighting from the side of Pandavas
is the decision you cannot take today.

145
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,260
Then at least give up your weapons.

146
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,970
And accept your death.

147
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,200
Today being on the side of the Pandavas

148
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,020
if you cannot take the decision
to engage in battle

149
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,210
at least lay down your weapons

150
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,990
and accept your death!

151
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,060
I accept, Khrisna!

152
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:15,230
If I had acquired the knowledge
imparted by you earlier

153
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,230
a lot of injustice could be avoided.

154
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
But...

155
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,110
even if not in life

156
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,980
at least in death the knowledge
imparted by you will surely be useful.

157
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,990
Death at your hands shall be
a great honour to me.

158
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,070
End me!
I am ready!

159
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,210
As you wish, Grandsire!

160
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,240
No, Khrisna!

161
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,330
You have sworn not to engage in battle!

162
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,240
It is the time to break my oath now, Arjun!

163
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,080
That is why I am breaking my oath!

164
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,150
But, Khrisna, the entire world
shall condemn you then!

165
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,350
Then I shall accept it!

166
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,290
Either way, after this battle
I have to bear may insults

167
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,160
and curse and you are not aware of it.

168
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,260
But I would not feel glad or sad about it!

169
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,340
At this moment, Grandsire's death in inevitable!

170
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,210
No, Khrisna!

171
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,320
Give me an opportunity!
I shall give up all my affection

172
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,290
and defeat Grandsire under 
my circumstances!

173
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,210
But Khrisna do not commit
such a grave sin due to me.

174
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,140
If it happens so because of me

175
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,050
that very moment

176
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,180
I shall die, Khrisna!

177
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,090
Give me an opportunity!
Please heed to my plea!

178
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,080
My death

179
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,180
is pre-ordained at the hands
of Princess Amba of Kashi.

180
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,080
And ought to that reason

181
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,190
Princess Amba is born as Shikhandini!

182
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,190
Let only her have the privilege
of slaying me, Khrisna!

183
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,290
I promise!

184
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,130
I promise, Khrisna.
I shall wait for her!

185
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,050
And the day when she faces me

186
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,080
on the battlefield

187
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,120
I shall lay down all my weapons!

188
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,060
Until then

189
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,130
I shall surely protect the soldiers of Hastinapur!

190
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,110
But none of your soldiers
shall die at my hands!

191
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,300
This is neither my duty

192
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,180
nor anyone's orders!

193
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,340
This is my decision, Khrisna!
