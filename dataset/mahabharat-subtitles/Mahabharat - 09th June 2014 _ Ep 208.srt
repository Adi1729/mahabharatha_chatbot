1
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,480
Prince Duryodhana
is standing there!

2
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,100
Remember, Arjun!

3
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,480
The orders to drag Draupadi into
a filled royal court as a slave

4
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,380
were issued by him!

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,540
'Dushyasan, bring that
slave Draupadi to this court!'

6
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,040
'If that arrogant woman
dares defy my orders'

7
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,610
'grab her by the hair
and drag her till here!'

8
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,380
Look here, Arjun!

9
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,940
This is your uncle, Shakuni!

10
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,870
Today he wields a sword!

11
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,110
But he always tries
to attack by treachery!

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Remember

13
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,340
how he conspired to burn all you
five brothers and your mother

14
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,040
in Varanavrath!

15
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,080
'In the palace of Varanavrath
all five of our foes'

16
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,980
'shall be together!'

17
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,910
'In that very palace'

18
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,480
'your ascension to princehood
shall be decided!'

19
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,980
Now look here, Arjun!
Dushyasan!

20
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,470
These very hands had committed
the audacity

21
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,410
to infringe
upon Panchali's modesty!

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,140
Look at Grandsire Bhishma
and Master Drona!

23
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,480
He stayed a mute spectator
as Draupadi was dishonoured!

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,510
Look at Ashwatthama over there!

25
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,110
And remember the foul words
he had used!

26
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,870
'The one who nurses
a relationship'

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
'with five men...'

28
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,380
'l am ashamed to call her
my sister!'

29
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,240
Does your head not crave

30
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,010
for vengeance now, Arjun?

31
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,110
Does your soul not
clamour for justice now?

32
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,770
Does the desire to wield
a weapon does not arise in you?

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,810
Does the battle
not seem inevitable now?

34
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,300
Yes, Krishna!

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
This battle is inevitable!

36
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,810
Now, this battle seems
inevitable to you!

37
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,370
So, look at your Grandsire
once again, Arjun?

38
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,140
And remember

39
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,370
how he provided you with love
and protection at each step!

40
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,840
He sacrificed himself

41
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,970
in an attempt to get justice
for you and your family!

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,810
'As long as you hold the throne
of Hastinapur as a king'

43
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,850
'l shall live every moment
to protect you!'

44
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,640
'But today, please grant
the sons of Pandu'

45
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,340
'one chance at solace, son!'

46
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,810
Once again look at Master Drona

47
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,910
and remember how with
immense love and pride

48
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,700
he bestowed upon you
his supreme knowledge!

49
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,940
'You shall be the world's
best archer!'

50
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,410
'l shall make you
the world's best archer!'

51
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,200
'This is my promise, son!'

52
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,740
Just in order to make you
the world's best archer

53
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,800
he burdened himself with sin!

54
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,070
Remember, Arjun!

55
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,780
'If you wish to give me
a souvenir as a disciple'

56
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,640
'grant me the thumb
of your right hand!'

57
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,140
And over there,
look at Vikarna as well.

58
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,340
He was the only one

59
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,710
who dared to oppose
at the royal court that day!

60
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,540
'If a King ever loses in battle,
he has to lay down his arms!'

61
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,110
'But a lady should not be
dishonoured in this manner!'

62
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,940
'There is a difference between'

63
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,810
'disarming an enemy and
dishonouring a woman, brother!'

64
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,970
'And Draupadi is the bride
of the Kuru dynasty!'

65
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,300
'This is the truth!'

66
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,310
ls all this worth killing for,
Arjun?

67
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,880
No, Krishna!

68
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,580
How can I kill them?

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Indeed!

70
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,140
But look at the side you are on,
Arjun!

71
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,540
Now look at the side you are on,
Arjun!

72
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,840
Your eldest brother, Yudishtir!

73
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,900
Brother Bheem!

74
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,970
Look at your younger brothers!

75
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,410
Look at your sons
and your nephews!

76
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,210
Many of them shall meet
their demise in this battle!

77
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Doesn't your head feel weakened

78
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,510
by the possibility
of their death, Arjun!

79
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,780
Now also think over

80
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,940
as to what is the fault
of Brother Duryodhana!

81
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,710
If he was greedy for power

82
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,970
and if it is true
if he was conceived earlier...

83
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,740
If Dushyasan committed a crime
by dishonouring Draupadi...

84
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,140
If it is indeed a crime

85
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,800
even you heeded to your
elder brother

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,440
and let your wife
be dishonoured!

87
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,010
Wasn't that a crime too?

88
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,480
Grandsire considered his oath
to be more important

89
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,040
and assumed the honour of his
clan's bride as insignificant!

90
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,340
Was that not unfair?

91
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,740
And your eldest brother
Yudishtir

92
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,710
in order to fulfill
his personal obligation

93
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,010
participated in the gamble
in the court!

94
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,980
Was that not unfair?

95
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,010
So, is it appropriate to assume

96
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,570
brother Duryodhana as a foe?

97
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,070
Do you see justice
on your side, Arjun?

98
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,740
You are indeed right, Krishna!

99
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,340
On both sides
I can see justice

100
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,770
and injustice as well!

101
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,400
Therefore

102
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,910
you could never realize
the purpose of the war

103
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,340
nor could you perceive
the form of justice, Arjun!

104
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,790
My mind has gone numb, Krishna!

105
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,120
Every part of me is trembling!

106
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,190
My hands

107
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,660
do not have the strength
to wield a weapon!

108
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,290
My 'Gandiva' bow is repeatedly
slipping of my grasp, Krishna!

109
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
I can only foresee
immense destruction!

110
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,290
Only immense destruction!

111
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,360
Why?
What for, Krishna?

112
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,360
What for?

113
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,650
The agony of insult?

114
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,990
The thoughts of injustice

115
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,020
or the oath of vengeance?
I do not have any such reason.

116
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
I have no reason, Krishna

117
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,860
to accept such vast catastrophe!

118
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,050
I cannot!

119
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,300
A catastrophe is the foundation
of reformation, Arjun!

120
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,260
If a branch of a tree is cut off
two grow in its place!

121
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,490
Why do you fear
the catastrophe today?

122
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,530
Do you not know the fact that it
shall cause reformation later?

123
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,050
'Do not embrace this impotence,
O' Arjuna!'

124
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,860
'This does not befit you!'

125
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,550
This impotence does not
befit you at all!

126
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,060
It is your duty to wage a war,
Arjun!

127
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Raise your weapon!

128
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,560
How can I raise my weapon,
Krishna?

129
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,790
Serving these people

130
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,090
has been the most fortunate
aspect of life!

131
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,960
Such are my Grandsire,
Master Drona, uncle

132
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,090
and my elder brother!

133
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,890
I do not have the courage to
raise my weapons against them!

134
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,990
Even if I attain Heaven
by slaying them

135
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,690
it is futile, Krishna!

136
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,560
It is futile!

137
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,920
Krishna, a man lives
thinking of his future.

138
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,860
Even when I look
at these soldiers

139
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,050
when I look at these
million soldiers

140
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,960
it reminds me
that post the war

141
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,390
countless women
shall be widowed.

142
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,820
Countless children
shall be orphaned.

143
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,530
Tomorrow, when the rules
of society are broken

144
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,420
there shall be none to teach
the values of tradition!

145
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,090
The knowledge of 'Vedas'
shall go extinct, Krishna!

146
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,860
The Kuru dynasty
shall be destroyed!

147
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,520
The safety of the Arya clan
shall be destroyed!

148
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,930
It shall all be destroyed,
Krishna!

149
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,690
It shall all be destroyed!

150
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,990
You may preach like a wise man!

151
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,360
But in reality

152
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,620
you speak like a fool, Arjun!

153
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,460
What shall be destroyed?

154
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,860
If a tree sheds a few leaves
or grow new ones

155
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,830
it cannot be held as a reason
for joys or sorrows!

156
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,020
The reason for a leafs creation

157
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,850
and the meaning
of their existence

158
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,290
is just to keep the tree alive!

159
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,260
Similarly, the real reason
and purpose for a man's birth

160
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,630
is the society's well-being!

161
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,650
The society is for the world!

162
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,990
And the entire world
is for creation!

163
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,350
And this entire creation
is for God Himself, Arjun!

164
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,230
The one who realises this fact

165
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,490
can always see the path
to justice clearly!

166
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,630
Yes, Arjun!

167
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,220
There shall be destruction
in this war!

168
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,790
There shall indeed be!

169
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,940
Yes, Arjun!

170
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,050
There shall be destruction
in this war!

171
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,540
There shall indeed be!

172
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,150
But bear this in mind too

173
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,750
that new traditions
shall be formed too!

174
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,840
Old traditions have been
rendered poisonous!

175
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,270
Thousands of years ago

176
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,110
the heritage that was
established by the 'Vedas'

177
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,280
now remain as mere words!

178
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,850
The social construct that was
based on a man's intelligence

179
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,080
is now based on a man's birth

180
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,480
and has become a medium
for exploitation, Arjun!

181
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,320
Old constructs shall shatter!

182
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,050
New constructs shall arise!

183
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,180
Old heritage

184
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,180
shall rise again in a new form!

185
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,680
Just as before rainfall

186
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,010
even the cloud strewn skies
look stained

187
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,180
and the land sprawled with
flowers seems tainted as well

188
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,980
the situation is similar today.

189
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,440
And past the rainfall

190
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,750
the skies and the earth
are washed clean!

191
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,280
Similarly, post this war

192
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,480
the society and the world
shall be scourged clean, Arjun!

193
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,180
Post this war

194
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,050
the society and the world
shall be cleansed as well!

195
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,080
Hence give up
your affection, Arjun!

196
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,680
Think of the benefit
of the entire world!

197
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,020
Raise your weapon and wage war!

198
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,450
I can hear your words, Krishna!

199
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,380
But their meanings
do not reach my head!

200
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,710
My mind is clouded by affection!

201
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,750
How do I see through it
and view my duties!

202
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,020
My mind is filled with
thoughts of my dear ones!

203
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,620
How can I think of
the entire world?

204
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,280
Krishna, you had said

205
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,170
that you shall steer my chariot

206
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,350
in the appropriate direction!

207
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,550
Take command of my soul

208
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,320
steer the course of my life
in the right direction, Krishna!

209
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,650
What is it that
after knowing which

210
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,680
I can overcome my weakness?

211
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,950
Rise, Arjun!

212
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,820
Listen, Arjun!
Know the secret of life!

213
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,580
Comprehend the actual form
of creation!

214
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,710
Plunging your fist

215
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,010
into the current of river Ganga
won't give you anything!

216
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,280
But if you dip a cupped palm
into the current of river Ganga

217
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,050
the holy water of Ganga
can be raised to your lips!

218
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,950
Think, Arjun!

219
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,010
Is it a fist of arrogance

220
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,850
or a cupped palm of sacrifice
that you have assumed?

221
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,880
Can you comprehend
this knowledge?
