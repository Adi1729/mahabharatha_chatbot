1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,470
'Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra'

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,280
'will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.'

3
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,510
'As long as you bear your armour
and stand before me'

4
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,410
'it is impossible to kill me.'

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,550
'This armour of yours
makes you invincible, friend.'

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,470
'However,
it makes me immortal.'

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,450
'Your holy armour is'
'undoubtedly important to you.'

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,450
'However, it is'
'more important to me, friend.'

9
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,340
Greetings,
revered 'Brahmin'.

10
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,400
I am a requester.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,280
I have been travelling to seek
something, King of Anga

12
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,340
which is both death

13
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,210
and ambrosia.

14
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,340
It is both living
and also the cause of life.

15
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
It is both visible
and invisible.

16
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,310
It is gentle

17
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,370
yet tough.

18
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,210
It is a part of the body

19
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,180
but also a means.

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,280
It is both pure and impure.

21
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,220
My armour and ear-rings.

22
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,310
As they are a blessing,
they are pure.

23
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,150
However, as they are joined
to my body, they are impure.

24
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,250
They are both
visible and invisible.

25
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,220
As long as they are
joined to my body

26
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,280
they act as ambrosia.

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,270
However, when they will be
separated from my body

28
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,110
they will become
the cause of my death.

29
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,250
Have you not come here
to ask for these

30
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,180
Lord Indra?

31
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,180
Your father must indeed
have told you, dear.

32
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,170
Tomorrow at dawn

33
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,340
I am going to ask you
for your ear-rings and armour.

34
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,340
Does your son
have no competence

35
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,280
to retaliate against me?

36
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,040
Is he scared of
my armour and ear-rings?

37
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,340
Looking for ways to ensure
the protection of one's son

38
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,280
is the right of every father.

39
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,270
My son's fear has got
nothing to do with this!

40
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,270
However

41
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,270
the apprehensions within
the heart of a father

42
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,310
are certainly
associated with it.

43
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,110
Despite being a God, how can
you be so partial, Lord Indra?

44
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,170
The enmity between people is
limited solely to their deaths.

45
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,070
If the immortal Gods
begin to act partially

46
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
it would be a disgrace to them.

47
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,050
Even the waves of the ocean
compete with each other.

48
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,250
However, the ocean does not
act partially towards any wave.

49
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,070
Do you not have faith
in your competence?

50
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,170
Or without your armour

51
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,050
will you not be able
to confront Arjun?

52
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,000
Is that what you fear?

53
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,050
I do not fear for myself,
Lord Indra.

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,170
I have firm faith

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,110
that I shall indeed slay Arjun.

56
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,170
Then the entire world will know
who the true brave one is.

57
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,010
But the question here is
not solely about my bravery.

58
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,050
It is about the trust
of my friend.

59
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,940
I have taken an oath
to protect him

60
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,210
and help him gain victory.

61
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,110
By taking my armour away

62
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,970
you are being
unjust to my friend.

63
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,950
I request you...
- The decision is yours!

64
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,210
If you do not wish to engage
in charity then just say so.

65
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
And if you do not have
the courage to refuse me

66
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,020
then offering Surya Dev

67
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,170
water at dawn is a right
you will no longer have.

68
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,140
You need to decide which oath
is more important to you

69
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,140
out of the two oaths of yours.

70
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,950
I shall wait at the river-bank

71
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,110
at dawn with the intent

72
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,080
of seeking charity from you.

73
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,850
'Very soon, for the benefit
of his son, Lord Indra'

74
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,010
'will come to you to ask
for your ear-rings and armour.'

75
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,080
'These make you immortal and
denote your divinity as well.'

76
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,870
'Without them,
the weapons of Arjun'

77
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,920
'will be able
to pierce your body.'

78
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,940
'Tomorrow at dawn'

79
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,810
'I am going to ask you
for your ear-rings and armour.'

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,980
'Your competence does not lie
in your armour'

81
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,920
'but in your armour
lies my protection.'

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,920
'If the Pandavas'

83
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,780
'attack me with a weapon'

84
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,780
'then this holy armour of yours'

85
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,010
'will protect me like a fort,
friend Karna.'

86
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,010
'I shall wait at the river-bank'

87
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,940
'at dawn with the intent'

88
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,950
'of seeking charity from you.'

89
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,780
It is almost time for dawn,
Madhav

90
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,850
but Surya Dev refuses
to grace us with His presence.

91
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,840
Wars do not exist
solely in battlefields.

92
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,870
Sometimes

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,980
a war can take place
within the heart, friend.

94
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,980
And then, the darkness of
the heart cannot be dispelled.

95
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,910
Even the darkness of Surya Dev
himself cannot be dispelled.

96
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,940
But why would
the heart of Surya Dev

97
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,910
be troubled with a war,
Madhav?

98
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,940
Where there is attachment

99
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,750
there is struggle.

100
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,810
And where there is struggle,
there is

101
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,780
the hope of victory.

102
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,720
There is the hope of success.

103
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,850
However,
be it life or a war

104
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,940
success can be had

105
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,810
only with the aid
of three weapons.

106
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,750
Righteousness,
patience

107
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,810
and courage.

108
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,780
The rest of the weapons
are merely means.

109
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,680
You forgot one more weapon,
Vasudev.

110
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,770
And that weapon

111
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,880
is opportunity.

112
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,670
Without opportunity

113
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,750
righteousness remains latent

114
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,780
so does courage

115
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,780
and patience does not exist.

116
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,810
Bless you, Arjun,
son of Pandu.

117
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,650
Vasudev Krishna

118
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,700
do accept my greetings.

119
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,850
Greetings.

120
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,640
In order to establish
righteousness on the earth

121
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,620
the great initiative you have
taken in the form of this war

122
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,580
just fills my heart

123
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,770
with great respect for you.

124
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,550
The human beings who will
fight from your side in this war

125
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,770
will be exceedingly fortunate.

126
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,810
But an old 'Brahmin' like me

127
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,770
does not have the strength
to bear any weapon.

128
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,610
However,
I wish to contribute

129
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,580
something precious
to this great undertaking.

130
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,710
You are too kind,
revered 'Brahmin.'

131
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,540
However,
a war

132
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
demands the shedding of blood.

133
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,680
Splendid.

134
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,650
Then that is how I shall
contribute, Arjun, son of Kunti.

135
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,670
But is blood not shed
in a battlefield?

136
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,710
It is not shed before a war.

137
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,610
By acquiring knowledge

138
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,580
man creates opportunities
for himself

139
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,670
for his success in the future.

140
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,620
In order to be able
to shed blood in a war

141
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,740
it is better to create
opportunities today itself

142
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,750
Vasudev.

143
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,580
And this would be
my contribution.

144
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,670
An opportunity to shed blood.

145
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,840
Surya Dev

146
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,960
it is time for you to rise.

147
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,770
The entire creation awaits you.

148
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,030
Everyone is your child.

149
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,010
For the benefit
of one son of yours

150
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,840
do not keep the other children
of yours from your light.

151
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,830
Once, the son of Pavan Dev* had hidden you in His mouth.
*Pavana (the Purifier), other name of Vayu, the god of the winds.

152
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,770
The entire creation was on
the verge of destruction then.

153
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,730
I request you,
father.

154
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,770
Please show yourself

155
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,970
and accept my offering.

156
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,710
In the dilemmas of life,
please allow your son

157
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,970
to take his own decisions,
father.

158
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,740
At some point of time in life

159
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,860
every person is robbed of
the protection of his father

160
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,770
and that is when his competence
is truly put to the test

161
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,800
father.

162
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,740
Even a tree
lets go of its fruits

163
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,740
in order to aid the creation
generate new life.

164
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,770
Allow the world to test
my competence, father

165
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,670
so that no one is able to say

166
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,810
that I gained victory
with your help.

167
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,830
If that happens

168
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,700
then my entire life
will be tainted.

169
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,830
I too am a part
of your light, father.

170
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,670
Instead of living in
the darkness of a tainted life

171
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,800
it would be better
if I die a death of glory.

172
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,840
I request you,
father.

173
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,700
Please show yourself

174
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,870
and accept my offering.

175
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,410
I am prepared

176
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,190
to give your son an opportunity
to win, Lord Indra.

177
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,330
Emitting light to the world
does not lessen the sun's power.

178
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,260
The son of Lord Surya
is still competent enough.

179
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,460
Tell me.

180
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,420
What is it that you
wish to seek from me?

181
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,260
But what will that
revered 'Brahmin' give me

182
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,290
that will become
an opportunity for me?

183
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,230
Call it deceit, treachery
or opportunity

184
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,360
but all the attempts
to allay an agitated mind

185
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,390
hold no value.

186
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,320
Where there is righteousness,
patience and courage

187
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,420
there is success.

188
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,250
And one is bound to find success
with their aid, friend.

189
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,290
Without opportunity,
righteousness remains latent

190
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,230
courage is dormant
and patience is lost...

191
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,350
This is what he had said.

192
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,260
Righteousness
is nothing but a lie

193
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,350
if it requires opportunity.

194
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,190
Courage is incomplete

195
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,130
if it lies dormant
until opportunity beckons.

196
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,280
Patience is worthless

197
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,250
if it is lost
before achieving success.

198
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,250
Then why did you
accept his aid, Madhav?

199
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,180
What he said was correct,
friend.

200
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,280
In this war of righteousness

201
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,250
every contribution is precious.

202
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,260
What can he gives me

203
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,150
that will become an opportunity
for victory for me?

204
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,180
Rendering the enemy
weak in a war

205
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,280
is also called an opportunity,
friend.

206
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,220
Guru Arjun

207
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,180
no armour is safe
from your arrows.

208
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,090
One would require
a holy armour for that.
