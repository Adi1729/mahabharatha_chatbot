This is a request from your grandfather.

Go and invite my liberation.

00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,320
Why do you keep rendering
my meditation futile?!

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,260
You had promised me

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,420
that when the time is right
you would help me

10

complete my meditation.

11
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,430
Each time you tried
to render my meditation futile

12
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,430
I resorted to even more
austere meditation.

13
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,340
You will have to help me.

Answer me King of Yakshas!
Answer me!

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,160
I was born again only to slay
His Excellency Bhishma.

16
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,300
And if I am unable to have
my revenge even in this life

17
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,300
then this life is worthless to me!

18
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,280
I shall destroy this body
and be born again!

19
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,290
Either help me make
this life of mine worthwhile

20
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,230
or commit sin of being
responsible for my death!

Mahadev

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,350
even this life that you gave me
was futile.

23
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,410
Allow me to die.

24
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,460
Grandsire will die

25
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,200
only when he gives up
his weapons, uncle

26
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,330
and he will do so

27
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,400
only before Shikhandini.

28
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,410
And because she is a woman

29
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,250
uncle had lady Shikhandini

30
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,380
barred from entering the battlefield.

31
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,420
But she has received a boon
from mahadev, Prince Dusshasan

32
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,420
and a boon granted by a God

33
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,290
can never be fruitless.

34
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,130
All of you need to stay cautious.

resides in the body of a woman

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,420
she will not become

38

the reason of grandsire's death
in this war.

39
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,330
Grandsire is invincible.

40
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,390
Defeating Grandsire is impossible.

41
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,410
Do you not say,
Govind

42
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,220
that fate does not require
an invitation?

43
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,410
Sister too will have to complete
her meditation

44
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,260
and enter the battlefield.

45
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,360
But we cannot create our next
strategy based on this belief Draupadi.

46
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,230
His excellency took a decision
today

47
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,270
that he will not slay anyone.

48
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,340
However, the army of the Kauravas

49
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,170
will indeed have his protection.

50
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,300
This war will continue
for eternity.

51
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,420
Even then neither will we attain success
nor the sons of Dhritarashtra.

52
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,360
And our army is getting depleted.

53
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,200
Now we have only two...

54
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,230
only two akshauhini army.

55
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,260
Very soon our army will be annihilated
and it is a rule of a war

56
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,330
that if an army gets destroyed
or when all the soldiers flee

57
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,140
the king of that army
must accept defeat.

58
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,410
In other words

59
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,420
as long as Grandsire alive

60
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,190
our victory is impossible.

61
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,200
If Grandsire remains alive for too long

62
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,330
then our defeat is inevitable.

63
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,410
If lady Shikhandini is unsuccessful
in her meditation

64
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,180
then this war of ours
will also be unsuccessful.

You seem to be forgetting brother Sahadev

67
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,200
the Mahadev Himself

68
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,270
had promised Lady Amba

69
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,340
that when she
aims at a noble deed

70
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,320
she will indeed become the cause
of His excellency's defeat.

71
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,160
Moreover, Mahadev's promise
can never be false.

72
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,300
That is why,
I had advised Shikhandini

73
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,430
to go to the King of Yakshas.

It means, Your Highness,
that I am here.

but now, no one will
accept you as a man either

Like a swan and a peacock
are equally beautiful

but neither does one of them

Years ago when you
stopped me from killing myself

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,150
you had made me a promise

that you would make me
a man for a day.

such an austere meditation.

Now, you must fulfill your promise.

you shall be a man.

no one will suspect you.

But do remember

98
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,190
you will transform into a man
this evening

99
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
but you shall stay a man only
till sundown tomorrow.

You have only one day
with you to discharge your duty.

Only one day.

mourn my absence.

Do not fret about my sacrifice.

always raised to grant one a boon

164
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,430
similarly grandsire's entire life

165
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,340
is filled with boons.

166
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,450
While attacking him.
It will feel as though

167
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,310
we are desecrating an idol 
of the Almighty.

168
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,450
Merely imagining grandsire's death
is driving a stake though our hearts.

169
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,400
Grandsire's presence would always give us

170
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,430
a feeling of great trust
and deep peace, Panchali.

171
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,500
From tomorrow,
the peace in our lives

172
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,390
will be lost forever.

173
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,420
But we have deemed this bloodshed
our duty, sons of Pandu.

174
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,390
The day this war had begun

175
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
It was decided then

176
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,370
that we must also slay
His excellency Bhishma.

177
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,450
For nine days straight

178
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,580
we have been trying to defeat
his excellency

179
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,290
and now when it is time to achieve
our objective

180
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,460
and my sister Shikhandini

181
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,550
made such grave sacrifice
for your victory

182
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,530
what is the meaning
of being so emotional?

183
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,430
Brother,

184
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,340
my lords are not at fault here.

185
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,430
The decision to wage a war
and to take an oath are of the mind

186
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,540
but the heart...

187
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,410
The heart knows neither
an argument nor any duty.

188
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,360
It shudders at the very thought
of death of a beloved person.

189
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,430
Govind

190
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,490
you need to show us
a way out now.

191
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,530
This is the peculiarity
of human nature, friend.

192
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,310
The way the moment a swing
reaches one end

193
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,510
it gets pulled toward
the opposite direction

194
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,350
and begins to move towards it similarly

195
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,510
an intelligent human being

196
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,580
begins to have contrary thoughts

197
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,550
the moment a task gets completed.

198
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,300
This very quality
is both his weakness

199
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,470
and his strength.

200
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,370
This is the very quality

201
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
that keeps a man away
from sins and atrocities.

202
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,480
However this very quality

203
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,490
also keeps him
from achieving success.

204
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,290
But what is the solution
to this dilemma, Vasudev?

205
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,490
The solution to this

206
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,300
can be offered only by
his excellency.
