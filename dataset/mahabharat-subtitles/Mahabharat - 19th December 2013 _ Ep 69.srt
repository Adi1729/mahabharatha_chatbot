1
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,960
But do remember, Arjun.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,100
This task will be exceedingly
difficult for you.

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,130
The truth is, this task will be
quite gruesome for you.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,130
If you wish, you may test me.
- Test you?

5
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,130
Alright.
Then let's go.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,000
We will move northward first
and then proceed to the East.

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,080
Subhadra

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,120
you should proceed
to the palace now.

9
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,410
'Murli Manohar'

10
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,340
'Mohan Murari.'

11
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,250
'In every form of yours'

12
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,310
'the things you do are lovely.'

13
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,210
'Murli Manohar'

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,410
'Mohan Murari.'

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,240
'In every form of yours'

16
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,250
'the things you do are lovely.'

17
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,320
'Whenever He breaks
a pot full of butter'

18
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,220
'Kanhaiya* is reminded of Yashoda, his mother.'
*Krishna

19
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,180
'Whenever He breaks
a pot full of butter'

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,150
'Kanhaiya is reminded of
Yashoda, his mother.'

21
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
'Though He is the
entire world's creator'

22
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,220
'Murari can't give up
his love for butter.'

23
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,220
'Murli Manohar'

24
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,150
'Mohan Murari.'

25
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,280
'In every form of yours'

26
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,280
'the things you do are lovely.'

27
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,110
'When with friends,
Kanhaiya is quite frisky'

28
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,290
'but this flute playing darling
can also be very naughty.'

29
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,240
'When with friends,
Kanhaiya is quite frisky'

30
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,190
'but this flute playing darling
can also be very naughty.'

31
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,050
'The one who pesters
the maidens of Bra") is He'

32
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,210
'and hence, the maidens
chase Girdhar Murari.'

33
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,220
'Murli Manohar'

34
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,150
'Mohan Murari.'

35
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,020
'In every form of yours'

36
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,020
'the things you do are lovely.'

37
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,180
'Kanhaiya is kind...'

38
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,190
'Kanhaiya is a kind buddy,
unparalleled in the world'

39
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,240
'never oblivious to agony.'

40
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,110
'To help man, he is ever ready.'

41
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,140
'Wondrous are
the deeds of Murari.'

42
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,210
Labour seems to have
magnified my strength, Madhav.

43
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,940
No, friend.

44
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,110
Helping that man has
magnified your strength.

45
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,950
Helping people always
magnifies one's strength.

46
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,080
Let's go, friend.
- 'Murli Manohar'

47
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,910
'Mohan Murari.'

48
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,110
'In every form of yours'

49
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,080
'the things you do are lovely.'

50
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,910
'In every form of yours'

51
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,140
'the things you do are lovely.'

52
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,080
So, this is Kundanpur.

53
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,080
It is far more prosperous
than I had heard of.

54
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,070
Indeed, friend.

55
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,110
This is the capital of Vidarbha.

56
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,180
And over there you can see

57
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,110
the palace of
the King of Vidarbha.

58
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,950
The main entrance is over there.

59
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,950
Then why have we come here?

60
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,050
Friend, we have
come here because

61
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,880
we need to enter the city.

62
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,040
But we cannot take
the main entrance

63
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,970
because it will be guarded
by the soldiers of Vidarbha.

64
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,850
But Madhav, you said
you were invited to the wedding.

65
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,920
I wasn't invited to be
a part of the wedding, friend.

66
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,040
I have been invited here
as the groom.

67
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,820
The marriage
of Princess Rukmini

68
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,010
has been arranged with
the Prince of Chedi, Shishupal.

69
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,010
The entire region of Arya
know about it.

70
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,020
But Rukmini will be
married to me

71
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,070
but you are fortunate

72
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,080
because only you know about it
in the entire Aryan region.

73
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,910
What do you mean?

74
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,810
What do I mean?

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,880
Read it, friend.

76
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,780
'Srutva Gunan Bhuvana-Sundara'

77
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,850
'Srinvatam Te.'

78
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,840
What is this?

79
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,810
A letter, friend.

80
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,940
A love letter.

81
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,840
Who wrote it?

82
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,970
The Princess of Vidarbha,
Rukmini.

83
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,880
'Bhuvana-Sundara!'
The most beautiful in the world!

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,810
Who, Madhav?

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Me, friend.
Who else?

86
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,850
'Tan Me Bhavan Khalu
Vritah Patir Anga Jayam.'

87
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,880
I... I have accepted you
as my husband!

88
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,940
'Vidarbhan Guptah Sametya.'

89
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,750
She asks you to come
to Vidarbha secretly.

90
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,950
Is this why you have
brought me here

91
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,910
instead of the main entrance?

92
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,820
We need to enter
the city secretly, friend

93
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,950
for the purpose of marriage.

94
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,980
We need to enter
the city secretly, friend

95
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,980
for the purpose of marriage.

96
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,030
But...

97
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,070
If a father has not
organized a 'swayamvar'

98
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,070
is it right to abduct
his daughter, Madhav?

99
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,810
Whether a 'swayamvar'
is organized or not

100
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,910
abducting a woman
against her wishes

101
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,110
is always wrong, friend.

102
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,840
The truth is, every living being

103
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,810
has the freedom to live his life
on his own terms

104
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,910
and it's a God-given right.

105
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,970
And snatching this freedom
is indeed wrong, friend.

106
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,000
And today, this wrong deed

107
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,040
is being committed
by Rukmini's brother.

108
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,900
I am merely going to save a
woman from this misdeed, friend.

109
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,880
Then give me the order, Madhav.

110
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,780
The mere sound
of my bow being plucked

111
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,930
will shatter the fortress
of Vidarbha!

112
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,040
This is what I was
afraid of, Arjun.

113
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,770
This is what I fear.

114
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,870
Rukmini has instructed
clearly in the letter

115
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,010
that her family members
should not get hurt.

116
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,970
We cannot engage
in a battle with them.

117
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,910
Besides, friend.
When eloping is easier

118
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,840
why engage in violence
unnecessarily?

119
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,710
You need to meet Rukmini
secretly and tell her

120
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,750
that as mentioned in the letter

121
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,880
I will wait for her in
the temple of Goddess Parvati.

122
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Meet her secretly, Madhav?

123
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,930
What disguise will we be in?

124
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,910
Yes!

125
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,800
Disguise...

126
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,840
I will dress up as a cowherd.

127
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,740
I have quite the practice
in being one.

128
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,840
And what about me, Madhav?

129
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Stop!
What have you got there?

130
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,770
Some 'kheer.'
It's a sacrament.

131
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,830
Who are you?

132
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,680
I am Gopal.

133
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,840
The one who raises cows.

134
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,710
No one is allowed
to enter this place.

135
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,870
People are not allowed to enter?

136
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,640
Yes.

137
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,870
Alright.

138
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,840
Sire, I have got it now.

139
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,710
That Yadava...
Krishna!

140
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
He has tarnished the reputation
of us cowherds.

141
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,710
He has committed such deeds

142
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,610
that even heavily armoured
soldiers like you

143
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,750
are afraid of us cowherds.

144
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,610
It's alright.
- We are not afraid.

145
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,640
Then may I g-go
and deliver this 'kheer?'

146
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,640
To Prince Shishupal.

147
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,750
Alright.
You can enter.

148
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,830
But you need to be back soon.

149
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,710
As you say, sire.

150
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,540
Thank you.
As you say.

151
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,710
Come here!

152
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,770
Brihannala!

153
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,440
Who is she?

154
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,440
She is my sister, sire.
Her name is Brihannala.

155
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,340
She is taller and bigger
than most women.

156
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,310
Hence, our mother
named her Brihannala.

157
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,290
Let's go.

158
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,400
Madhav.

159
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,540
What kind of a disguise
is this, Madhav?

160
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,340
I had told you, friend

161
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,340
this task is going to be
quite gruesome for you.

162
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,390
Better get used to it.

163
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,440
Who knows when it might just
come in handy to you.

164
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,500
And even the name of Brihannala.

165
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,300
Friend

166
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,430
that is Rukmi.

167
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,270
Rukmini's elder brother.

168
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,340
The Crown Prince of Vidarbha.

169
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,430
We should ask him as to where
Rukmini's chamber is.

170
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,200
What are you saying, Madhav?

171
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,370
He will find out about
your true identity.

172
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,430
Even you don't know
my true identity, friend.

173
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,440
Then he has no chance
of knowing it.

174
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,200
Hold this.

175
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,340
Prince! Give me
your blessings, Prince!

176
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,330
Bless you.
Who are you?

177
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,260
Prince, the great sage Durvasa
has sent this sacrament.

178
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,290
As he is busy
with another undertaking

179
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,200
he will be unable
to attend the wedding.

180
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,240
So, he has sent this sacrament
for the groom and the bride.

181
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,400
Alright. Give that to me.
- N-No, Prince.

182
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,300
He had said that only the groom
and the bride can touch it

183
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,210
otherwise it will
get unsanctified.

184
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,200
Alright.
Deliver it yourself.

185
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,360
Deliver it myself, Prince?

186
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,130
Prince, my sister Brihannala.

187
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,260
She can deliver the sacrament
to the Princess

188
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,310
but only if you permit it.

189
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,200
Alright but not right away.

190
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,260
She can deliver it to the
chamber upstairs after a while.

191
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,230
To that chamber?

192
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,330
As you say, Prince!

193
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,230
Madhav, you touched his feet!

194
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,330
Friend, he is Rukmini's
elder brother.

195
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,330
So, I had to touch his feet.

196
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,030
Besides, who knows

197
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,070
whether in the future,
we will get his blessings

198
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,580
or not.

199
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,200
Was that sacrament really sent
by the great sage Durvasa?

200
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,170
Are you doubting me, friend?

201
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,300
It was indeed sent by him.

202
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,800
His hermitage is very
close-by to Dwaraka.

203
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,660
I had asked for it for the groom
and the bride myself.

204
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,070
Hold this.

205
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,070
Friend, I am the groom.

206
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,240
Hence, I was bound
to consume this sacrament.

207
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,130
Now, you must go.

208
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,140
Bring Rukmini to the temple
of the Goddess in three hours.

209
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,140
I shall be waiting for you.
- 'Murli Manohar'

210
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,110
'Mohan Murari.'

211
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,230
'In every form of yours'

212
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,130
'the things you do are lovely.'

213
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,200
'In every form of yours'

214
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,170
'the things you do are lovely.'
