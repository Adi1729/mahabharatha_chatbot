1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,250
It is being announced to
the entire Kuru dynasty

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,160
that the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru family Kunti

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,330
has given birth to the
heir of the Kuru family.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,290
The one who displays
auspicious characteristics

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,320
the one with numerous
positive qualities...

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,320
Such a son has been born

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,300
in the family of
Emperor Shantanu.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,260
On this happy occasion

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,190
King Dhritarashtra himself

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,380
will announce the celebrations
in the kingdom.

11
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,350
Subjects of the kingdom

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,260
and people present
in the court!

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,250
By the grace of God

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,200
today, the ancestors
of the Kuru family

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,130
would be pleased.

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,250
An heir to take forward
the lineage

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,090
has been born
into the Kuru family.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,250
I am extremely happy that

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,150
my younger brother,
my dear Pandu

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,360
got this opportunity to
please the ancestors.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,220
On behalf of the royal family

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,100
there should be offerings,
sacraments

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,260
and prayers in all
of the kingdom.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,230
There should be abundant
charity and offerings.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,130
Like the sunrise

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,220
lights up the world
with happiness

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,120
in the same way, may the new
member of the Kuru family

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,320
fill the hearts of our subjects
with happiness and bliss...

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,250
Such should be
the arrangements.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,300
This is the order of the
Kuru king Dhritarashtra!

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,130
Hail King Dhritarashtra!

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,100
Hail King Dhritarashtra!

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,200
Hail King Dhritarashtra!

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,160
Hail King Dhritarashtra!

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,090
Hail King Dhritarashtra!

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,160
Hail King Dhritarashtra!

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,090
Where is the princess
of Gandhar?

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,090
Where is the woman who has
brought misfortune to me?

39
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,080
Your Majesty...

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,130
The Queen is sleeping.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,260
She has fallen asleep
with great difficulty.

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,230
Then, wake her up!

43
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,990
How can the one who made
my fortune sleep forever

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,050
sleep peacefully?

45
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,120
Gandhari!

46
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,130
Lord.

47
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,990
You!

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,120
Hundred!

49
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,090
You had promised me a 100
majestic sons, Gandhari!

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,060
Where are my 100 children?

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,150
Where is the heir to my throne?

52
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,180
The one who would make
my heart content

53
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,990
the one to redeem
me from desperation...

54
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,220
Where is my son?

55
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,960
Where is he, Gandhari?

56
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,050
Lord, I am confident.

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,190
The blessings of Lord Shankar*
cannot go in vain.
*A manifestation of meditative Shiva.

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,090
But what kind of blessing
has God given you?

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,950
A 100 sons who would
win over kingdoms

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,960
or a 100 sons who
would serve others?

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,190
They would lead
a life of humiliation

62
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,130
their father would lead
a life of humiliation.

63
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,990
Is that the boon
you got?

64
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,200
Had you really got
a boon

65
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,960
or is all of it fabricated?

66
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,930
Why haven't you
delivered yet, Gandhari?

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
No one can predict
birth and death.

68
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,150
I am not convinced with
the answer, Gandhari.

69
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,930
I have always been
disappointed by you.

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Always disappointed!

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,990
You mocked me by
blindfolding yourself.

72
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,150
Yet, I didn't remarry.

73
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,900
Look at Kunti!

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,060
Pandu married another woman

75
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,030
but still, she gifted
him with a son.

76
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,120
And me?

77
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,960
I gave your respect.

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
I was considerate
towards your feelings.

79
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
I made you the Queen.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,060
Yet, you didn't give me
a son at the right time.

81
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,960
That's why... You haven't gifted
a son at the right time

82
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
because...

83
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,900
I have honoured you
more than you deserve.

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,930
That was my mistake.

85
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,090
If you had a competitor

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,020
you would have delivered
a child by now.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,020
Yes, it was my mistake.

88
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,930
But, Gandhari, I will correct
my mistake very soon.

89
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,990
The way you have hurt me by not
delivering the baby on time

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,030
in the same way,
I will do something

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,030
which will hurt you
all your life, at each step.

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,930
It will hurt you at every step!
It will hurt you at every step.

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,890
Lord!

94
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,990
Gandhari.

95
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,900
It isn't good to cry in
such a condition, sister.

96
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,990
What else shall I do, brother?

97
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,920
When the clouds of misfortune
are hovering on me

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,860
I will obviously have to cry!
- No, Gandhari!

99
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
No!

100
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
Don't you think like
that, Gandhari.

101
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,930
You will give birth to a baby,
a blessing of Lord Shiva.

102
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,760
You shouldn't insult God by
addressing it as a misfortune.

103
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,930
Consider it as meditation.
- How long should I meditate?

104
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,900
How long should I wait?

105
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,830
How much more pain
do I have to bear?

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,990
The more a tree
stands under the sun

107
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,950
the sweeter its fruits are.

108
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,900
But my husband is
getting impatient.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,790
He cannot be blamed for it.

110
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,960
I have always disappointed
him as a wife.

111
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,930
Only disappointment.

112
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,920
After a long wait

113
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,800
I had attained my
husband's love.

114
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,920
That priceless possession is
slipping out of my hands.

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
No, Gandhari!

116
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,660
You shouldn't worry
about the king.

117
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,730
He has no control
over his anger.

118
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,920
But he wouldn't dare
to be unjust with you.

119
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,760
Because he knows

120
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,820
that you will be the one to
carry his 100 sons.

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,850
And no son

122
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,790
can love and respect a father

123
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,890
who is unjust to his mother.

124
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,760
The king must be aware of it.

125
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,760
Greetings, Queen.

126
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,850
Queen, a guard is here with
a message from the King.

127
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,620
What is the message?

128
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,830
The king has commanded
to go to his room.

129
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,820
But I have taken an oath.

130
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,690
I will not leave the temple
until... - Not you, my Queen.

131
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,630
The order...

132
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,800
What? - The order is for
your head maid.

133
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Is it for Sugadha?
- Yes, Queen.

134
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,620
The King has asked Sugadha
to beautify herself

135
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,600
and come to his room.

136
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,000
The King has ordered Sugadha
to come to his room.

137
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,200
Me?

138
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,250
Why?

139
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,260
Queen, I won't go.

140
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,000
I will not go, Queen.

141
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,030
Is this the idea
the King has come up with

142
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,990
to hurt me all my life?

143
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,150
What are you raving, maid?

144
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,060
Sugadha will not go.

145
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,960
Sugadha will go, brother.

146
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,120
If my husband has
decided to punish me

147
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,120
then, I accept his decision.

148
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,160
But, Gandhari...
- Please leave, Sugadha.

149
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Follow the King's order.

150
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,200
Go, Sugadha.

151
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,120
Sugadha, leave!

152
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,160
Brother, you too should leave.
I need to be alone.

153
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,020
Gandhari, let me
talk to the King.

154
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,050
You shouldn't decide
anything in a rush.

155
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,050
Brother, you should leave!

156
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,020
When someone loses hope
and his desires are shattered

157
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,920
his heart is full of anger.

158
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,950
He tries to punish the person

159
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,980
who he thinks, has
offended him.

160
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,960
But whenever we lose hope and
our desires are shattered

161
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,950
should we always blame
someone else for it?

162
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,890
There can be many reasons why
desires are left unfulfilled.

163
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,930
Some are unfulfilled
due to our fate

164
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,950
and some due to our destiny.

165
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,750
And sometimes, the
desires are such

166
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,830
that they cannot be fulfilled.

167
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,930
Without considering the
circumstances

168
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,790
it isn't right to blame someone.

169
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,920
Instead, it's vengeance.

170
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,990
The basis of justice is mercy

171
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,850
Pity.

172
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,990
And the basis of vengeance

173
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,990
is anger and pride.

174
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,820
It means...

175
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,920
Dealing with someone's offence
without being merciful

176
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,890
or to punish someone...

177
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,930
Isn't that being unfair?
Think for yourself.

178
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,850
What kind of a son are you?

179
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,950
You shouldn't torment
your mother.

180
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,790
What crime are you
punishing me for?

181
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,890
Why have you turned me helpless?

182
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Why have you turned me into
a culprit before my husband?

183
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,900
I have waited for your
birth every moment.

184
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,890
I dreamt about you all the time!

185
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,860
I observed several fasts
for your happiness!

186
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,800
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!

187
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,730
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!

188
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,760
Be the cause!

189
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,310
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!

190
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,540
Either take birth
or be the cause of my death!

191
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,280
Be the cause!

192
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,350
Move aside!
Has Gandhari delivered a baby?

193
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,280
What has she delivered?

194
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,300
Is it a son or a daughter?
Answer me!

195
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,440
Has Gandhari delivered a baby?
What has she delivered?

196
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,340
Is it a son or a daughter?
Answer me!

197
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,270
Aryavati. Rambha.

198
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,180
Where is my son?
How is he?

199
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,340
Why can't I hear him cry?
Is he alright?

200
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,240
Where is he?
Answer me!

201
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,210
Why isn't my son next to me?

202
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,240
Take me to my son...

203
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,210
Queen!

204
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,180
My son...
Where is my son?

205
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,140
Where is my son?

206
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,240
Son?

207
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,110
Not a son

208
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,180
you have given birth
to a lump of flesh.
