1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,010
So, Your Highness...

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,890
Do you approve of these rules?

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,920
I approve of them.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,080
Think once about it,
my darling.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,090
Your might just have to
bet your pride here.

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,910
The Emperor has made up his mind
to play till the end

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,850
and so must you.

8
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,010
I agree.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,080
Your Excellency

10
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,890
are you contented with this?

11
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,850
I am contented.

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,910
Your Excellency

13
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,020
in this game,
neither of the players

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,820
must engage in foul play
or break the rules

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,050
and to ensure that

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,020
you will have to stay
in the court till the end.

17
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,910
You are the only one

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,050
whom the entire court trusts.

19
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,920
Now, if the Empress wishes

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,820
then she may proceed
to the chamber of Her Highness

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,790
so that we may begin the game.

22
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,010
My Lord

23
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,980
something that
man takes pride in

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,750
and also has the right to

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,980
need not necessarily be
the same thing.

26
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,820
I have firm faith

27
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,910
that only after scrutinizing
both pride and right

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,910
will you place the bets.

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,980
You have my word.

30
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,650
Your Highness

31
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,780
will you throw the dice
on your own

32
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,650
or do you wish to have it done
by someone else?

33
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,880
Is there not a rule to throw
one's dice on one's own here?

34
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,710
Your Highness,
this is a right

35
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,620
which belongs to the player

36
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,580
and he

37
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,780
can give this right
to someone else.

38
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,810
The way I have given this right

39
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,690
to uncle.

40
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,620
My hands are proficient
in fighting with a mace

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,850
but worse than useless

42
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,690
in throwing the dice,
Your Highness.

43
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,650
King of Gandhar,
is it not true

44
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,750
that your dice
dance to your tunes?

45
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,660
His Excellency Bhishma had
compared the dice to fortune

46
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,690
Prince Arjun.

47
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,620
And if I had
the right to my fortune

48
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,660
then Gandhar would
never have met

49
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
with any injustice.

50
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
Your Highness.

51
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,540
Your Highness

52
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,620
do go ahead and tell us

53
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,680
who will go first.

54
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,590
I have limited property
with me, uncle

55
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,650
but the Emperor has the entire
Aryan region with him!

56
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,520
Hence, the person to go first

57
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,620
should be me,
Your Highness.

58
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,620
I agree,
brother Duryodhan.

59
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,450
Tell me what you would
like to bet first.

60
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,550
I have one lakh
gold coins with me

61
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,680
which I have obtained
with my own efforts.

62
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,610
I have the right to them

63
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,490
and take pride in them as well.

64
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,610
By participating
in various competitions

65
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,460
and emerging victorious

66
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,520
I have procured 5,000 horses.

67
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,620
Then I have my apparels
and jewellery.

68
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,520
My father had

69
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,650
presented me with five villages.

70
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,580
This is

71
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,650
all the property I have with me

72
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,520
to which I have the right

73
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,420
and take pride in as well.

74
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,390
I bet my entire property

75
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,650
in the first round!

76
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,480
The entire property in one go!

77
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,510
If you are defeated

78
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,590
then will you play just once
and put an end to this game?

79
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,610
But if I win this round

80
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,480
then all this property
will become double

81
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,610
beloved Nakul.

82
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,350
So, Your Highness...

83
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,580
Go on.

84
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,460
You also need to bet
objects of equal worth

85
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,610
in the first round.

86
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,390
Brother Duryodhan, the worth
of the objects bet by you

87
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,480
shall be matched
by me by betting

88
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,550
the objects which come
under my possession.

89
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,490
You must be familiar
with the game of dice.

90
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,580
These four pieces

91
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,450
leave their bases

92
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,350
traverse the entire path

93
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,460
and come back to their bases.

94
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,450
Your pieces

95
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,480
can capture those
of the Crown Prince

96
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,310
and remove them from the game.

97
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,360
The player who has

98
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,510
the most number
of pieces in the base

99
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,540
or

100
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,390
the one who captures
all the pieces of the opponent

101
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,420
and removes them from the game

102
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,480
is the winner.

103
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,490
I know the rules,
King of Gandhar.

104
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,480
Though I oppose this game
I am not ignorant of it.

105
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,520
Indeed.

106
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,550
Let the game of dice begin.

107
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,290
Splendid, Your Highness!
Splendid!

108
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
In the very first go,
your dice have

109
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,480
rolled out a sum of 12.

110
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,320
In other words,
you get to roll the dice again.

111
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,250
There you go,
Your Highness.

112
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,410
The game has had
a fantastic beginning.

113
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,390
My dice have also rolled out
a sum of 12.

114
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,210
So, I shall roll the dice again.

115
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,410
There you go,
Your Highness.

116
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,180
One of my pieces is
on a castle square.

117
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,490
Over here, neither can
your piece capture mine

118
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,380
nor jump and go beyond it.

119
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,210
Splendid, Your Highness!
Splendid!

120
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,310
You have captured a piece
of my beloved Duryodhan.

121
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,420
Your chances of winning
have increased.

122
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,350
And there is nothing surprising
about it, Your Highness.

123
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,360
I have heard that fortune

124
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,190
is a slave to supreme Emperors.

125
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,220
There you go,
King of Gandhar.

126
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,280
This proves that
fortune is impartial.

127
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,280
Now, I too have
only three pieces left.

128
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,360
You and I are
in the same boat now.

129
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,240
You and I are
in the same boat now.

130
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,130
Go on.
It is your turn now.

131
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,100
Look at these,
Empress.

132
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
All these apparels and jewellery

133
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,010
will be presented to you
by Hastinapur.

134
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,910
The moment the game of dice ends

135
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,070
the Emperor and Empress
will be honoured

136
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,940
by Hastinapur
by having a gala festival.

137
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,000
Only those people
get such an honour

138
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,970
who have not been
accepted whole-heartedly.

139
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,910
I do not crave presents or
such an honour, Your Highness.

140
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,040
Will the Kuru Princes
accept my husbands

141
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,880
and me as a part
of the Kuru dynasty?

142
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,100
All of you belong
to the Kuru dynasty

143
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,030
and everyone has
accepted that, dear.

144
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,960
Sister-in-law

145
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,910
what Draupadi meant was

146
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,100
that the board of 'chausar'
is not the battlefield.

147
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,000
First and foremost,
they must accept this.

148
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,010
The meaning of a game
is not winning or losing.

149
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,030
Its sole purpose
is entertainment

150
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,040
and they must understand this.

151
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,800
Your Highness

152
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,100
both the players now have
only one piece remaining.

153
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,840
The player whose piece
reaches its base first

154
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,030
will be the winner.

155
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,070
In order to win,
you need just

156
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,930
seven points.

157
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,970
Uncle

158
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I have bet all my dreams here
by putting my trust in you.

159
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,880
If your dice do not
roll in my favour

160
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,840
then there will be

161
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,840
a reversal in my fortune.

162
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,030
My darling

163
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,940
all my plans are made keeping
reversal of fortune in mind.

164
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,740
First, one must put an end
to the suspicions of the enemy

165
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
and then his confidence

166
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,740
kills him on its own.

167
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,970
The real game

168
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,930
has begun now.

169
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Your Highness,
let's see

170
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,780
what fortune has in store
for my beloved Duryodhan.

171
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,930
He needs

172
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,000
a score of 12.

173
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,970
Go on, dice...

174
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,840
12.

175
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,940
May His Highness have happiness!

176
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,670
Your Highness,
you have been defeated.

177
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,870
Greetings,
Her Highness.

178
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,640
The Crown Prince had bet
his entire property

179
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,700
but the Emperor has
lost the first round.

180
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,640
But the game is now over,
is it not?

181
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,900
No, Your Highness.

182
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,880
The Crown Prince is about to
place his second bet.

183
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
What will he bet this time?

184
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,730
Will you bet your whole property
again, brother Duryodhan?

185
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,790
We are done betting
our properties, Your Highness.

186
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,850
How much pride

187
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,900
can one take in one's property?

188
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,730
True pride

189
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,720
lies in relationships

190
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,850
Your Highness.

191
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,860
I take pride
in my brother Vikarna.

192
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,590
He is an ace archer

193
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,590
and as he is younger to me

194
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,720
I have the right to him.

195
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,700
My younger brother

196
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,730
Vikarna is my next bet.

197
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,730
And if I lose

198
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
then his entire life,
Vikarna

199
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,750
will be your servant.

200
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,650
So, Your Highness...

201
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,790
So, which

202
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,520
younger brother of yours
would you like to bet?
