1
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,990
Your Majesty, Prince Duryodhan
seeks your permission to enter.

2
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,930
Prince Duryodhan?
Leave!

3
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,020
What mistake did I make, Prince?

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,930
By seeking my permission
to enter

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,860
what could be
the reason for hurting me?

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,090
Get used to it, friend Karna.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,900
No.

8
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,930
King of Anga, Karna.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,090
Henceforth, I will always
have to seek your permission.

10
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,870
This is the tradition
of royal families.

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,830
You will be

12
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,860
senior to me by rank now.

13
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,930
I will always be junior to you
by rank, Prince.

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,860
A wheel is meant to travel

15
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,800
but when it is
joined to a chariot

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,890
it travels the whole world.

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,950
Otherwise

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,090
it just lies in the courtyard
of a potter

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,900
and is used to make
earthen pots.

20
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,060
I can never
forget the fact, Prince

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,000
that all this
prestige and respect

22
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,820
is being given to me
only because of you.

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,060
I will devote
the kingdom of Anga to you.

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,850
Only your kingdom?

25
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,060
It was never yours.

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,860
What else can you give me?

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,990
I can give you my life.

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,800
A warrior does not deem
his life valuable, King of Anga.

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,900
What else can you give me?

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,020
Why are you testing
my dedication, Prince?

31
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,030
The person I trusted the most

32
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,930
my own father is about to
renounce me, King of Anga!

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,830
Today, for the first time
in my life

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,770
I wish to test everyone.

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,990
What can you give me?

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,870
My mother and father
have already

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,800
been renounced by me for you.

38
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,960
Can you renounce righteousness?

39
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,930
Righteousness has always
been an obstacle in my life

40
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,700
King of Anga.

41
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,730
Can you renounce righteousness?

42
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,670
Renouncing righteousness has
never benefited anyone, Prince.

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,820
I have got my answer!

44
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,860
However

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,790
from this day forth

46
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,830
it will be my duty
to follow every order of yours.

47
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,890
Nothing else shall
lie above it for me.

48
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,760
We can declare a war
against Hastinapur, friend.

49
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,600
We can defeat the Pandavas
in the battle.

50
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,720
What decision have you made?

51
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,800
I have made my decision.

52
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,080
Attention everyone!
King Dhritarashtra

53
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,910
is making his entrance!

54
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,880
Yudhishthir.
- Greetings, uncle.

55
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,010
May you live long.

56
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,810
You should have called me.

57
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,940
Why did you take the pain of
coming to my chamber yourself?

58
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,910
Brother Arjun

59
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,850
I have a really bad feeling
regarding brother Yudhishthir.

60
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,810
You are the epitome
of righteousness.

61
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,810
Just think about it.

62
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,940
If Duryodhan revolts
against Hastinapur

63
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,750
what will be the duty of a King?

64
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,940
You will have to command an army

65
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,000
against Duryodhan.

66
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,810
And that army will be led by

67
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,010
the son of Ganga.

68
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,710
The son of Ganga, who

69
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,740
could not be defeated
even by Lord Parashuram.

70
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,710
Now, in this old age,
do I need to sacrifice my sons?

71
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,710
But Yudhishthir

72
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,980
a person who loses his sons
while he is alive

73
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,710
is left to face hell
before his death

74
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,880
and even after it.

75
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,940
What mistake did I make

76
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
that I am to suffer
such a fate, Yudhishthir?

77
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,680
What mistake did I make?

78
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,850
Give me the order, Your Majesty.

79
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,740
Not an order.

80
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,750
No...

81
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,680
Not even a wish.
Only...

82
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,910
It is only hope, dear.

83
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,940
The hope that you will
help your uncle

84
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,880
get over this pain.

85
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,850
To declare you the Crowned
Prince of Hastinapur is my duty.

86
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,780
It is my duty.
But dear

87
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,780
to take a decision that will
make your uncle happy

88
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,680
is also your duty, is it not?

89
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,810
If you yourself

90
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,750
give up your position
as Prince to Duryodhan then...

91
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,820
Then I will not only
perform my duty

92
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
but also regain my happiness.

93
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,820
Decide after
meditating over it, dear.

94
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,870
Decide after
meditating over it, dear.

95
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,880
Even Arjun and Sahadev are here.

96
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,950
Take into account
their suggestions as well.

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,880
There is no question
of meditating over it, uncle.

98
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,940
Every word uttered by you

99
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,810
is an order
to brother Yudhishthir.

100
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,770
It is an order
to all us brothers.

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,840
With your permission

102
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,710
I would like to
clarify a doubt, uncle.

103
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,780
Go ahead.

104
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,780
When the Monsoons begin

105
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,710
the King is the first
to till the land.

106
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,950
This is termed as 'Seet Yajna.'

107
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,940
I never quite understood
its meaning, uncle.

108
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,870
This is not the time to discuss
the 'Shastras,' Arjun.

109
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,880
Still, I will
answer your question.

110
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,680
When tilling the land

111
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,780
a farmer commits the sin
of killing many animals.

112
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,630
By performing the 'Seet Yajna,'
the King

113
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,530
acquires all the sins
of the farmer.

114
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,740
This is the reason why
every King after his death

115
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,680
even for a short period

116
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,900
spends time in hell, Arjun.

117
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,700
Then why does a King
commit a deed

118
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,870
that sends him to hell?

119
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,710
Dear

120
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,670
if a farmer renounces farming
out of the fear of hell

121
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
then the entire society
will go hungry.

122
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,800
And it is the duty
of a King to...

123
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,840
Can a King
not assign another person

124
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,680
to the 'Seet Yajna'
and save himself from hell?

125
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,610
Can the rules of righteousness
not be bent?

126
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,770
Yudhishthir

127
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,610
tomorrow at dawn

128
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,780
you will be anointed as
the Crowned Prince in the court.

129
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,700
Here you go, brother.

130
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Sister-in-law

131
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,910
why did you have
these apparels sent to me?

132
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,130
To examine them.

133
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,940
When your son
will be crowned the Prince

134
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,970
one among these apparels
will be placed on his shoulder.

135
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,100
You can choose any you like.

136
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,910
But sister-in-law, this right

137
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,970
belongs to the Queen.

138
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,000
But my eyes are covered.

139
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,870
You are more suited
to this task than me, Kunti.

140
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,140
The question is not about rights

141
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,870
but worthiness.

142
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,910
Sister-in-law, is the victory
of the Princes

143
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,030
making you unhappy?

144
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,030
Kunti, the victory of your sons
does not make me unhappy.

145
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,110
But the defeat of my sons
is certainly causing me pain.

146
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,910
If you want

147
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,980
Duryodhan to be
the Crowned Prince...

148
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
No, Kunti.

149
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,810
I am the Queen.
For the welfare of the kingdom

150
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,000
I will do everything
required of me.

151
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,910
But

152
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,910
I am also a mother.

153
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,930
The ambition of my son
will go unfulfilled

154
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,000
and I have the right
to grieve over it.

155
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,800
Let's go, Kunti.

156
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,910
It is almost time for the
anointing of the Crowned Prince.

157
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,930
Why do I feel as though

158
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,030
because of this, you

159
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,770
and I are becoming distant?

160
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,000
When we had
unhappiness in our lives

161
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,770
you and I were close.

162
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,930
Now, you have been blessed
with happiness, Kunti.

163
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,900
Unhappiness brings people close.

164
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,030
