1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,220
Uncle!

2
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,360
Why did His Highness
imprison my sons, uncle?

3
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,350
What... What crime
have they committed?

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,280
I have come here
to find out exactly that.

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,280
Do hurry, uncle.

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,350
I...

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,320
I am not dispensing
advice to you.

8
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,390
If an onion falls into the milk
and is not taken out soon

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,290
then the entire milk
reeks of onion.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,380
Same is the case with the
reputation of human beings.

11
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,250
If...

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,380
If this news spreads across
the Aryan region then...

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,120
Then what will happen
to the reputation of my sons?

14
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,290
Dhritarashtra!

15
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,280
A 'yajna' is performed
to earn merit

16
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,120
and not to wash away one's sins.

17
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,190
One needs to bathe in the Ganges
to wash away one's sins.

18
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,160
This 'yajna' will not
wash away your sins!

19
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Great Bhishma

20
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,120
Why such anger?!

21
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,210
Ask your husband,
Gandhari!

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,120
He has imprisoned the Pandavas!

23
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,280
People who dare to take
to arms in the court

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,280
get punished, uncle.

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,020
You had told me that the culprit
who does not get punished

26
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,090
becomes the source of motivation
to other culprits.

27
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,310
Yes, I did say that.

28
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,090
That is the exact reason

29
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,280
why I cannot let you commit
this crime too, Dhritarashtra!

30
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,250
You cannot imprison
the Pandavas!

31
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,180
Release them!

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,120
King Dhritarashtra

33
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,050
cannot be commanded
by you, grandsire.

34
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,060
Respect the polity
of His Highness.

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,050
Foolish Duryodhan!

36
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,210
This polity exists
only because of me!

37
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,280
And I can snatch it if I like!

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,250
I had told you before.

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,080
If I see Hastinapur
succumbing to unrighteousness

40
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,060
then I shall take to arms
against it

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,020
and that will not
break my oath either.

42
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,210
You may certainly give a minor
punishment to Arjun, My Lord

43
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,090
but what are you
punishing the rest for?

44
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,060
Release the Pandavas,
My Lord.

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,950
Your Highness

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,020
I think so too.

47
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,090
Be quiet, uncle!

48
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,050
No, grandsire.

49
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,180
The order of His Highness
cannot be taken back.

50
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,110
And neither will he do so.

51
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,950
Dhritarashtra!

52
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,020
So, is this your
ultimate decision?

53
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Splendid.

54
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,150
Now, I shall take my decision.

55
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,110
Great Bhishma...

56
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Great Bhishma!

57
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Great Bhishma.

58
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,910
Great Bhishma!

59
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,890
That was utter foolishness!

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,890
Uncle, but you had said...

61
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,820
I had said so but now

62
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,020
I am going back on my words.

63
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Politics is just like gambling,
my darlings.

64
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
If the dice defects

65
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
then one must also learn
to change one's tactics.

66
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,010
Do you wish to see Bhishma's
strength and majesty

67
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,850
beloved Duryodhan?

68
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,080
Just like the Almighty

69
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
the great Bhishma

70
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,890
can annihilate all your plans.

71
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,050
Do you wish to see this,
beloved Duryodhan?

72
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,890
Come with me.

73
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,880
Stop, soldiers!

74
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,690
The Pandavas will not
retaliate against you

75
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,750
because they are duty bound.

76
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,780
However, I shall
retaliate against you

77
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,910
because I am bound by my oath.

78
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,880
Either fight me

79
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,880
or release the Pandavas.

80
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,820
Grandsire, because of us

81
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,750
you cannot revolt against
the throne of Hastinapur.

82
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,780
We are not as valuable
as your oath.

83
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,640
Dear Yudhishthir

84
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,880
my oath has value

85
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,780
only because of you.

86
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Soldiers

87
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,880
pick up your weapons!

88
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,270
Did you see that,
my darling?

89
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,480
If that old man

90
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,330
is not on your side
then you will be

91
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,370
left with no army.

92
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,440
Even if the Pandavas
leave Hastinapur

93
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,370
then some other King
of the Aryan region

94
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,400
will attack Hastinapur.

95
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
That old man's absence

96
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,380
will leave Hastinapur empty

97
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,370
just like Nandi's* absence would leave

98
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Kailash** so.
*, ** An anthropomorphic deity who was one of Shiva’s two door-keepers of Kailash.

99
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,430
Do you understand,
my darling?

100
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,400
Tell His Highness

101
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,210
to apologize
to the great Bhishma.

102
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,400
Tell him to be prepared.

103
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,170
Uncle.

104
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Minister

105
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,400
I have taken the decision

106
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,210
that if His Highness

107
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,270
does not declare
Yudhishthir King

108
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,180
then I shall not stay
in Hastinapur!

109
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,170
Grandsire

110
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,140
please calm down.

111
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,130
Your love and faith mean
more to us than any kingdom.

112
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,110
That is not adequate.

113
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,110
This kingdom has always
housed righteousness

114
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,300
and it will continue to do so.

115
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,130
Uncle

116
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,270
give me the opportunity
to look for another solution.

117
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,300
You need not look for another
solution, Minister Vidur.

118
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,140
His Highness expresses remorse

119
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,100
over his deed.

120
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,140
Prince Arjun

121
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,300
for the crime of taking
to arms in the court

122
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,270
His Highness has ordered
you and all my nephews

123
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,270
to fast for a day
as punishment.

124
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,200
Crown Prince

125
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,200
His Highness apologizes to you.

126
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,100
To all of you.

127
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,240
Will you not pardon
your uncle, Crown Prince?

128
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,240
We do not have the right to
pardon uncle, King of Gandhar.

129
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,300
He pardoned us

130
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,010
and we are glad to hear it.

131
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,080
You are very generous,
Crown Prince.

132
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,270
Your Excellency

133
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,140
by touching your feet,
His Highness

134
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,010
wishes to apologize to you.

135
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,170
If you come by his chamber

136
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,040
then he would be
grateful to you.

137
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,030
Go on.

138
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,170
I will be there.

139
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,070
Thank you,
Your Excellency.

140
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,130
Goodbye, Minister.

141
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,910
You were correct, Vidur.

142
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,130
Water and oil

143
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,010
can never be kept
in the same container.

144
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
I feel as though

145
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,010
the division of this kingdom

146
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,170
is the only way out.

147
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,560
Dividing this beloved land
of our ancestors

148
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,610
will leave neither you
nor us happy.

149
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,680
It would be better
if we leave Hastinapur.

150
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,610
Dear Yudhishthir

151
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,460
you may leave Hastinapur

152
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,410
but only as a King

153
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,380
and not a hermit.

154
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,410
Dear Yudhishthir

155
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,350
through the medium of Vidur,
mother Satyavati has ordered me

156
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,620
to declare you King.

157
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,450
I could not help you get
the entire Kuru kingdom

158
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,620
but

159
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,560
by helping you get half of it

160
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,510
I shall have some solace.

161
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,410
But brother Yudhishthir
has the right

162
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,580
to the entire kingdom,
grandsire.

163
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,550
If you tell him to

164
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,620
then uncle will have to declare
brother Yudhishthir the King.

165
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,490
Then why this division?

166
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
Dear Bheem

167
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,320
a person sitting in the shade
of a tree seems dark.

168
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,550
The shade of the tree

169
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,290
taints the complexion
of that person.

170
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,510
If you stay with the sons
of Dhritarashtra here

171
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,510
then your righteousness
will get tainted as well.

172
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,320
This is what I fear.

173
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,520
That is why

174
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,420
division is the sole way out.

175
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,390
We know what
righteousness is, grandsire.

176
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,290
But without your guidance

177
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,480
how will we know
what the desired action is?

178
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
Dear

179
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,460
I too shall come with you.

180
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,450
I had promised my father

181
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,220
that I shall protect
his throne my entire life.

182
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,410
And his throne is where

183
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
there is righteousness.

184
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,510
In other words

185
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,450
in Yudhishthir's kingdom.
