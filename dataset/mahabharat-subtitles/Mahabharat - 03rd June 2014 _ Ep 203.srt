1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,430
Tomorrow's war

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,530
is the result of that oath.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,360
No, Vasudev.

4
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,300
Tomorrow's war

5
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,240
is the result of
Hastinapur's arrogance.

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,240
By displaying its might,
Hastinapur

7
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,240
had covered my
beloved sister's fortune

8
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,400
with a cloth of darkness.

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,330
That day

10
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,400
I promised myself

11
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,430
that Hastinapur

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,240
will either give
my sister a present

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,310
for her sacrifice

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,240
or

15
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,400
pay dearly for it.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,270
Getting a present and
paying dearly for a sacrifice!

17
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,270
One who deems sacrifice
a business dealing

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,370
certainly experiences agony.

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,230
It is such a strange thing!

20
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,410
Your sister made a sacrifice

21
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,170
but it was turned
into a business dealing

22
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,170
by you.

23
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,330
The truth is

24
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,330
under the garb
of exacting revenge

25
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,170
you wished to have opulence
and supreme power.

26
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,170
By calling your actions
a sacrifice

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,370
do not deceive yourself,
King of Gandhar.

28
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,300
Deception.

29
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,270
Deception!

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,130
Am I deceiving people
or are you

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,290
Vasudev?

32
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,230
By calling this war
a righteous one

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,140
you are deceiving
the entire Aryan region.

34
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,100
In the entire world

35
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,270
if there is someone
more wily than me

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,170
then it is

37
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,140
you, Vasudev.

38
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,140
I have firm faith

39
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,140
that in this war
of righteousness of yours

40
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,070
you will indeed use deceit
to justify

41
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,340
unrighteousness.

42
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,240
This is indeed a war of
righteousness, King of Gandhar.

43
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,110
In this war,
both might

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,170
and deceit shall be used.

45
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,300
To establish righteousness,
unrighteousness shall be used.

46
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,140
To safeguard the truth,
lies

47
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,070
will be told.

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,170
To champion life,
death shall be welcomed.

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,210
To usher the new creation,
the old

50
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,330
shall be annihilated.

51
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,000
Such faith!

52
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,260
Do you have such faith

53
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,060
in the competence
of the Pandavas?

54
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,060
No.

55
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,230
I have such faith

56
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,190
in you

57
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,110
and your deception.

58
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,200
I had told you

59
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,060
that various situations
have arisen and you

60
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,030
have been bound
to them in such a way

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,160
that in the end,
every deception of yours

62
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,100
will benefit only the Pandavas.

63
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,270
That is why,
King of Gandhar

64
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,130
you must now engage in deception

65
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,030
only after meditating over it.

66
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,130
From tomorrow,
every deception of yours

67
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,060
every treachery of yours

68
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,140
and every unrighteous deed
of yours shall meet its match.

69
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,200
Do remember that.

70
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,040
You need to remember

71
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,970
Vasudev

72
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,100
that you have taken an oath

73
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,130
of not taking to arms
in this war.

74
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,000
I have taken an oath

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,100
of not taking to arms
in this war, King of Gandhar.

76
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,970
However,
my might

77
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,900
is not my weapon.

78
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,940
In this battlefield, I bear
the might of righteousness.

79
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,940
That is my weapon

80
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,900
and also my armour.

81
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,030
And I am

82
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,130
the armour of your
beloved Pandavas.

83
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,970
Look at this battlefield.

84
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,030
The war will begin here at dawn.

85
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,870
Before dusk

86
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,900
there will be
so many corpses here

87
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,000
that even stones will float
in a river of blood.

88
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,930
There will be so much
bloodshed here

89
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,910
that the soil of this land
will remain red for eternity.

90
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,960
And I promise

91
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,070
that whoever dies
in this gruesome war

92
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,860
will indeed realize what
righteousness is at the end.

93
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,040
The purpose of this war
is to establish righteousness

94
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,030
and till the end of time

95
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,030
it shall be known as Mahabharat,
the war of righteousness.

96
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,800
Friend Karna

97
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,770
what have you done?

98
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,830
You gave away your armour
and ear-rings as charity!

99
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,870
They were a part of you,
friend Karna.

100
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,830
How could you chop off a part
of your body and give it away?

101
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,970
Had a treacherous person
asked you for your right arm

102
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,800
would you have
given it away as well?

103
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,770
Why did you act
so foolishly, friend?

104
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,870
Why did you act so foolishly?

105
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,770
What good is duty

106
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,770
if, in the process of
discharging it, might, future

107
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,970
hope and even life
have to sacrificed?

108
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,760
When everything needs
to be sacrificed, friend...

109
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,970
Pardon me,
friend.

110
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,800
Pardon me.

111
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,700
Had I broken one oath of mine

112
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,970
I would have had the thought
of breaking another.

113
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,760
And possibly

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,730
in the battlefield

115
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,800
I would not have been able
to discharge my duties, friend.

116
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,900
I

117
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,860
shall heal soon,
friend.

118
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,830
My darling

119
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,700
let's go.

120
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,730
The healer

121
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,700
will take care
of King Karna of Anga.

122
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,600
I had told you,
my darling!

123
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,670
His righteousness is his limit!

124
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,700
And King Karna of Anga

125
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,740
has great pride
in his righteousness!

126
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,700
Do you remember what your guru,
the mighty Balaram had said?

127
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,640
Whenever righteousness
and pride come together

128
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,610
man meets with loss.

129
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,630
This is the reason

130
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,640
why Yudhishthir had accepted
to go on an exile

131
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,640
while he wishes
to exit this world.

132
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,610
This is the reason
why King Karna of Anga

133
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,660
never had my complete trust.

134
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,830
I was alluding

135
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,800
to the armour and ear-rings
of King Karna of Anga.

136
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,590
And now,
they are gone.

137
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,760
Now,
let him go as well.

138
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,570
But uncle...
- This is not the time

139
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,800
for 'ifs' and 'buts,'
my darling!

140
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,700
The holy armour
of King Karna of Anga

141
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,760
is gone!

142
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,760
At a time like this

143
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,500
it is important to augment

144
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,570
our army...

145
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,570
And there is going to be

146
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,700
an addition of
two 'akshauhini' armies

147
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,800
to our existing army.

148
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
Karna...
Karna!

149
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,150
Karna.
- Son!

150
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,160
Karna...
- My Lord! - Son!

151
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Healer

152
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,050
why is his breathing
so irregular?

153
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,250
His condition is critical.

154
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,220
Upon cutting out
the holy armour and ear-rings

155
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,030
the resulting wounds
on King Karna of Anga

156
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,100
are not healing
with the traditional herbs.

157
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,030
We cannot do anything for him.

158
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,130
But healer,
my son is in great agony.

159
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,250
Do something.

160
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,130
Radha

161
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,200
Karna will indeed get better.

162
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,190
Have faith.
- Faith?!

163
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,990
On whom?
You?!

164
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,120
The mother of the people who
robbed my son of his divinity

165
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,960
is reassuring me!

166
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,960
Be quiet,
Radha.

167
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
No,
My Lord.

168
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,000
I will not be quiet today.

169
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,030
What kind of an enmity made them

170
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,060
snatch my son's divinity
from him?

171
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,190
In order to secure
the victory of your children

172
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,060
you engaged in such treachery!

173
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,050
How can you even call yourself
a righteous person?!

174
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,220
Please believe me,
Radha.

175
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,150
I have engaged
in no such treachery.

176
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,100
Then why did
the father of your son

177
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,050
take away the divinity
of my Radheya?

178
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,090
Did he think that just because
he is the son of a charioteer

179
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,920
he could act treacherously
with him?!

180
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,160
My son was born to be
seated on the throne.

181
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,960
But he

182
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,090
grew up deeming the lap of his
impoverished father a throne.

183
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,060
My son had the capability

184
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,090
of standing tall next to
the greatest of Kings

185
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,090
but his childhood

186
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,120
was spent standing behind
domestic help.

187
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,120
The armour and ear-rings
denoted his divinity

188
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,020
but they were
snatched from him as well!

189
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,090
For safeguarding
the lives of your sons

190
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
do accept my greetings,
Queen Mother!

191
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,860
But you have murdered my son!

192
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,890
You have murdered my son...

193
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,090
Do not say that,
Radha.

194
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Karna...

195
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,960
Karna is my son.

196
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,960
No!
Had he been your son

197
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,020
he would never have met
with such treachery!

198
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,030
If you say
that Karna is your son

199
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,920
then please save his life.

200
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,090
Your sons,
Nakul and Sahadev

201
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,950
have been blessed
by the Ashwini Kumaras.

202
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,860
I request you

203
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,830
to alleviate the agony
of my son, Queen Mother!

204
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,860
Alleviate it...

205
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,950
Queen Mother

206
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,920
can Prince Sahadev
and Prince Nakul

207
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,850
heal My Lord,
their elder brother...

208
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,920
Can they deem him
their elder brother

209
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,830
and heal him?

210
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,760
No, Vrushali.

211
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,950
Why would they do that?

212
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,920
My son is their enemy after all.

213
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,890
And who can ever save
the life of one's enemy?

214
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,430
In a battle,
it is a rule

215
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,340
that if the entire army
gets annihilated

216
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,340
or all the soldiers
flee from the battlefield

217
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,310
then the King must surrender.

218
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,300
The King cannot even challenge
the enemy to a duel then.

219
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,430
That is why, in order to sustain
in the battlefield

220
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,240
we require a large army.

221
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,240
We have
a seven 'akshauhini' army

222
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,210
while our enemies have nine.

223
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,330
We must acquire an additional
two 'akshauhini' armies

224
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,430
at any cost.

225
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,340
Ruler of Madra,
King Shalya

226
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,340
the elder brother
of Mother Madri.

227
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,370
Nakul has
requested him to aid us.

228
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,310
The two 'akshauhini' army of his

229
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,240
is just as mighty
as the Narayani Army.

230
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,380
Very soon, uncle Shalya
shall be here with his army.

231
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,270
In other words,
our army

232
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,370
will be as big and mighty
as that of the Kauravas.

233
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
We have also arranged
for them to rest on the way

234
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,240
brother Yudhishthir.

235
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,330
Sons...

236
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,200
Mother.

237
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Mother

238
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,300
is there a problem?

239
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,370
There is bound to be a problem,
brother Yudhishthir.

240
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,210
Our mother is residing
in the enemy camp.

241
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,440
She was residing there,
brother Bheem.

242
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,270
Now,
she has come to us.

243
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,370
Greetings, mother.

244
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,260
Greetings, mother.

245
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
What is the matter,
mother?

246
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,310
Why do you not seem happy?

247
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,140
Even after meeting your sons
after such a long time

248
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
are you not happy?

249
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,160
No, son.

250
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,270
A mother is weeping here

251
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
and it is time to wipe away

252
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,340
the tears of that mother.

253
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,370
Whose mother?

254
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,340
The mother
of King Karna of Anga.

255
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,180
Nakul, Sahadev

256
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,230
the two of you need to
come with me this instant.

257
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,180
King Karna of Anga
is in great agony, sons.

258
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,260
What is the matter,
mother?

259
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,110
What agony?
- Son

260
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,140
King Karna of Anga
is gravely wounded.

261
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,170
If...
If he does not receive

262
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,200
the holy herbs from Nakul
and Sahadev soon then...

263
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,210
Then finding a remedy to his
agony will become impossible.

264
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,210
Please pardon me,
Queen Mother Kunti, but

265
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,140
if the soldiers of the Kaurava
army get injured in the war

266
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,110
then will they be treated by
Prince Nakul and Prince Sahadev?

267
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,330
Then there is no point
in waging a war.

268
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,110
The war has not begun yet.

269
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,100
And at a time like this

270
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,270
it is our duty to protect
the life of an injured person.

271
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,040
King Karna of Anga would never
have mercy on your sons, mother.

272
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,230
Had there been kindness
or righteousness in his heart

273
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,260
your daughter-in-law would
not have been subjected

274
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,210
to grave humiliation during
the game of dice, mother.

275
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,270
Man behaves according to
the circumstance he is in, son.

276
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,040
At the moment

277
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,130
the circumstances are different.

278
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,140
How is today's situation
any different, mother?

279
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Sons

280
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,130
the King of Anga...

281
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,240
King Karna of Anga...
