1
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,068
Greetings, mother.

2
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:59,140
Today, you have returned
to your mother, son.

3
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:01,073
No, mother.

4
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:05,246
Today, I am here to bathe
in your holy water

5
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,115
to wash away my sin.

6
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:10,090
You are my son, Devavrata.

7
00:01:10,294 --> 00:01:13,127
You cannot commit a sin.

8
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,031
But I have committed
a sin, mother.

9
00:01:18,102 --> 00:01:20,195
To secure the future
of Hastinapur

10
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,131
I have sacrificed
the happiness of a maiden.

11
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:29,012
I did not even ask her
what she wanted.

12
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:33,081
Whether Gandhari was ready
to accept a blind husband..

13
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,243
I made no effort
to find out about it.

14
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:38,120
Did she protest, my child?

15
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:40,088
Not explicitly
through words but

16
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,289
her oath to keep her eyes
covered for life

17
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,189
is a form of her protest,
mother.

18
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,190
When you had taken an oath,
Devavrata

19
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,238
were you filled with protest
back then?

20
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,236
After so many years..

21
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:02,142
Why are you asking me
this question, mother?

22
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,146
Look within your heart, son.

23
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,074
There are moments in life

24
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:11,249
when we are compelled
to engage in retrospection.

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,149
This is termed as
bathing in river Ganges.

26
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:17,288
No, mother.

27
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:21,257
I can say with
complete authenticity

28
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,035
that while taking the oath,
I had nothing

29
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,161
other than concern
for my father's happiness

30
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,037
and the integrity of Hastinapur
in my heart.

31
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,130
And even today, I feel so.

32
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,200
Had Gandhari objected
to the marriage

33
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,036
would you have attacked
the kingdom of Gandhar?

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,104
No, mother.

35
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:43,051
Your son would never disrespect
the wish of any woman.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,020
Then you are innocent, son.

37
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:48,122
You have only carried out
your duty.

38
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,120
Sometimes, it is my duty
to breach my banks

39
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:57,227
to destroy the old
and initiate regeneration.

40
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,065
But when my flood waters recede

41
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:03,039
the earth becomes more fertile
and nourished.

42
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:07,134
Similarly in life,
some duties are also agonizing

43
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,239
but they give birth
only to happiness.

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,044
I too have just one wish
from the Lord, mother

45
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,282
that may He bless Dhritarashtra
and Gandhari with happiness.

46
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:21,080
By making such a big sacrifice

47
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,126
Gandhari has undoubtedly
set a new standard

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,252
to being a devoted wife.

49
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:28,059
What Kripacharya said
was absolutely true.

50
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,262
This palace has seen

51
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:36,233
many instances of sacrifices
being made by wives.

52
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:42,042
Was our sacrifice not enough?

53
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:48,175
The question is whether
what Gandhari did is a sacrifice

54
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,049
or a protest.

55
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,188
No.

56
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:57,025
I do not see this..
- What you and I see in this act

57
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,051
is irrelevant.

58
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,291
The perspective of Dhritarashtra

59
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,258
is what is important.

60
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,177
Gandhari.

61
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,984
I am right here, my Lord.

62
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:27,251
I know that.

63
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:32,185
Just by listening
to one's breathing I can know

64
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,161
how many people are present
in a chamber and where.

65
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:40,136
Come to me, Gandhari.

66
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:42,067
What?

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,104
Alright, my Lord.

68
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,125
If you go in that direction, you
will never be able to reach me.

69
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,169
You will bump into the pillar.

70
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,100
Come here.

71
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,198
Where..

72
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,099
Where are you, my Lord?

73
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,170
Just look at your foolishness.

74
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,174
If you cannot even tell
where I am

75
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,276
how could you cover your eyes?

76
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:04,245
What did you have in mind?

77
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:09,157
lnsulting me or making
a mockery of yourself?

78
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:13,253
I just want to be in the same
situation as you, my Lord.

79
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,225
How could you..

80
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,132
How could you believe..

81
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:23,266
How could you believe
that by covering your eyes

82
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,173
you could become blind?

83
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:28,075
I can see with every inch of me.

84
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,138
Gandhari

85
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:35,114
how could you be so arrogant
about your vision

86
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,278
that you deem the blind
to be helpless?

87
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:40,250
Not helpless, my Lord.

88
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,991
I consider you different
from the rest.

89
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:49,996
And I am trying to adapt
to this variation. - Fool!

90
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:53,160
What do you think?

91
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:56,138
That I wish for a court
full of blind people?

92
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:59,201
That after becoming the king

93
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:02,235
I will order everyone
to cover their eyes forever?

94
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,278
What most people cannot see
with their eyes

95
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,212
is what I can without them.

96
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:16,123
That is why, quit all this drama

97
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,150
and take off that cloth
from your eyes!

98
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:21,130
No, my Lord.
Do not say so.

99
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,159
Life becomes hell for a person
who breaks an oath.

100
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:27,193
If, because of this oath

101
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,232
I refuse to accept you

102
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,267
then will your life
not become a living hell?

103
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:36,171
To help one's wife
carry out her oath

104
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,272
is the duty of a husband,
my Lord.

105
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,280
And to carry out
the orders of a king

106
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:44,211
is the duty of every subject.

107
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:50,226
If, after my coronation,
I order you to uncover your eyes

108
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,222
then will you not do so?

109
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,996
I shall uncover my eyes then,
my Lord.

110
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:03,035
If I get such an order

111
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:08,201
I shall uncover my eyes
while stepping into the fire.

112
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,021
This means..

113
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,025
This means

114
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:31,191
you will not listen to me
under any circumstance.

115
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,038
And what is all this?

116
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:43,103
Where are you ear-rings?

117
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,211
Where are your bangles?

118
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,246
And why are you
wearing this garland?

119
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:55,157
M-My lord

120
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:59,154
I have adorned myself
with flowers

121
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,197
so that you may..
- Enough, Gandhari!

122
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,097
Enough.

123
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,260
Enough of insulting me.

124
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:14,041
Just because I cannot see
your jewellery

125
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:17,204
you have gone to this limit
to remind me of my blindness?

126
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:21,084
Have you forgotten that you are

127
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,177
the daughter-in-law
of the Kuru dynasty?

128
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:27,256
You will have to grace
the throne of Hastinapur.

129
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:31,127
Will you do so in the garb
of a female monk?

130
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:36,155
Has covering your eyes
made you believe

131
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:40,002
that the people in the court
will not be able to see you?

132
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,207
Or do you wish to keep reminding
the subjects of Hastinapur

133
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,269
that you have
met with injustice?

134
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:53,176
Is it not so, my Lord.
- It is so, Gandhari.

135
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,016
It is so.

136
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:00,990
You have come here
only to insult me.

137
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,252
As per the tradition

138
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:08,128
I had brought this ornament
for your hair, Gandhari.

139
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:14,067
It is the symbol of privilege
for every woman.

140
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:18,040
But you are unworthy of it.

141
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,269
You are unworthy.

142
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,271
You are nothing
but my abjection.

143
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,173
Nothing but my abjection!

144
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:31,211
I

145
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:35,182
son of King Vichitravirya,
Dhritarashtra

146
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:40,185
reject you.

147
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:45,168
The whole of Hastinapur
may consider you its queen

148
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:47,226
but I

149
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,100
will never accept you
as my wife.

150
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:59,013
Never!

151
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:04,253
Never.

152
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:37,245
From the beginning of time,
one particular question

153
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,246
has always bothered man.

154
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:44,126
When it comes to relationships,
gaining maximum happiness

155
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,195
and keeping sadness at bay

156
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,258
is the primary motive.

157
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,093
Have all your relationships
given you

158
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,096
complete satisfaction?

159
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,173
Think about it.

160
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:05,172
Our life is based
on relationships.

161
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:08,251
Our security is based
on relationships.

162
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:12,146
That is why, the basis
of all happiness in our life

163
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:14,154
is also a relationship.

164
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:18,285
Then why do we meet with grief
when it comes to relationships?

165
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:23,232
And why are struggles
born from relationships?

166
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,167
Have you ever thought about it?

167
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:32,105
When a person does not accept
the work or belief of another

168
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:35,009
and tries to bring about
a change in it

169
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,014
a struggle is born.

170
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,209
In other words,
the more one refuses

171
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,182
greater is the struggle.

172
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,284
And the more one accepts,
greater is the happiness.

173
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:49,123
Is it not the truth?

174
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,121
If man willingly
restrains his expectations

175
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,029
analyzes his thoughts

176
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,192
and instead of trying to change
another person

177
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:02,295
tries to bring about change
in oneself

178
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:07,232
then is achieving
satisfaction in relationships

179
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,103
that difficult a task?

180
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,172
In other words

181
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:16,118
is acceptance not the true
meaning of relationships?

182
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,022
Think about it.

183
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,313
King Dhritarashtra.

184
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:28,575
Now, even Dhritarashtra is
getting impatient to hear this.

185
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,583
And this impatience is what
I fear, Queen Mother.

186
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:39,528
Dhritarashtra has excessive
greed to rule the kingdom.

187
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,492
He dreams of filling his void
of blindness, his inadequacy

188
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,529
by ruling this kingdom.

189
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:51,474
Who does not go
through this, Bheeshma?

190
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,567
Dhritarashtra is
not at fault here.

191
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:57,505
Mother, I..

192
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:01,575
I am empathetic towards
Dhritarashtra's situation

193
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:06,447
but he has not yet been able
to accept his condition.

194
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:09,552
And if a person cannot
rise above one's pain

195
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:14,525
how will he understand the pain
of his subjects as a king?

196
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,462
We have no other alternative,
Bheeshma.

197
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,530
Dhritarashtra is the eldest son
of the Kuru dynasty.

198
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:26,273
The eldest.

199
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:31,345
But you should also understand
that he is blind.

200
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,379
If he doesn't become the king,
then what will he do?

201
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:39,546
He cannot become the General
or the Chief Minister.

202
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,548
His life will be
wasted then, Bheeshma.

203
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:48,555
As the General,
Pandu will lead the army

204
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,424
and protect him and the kingdom.

205
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,467
Vidur has extensive knowledge.

206
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,561
He will guide Dhritarashtra.

207
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:56,531
Will Dhritarashtra appoint Vidur

208
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,510
as the Chief Minister,
Queen Mother?

209
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:07,449
If, after becoming the king

210
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,421
he does not appoint someone
as the Chief Minister, then

211
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:16,551
neither will I be able to
disobey his orders

212
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:18,561
nor will you.

213
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:24,593
After the coronation ceremony,
the orders of a king

214
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:27,502
become the will of the Almighty.

215
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,568
Then before
the coronation ceremony

216
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,312
I will declare Pandu
as the General

217
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,382
and Vidur as the Chief Minister.

218
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:42,285
But to keep Hastinapur
as an integrated entity

219
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,445
it is important to coronate
Dhritarashtra as the king.

220
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:54,361
Bheeshma

221
00:15:55,332 --> 00:15:57,527
my decision to coronate
Dhritarashtra as the king

222
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:00,368
may not be palatable to you

223
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,339
but it is still
the correct decision.

224
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:07,443
Listen to me, Bheeshma.

225
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:45,439
Greetings, sire.

226
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:47,507
Welcome, Vidur.

227
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:50,376
Before swearing in
as the Chief Minister

228
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:51,547
have you come here
to take my blessings?

229
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:53,583
I have come to ask for
your permission.

230
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:55,413
Permission?

231
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,417
Regarding what, son?

232
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:00,393
To release me.

233
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,498
Release me from the duty
of taking

234
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,458
such an oath, sire.

235
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,404
The royal family of Hastinapur

236
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,365
has given the son of a maid
a great deal of love

237
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:16,309
shown him a lot of respect
and great faith, sire.

238
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:20,448
Vidur, you are the son
of King Vichitravirya

239
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,552
as are Dhritarashtra and Pandu.

240
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:25,511
I have never differentiated
among the three of you.

241
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,356
Nevertheless

242
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,417
they are the sons of queens,
sire.

243
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:32,562
If our reputation
ever gets tarnished

244
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,364
then I will be the first one
to be blamed

245
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:37,363
not them.

246
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,573
You are my disciple, son.

247
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,566
You would never do anything
to jeopardize our reputation.

248
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,310
After swearing in
as the Chief Minister

249
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:56,478
when it is time to decide
between righteousness and love

250
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:59,422
what should I choose,
sire?

251
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:02,388
Righteousness is like the sun

252
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,550
and love is like the moon.

253
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,589
If you choose love,
you will get comfort

254
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:11,296
but also the darkness
of the night.

255
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:15,571
If you choose righteousness,
there will be light

256
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:19,408
for you, your family

257
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,567
and for the subjects
of our kingdom.

258
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,381
Go on, Vidur.

259
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,554
Go and swear in
as the Chief Minister

260
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:34,584
and carry out your duties
with righteousness.

261
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:37,519
As you say, sire.

262
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,425
Goodbye.

263
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,361
May you live long.

264
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:11,675
Son, may Hastinapur
always be protected by you

265
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:12,879
and may you
always be victorious.

266
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:16,958
May your enemies shudder at
the very mention of your name.

267
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:19,918
May you be immortalized
in history, son.

268
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,896
May the rank of the General
of Hastinapur

269
00:19:22,931 --> 00:19:24,899
shine like its throne.

270
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:29,965
No other rank has the authority
to shine like the throne.

271
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:33,708
I know,
yet I shall pray

272
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,777
for your rank to shine on.

273
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:41,882
For a mother, her child's
success is her only happiness.

274
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,906
I, a descendant
of the Hastin dynasty

275
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,934
the grandson
of King Shantanu

276
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,812
and the son
of King Vichitravirya

277
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,884
take up the reins of
the kingdom of Hastinapur

278
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:54,880
in my hands today.

279
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,886
I shall extend the boundaries
of Hastinapur

280
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,925
to the very limits
of the region of Arya.

281
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:10,932
I shall take the reputation
of the Kuru dynasty

282
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,765
beyond the limits of the sky.

283
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:21,715
Hastinapur will have more wealth
than Lord Kuber himself.

284
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:23,945
All the kings
of the region of Arya

285
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:28,779
shall bow before
the throne of Hastinapur.

286
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:32,985
I.. - 'All hail
King Dhritarashtra!'

287
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,855
'All hail King Dhritarashtra!'

288
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:39,833
King Dhritarashtra!

289
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,870
Today, I take the oath

290
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:45,863
that..

291
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,803
Who dares to interrupt
my speech?
