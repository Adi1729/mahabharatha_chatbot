1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,360
The head that bows before others

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,420
has no right to bear a crown.

3
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,200
I cannot stand this
unrighteousness any longer!

4
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,400
King Dhritarashtra,
before an earthquake

5
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,160
the mere sound of its arrival

6
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,130
makes even the smallest
of birds shudder.

7
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,130
But even after hearing
of such unrighteousness

8
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,190
did your heart
not quiver even once?

9
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,130
The Almighty may not have
given you vision

10
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,360
but He certainly has
given you ears.

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,190
Unrighteousness!

12
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,200
What unrighteousness,
Great Guru Drona?

13
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,130
The rules of this game
were made in your presence.

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,360
Has anyone broken those rules?

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,290
King Dhritarashtra

16
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,100
you are indeed unable to see
the impending calamity.

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,320
Very soon, you will be
so grieved to be blind

18
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,130
which you would
have never felt before.

19
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,260
Leave this court at once,
Great Guru Drona

20
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,200
otherwise I shall take revenge
for this insult this instant!

21
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,260
Friend Duryodhan

22
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,170
now
you may bet me in the game.

23
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,200
I accept the right
you have on me

24
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,030
but I
have a request.

25
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,120
If you lose

26
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,230
then sentence me to death.

27
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,260
I cannot live the life
of a servant!

28
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,990
What are you saying,
son?

29
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,090
Father
I am standing by my friend.

30
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,970
Duryodhan my friend,
you may bet me in the game!

31
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,190
I bet my friend Ashwatthama

32
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,230
in the game.

33
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,220
He is like

34
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,030
a brother to me.

35
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,170
Great Guru Drona

36
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,070
you have been ordered
to leave this court

37
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,090
by His Highness.

38
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,000
As my son has been
bet in this game

39
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,960
I cannot leave this place.

40
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,100
Then you may certainly grace
this court, Great Guru Drona.

41
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,960
I too shall forget
how I was insulted

42
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,090
but you must promise me

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,120
that henceforth

44
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,930
you will never leave
the court of Hastinapur.

45
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,890
Promise me!

46
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,120
I promise you.

47
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,930
Then do be seated, Guru Drona.
Be seated.

48
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,100
Now, if the Emperor wishes

49
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,860
then he may bet

50
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,090
another brother of his.

51
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,830
Brother...

52
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,000
The opportunity
to get sacrificed first

53
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,930
was snatched by Nakul from me.

54
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,850
This time,
I shall bet myself.

55
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,000
No, brother Arjun.

56
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,830
It is crucial for brother Bheem
and you to stay independent.

57
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,830
Please try to understand

58
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,900
this foreboding feeling
that I have.

59
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,900
I fear that

60
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,850
something gravely unrighteous
will happen in this court today.

61
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,830
Please stop that.

62
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,900
May the Emperor have happiness!

63
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,900
Do play, Your Highness.
Do play.

64
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,820
King Ashwatthama of Kampilya

65
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,730
has been bet this time

66
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,830
and your younger brother,
the son of Lady Madri, Sahadev

67
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,990
needs to be bet by you.

68
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,790
This is not a game
but a revenge for something.

69
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,730
Sister-in-law

70
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,990
if you have an iota of shame

71
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,730
a sense of pride in your dynasty

72
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,860
or even an iota of righteousness
within yourself

73
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,800
then stop this game
this instant!

74
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,960
I...

75
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,930
I am merely an embankment
made of sand, Kunti.

76
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,830
Today, the unrighteousness
of Duryodhan

77
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
has assumed the form of a flood.

78
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,850
I will crumble

79
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,920
but will not be able
to stop this flood.

80
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,670
You are bound to crumble,
Your Highness.

81
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,920
The day your sons will be
punished for this treachery

82
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,890
you will indeed crumble.

83
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,700
I am the Empress

84
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,670
of the entire Aryan region.

85
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,920
The order to stop this game

86
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,690
shall be given by me.

87
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,660
Gatekeeper

88
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,600
the rules of the game
are very clear.

89
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,760
Women of royalty

90
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,660
are not allowed in this court!

91
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,790
Crown Prince Duryodhan

92
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,720
no order is a constraint
for an Empress.

93
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,760
Stop this game,
Your Highness.

94
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,720
This gathering is unrighteous!

95
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
This game is unrighteous!

96
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,760
Do not play this game.
Get up, Your Highness.

97
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,560
That is not possible,
Your Highness.

98
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,670
You have agreed
to play this game.

99
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,770
You are bound by your word.

100
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,730
Break that promise!

101
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,600
When an ironsmith gets entangled
in the chains while making them

102
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,600
he ends up breaking them,
Your Highness.

103
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,530
An iron chain is not
considered an ornament.

104
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,720
When the Gandiva Bow
of Prince Arjun is on your side

105
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,690
and even the mace
of Vrikodar Bheem

106
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,770
who are you afraid of then?

107
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,870
Dear Yudhishthir

108
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,010
lest you lose your throne

109
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,010
I had

110
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,850
come up with these rules

111
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,750
but now,
these very rules

112
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,920
have resulted in these
repercussions.

113
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,010
Get up, dear.

114
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,010
Get up, dear Yudhishthir.
Get up.

115
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,750
Panchali is correct,
brother Yudhishthir.

116
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Do get up.

117
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,780
Just give me the order!

118
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,750
I shall free Nakul this instant!

119
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,810
May the Emperor have happiness!

120
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,910
Your Highness, despite being
a guest in my court

121
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,820
you will attack me?

122
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Are you willing to challenge
my competence?

123
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,880
Bheem

124
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,820
it is my duty
to honour my promises.

125
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,810
I cannot order you
to resort to arms here.

126
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,850
That is your duty as a person,
brother Yudhishthir

127
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,680
and we respect it

128
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,680
but as the Emperor,
you have another duty

129
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,840
towards the Aryan region

130
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,850
and all the Kings who
have accepted your reign.

131
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,820
How will you
carry out that duty?

132
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,820
Arjun

133
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,810
it is your duty to obey the
orders of your elder brother.

134
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,650
You might as well
disregard that duty.

135
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,920
Just say that you disobey the
orders of your elder brother.

136
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,770
Nakul

137
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,750
why are you kneeling down there?

138
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,650
Your elder brother
is playing this game.

139
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,780
Why should you
accept its result?

140
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,880
Just say no.

141
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,780
None of you can give up

142
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,870
your righteous ways.

143
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,840
Do play,
Your Highness.

144
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,580
Do play.

145
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,620
I have bet Ashwatthama

146
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,650
and you need to bet Sahadev.

147
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,820
Your Highness

148
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,620
you had said that you
would lose your property

149
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,810
your empire
and even your throne

150
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,690
but you have lost
my husband instead.

151
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Is this what you call
righteousness?

152
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,580
Do play, Your Highness.
Do play.

153
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,680
Stop!

154
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,810
It is a rule

155
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,740
that in the presence
of women of royalty

156
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,580
this game shall not be played.

157
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,550
I shall stay right here.

158
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,670
May the Empress have happiness!

159
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
Your Highness,
I request you

160
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,520
to leave this court.

161
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,550
Apart from my husbands

162
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,550
I am not bound to take orders
from anyone else

163
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,580
King Dhritarashtra.

164
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,550
Splendid.

165
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,540
Splendid,
Your Highness.

166
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Splendid.

167
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,640
Your Highness, do you wish to
seek the refuge of the Empress

168
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,720
to break your promise?

169
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,640
Splendid!

170
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,580
If the foot of a person
climbing up a mountain slips

171
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,450
he ends up straight
in the trench.

172
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,540
To a righteous person

173
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,590
even the smallest
of an unrighteous deed

174
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,610
can make him fall
in the trench of sins.

175
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,540
Now, you should
order the Empress

176
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,450
to leave this court

177
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,520
otherwise

178
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,580
we shall leave.

179
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,450
My darling
let's go.

180
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,490
We must end this game.

181
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,540
My darling
let's go!

182
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,850
Stop,
brother Duryodhan.

183
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,880
Panchali
leave this court.

184
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,700
Dear Draupadi...

185
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Dear Draupadi,
what happened?

186
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,710
What happened in the court?

187
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,750
Leave!

188
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,750
It is my order

189
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,610
for the both of you to leave.

190
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,810
I require some solitude.

191
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
And no one will go to the court!

192
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,710
My husband is engaged in
honouring righteousness there.
