1
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,480
Here, master

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,520
rest your head on my thighs
and continue to rest.

3
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,610
Karna

4
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,720
I am habitual of taking rest
on stones and rocks.

5
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,520
You're habituated, master,
but it's not a necessity.

6
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,550
Give me a chance to serve you.
Please come.

7
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,650
Forgive me, master.

8
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,440
This...

9
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,610
This bug bit me
and I bled

10
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,650
hence your sleep
was disturbed.

11
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,550
Forgive me, master.

12
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,450
Oh, God!

13
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Such a deep cut!

14
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,420
Such severe pain!

15
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,650
Yet you didn't move!

16
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,390
You stayed firm!

17
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,550
No!

18
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,550
Who are you?

19
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,420
Who are you?

20
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,480
I...

21
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,320
I am your disciple, master.
- Impossible!

22
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Only a Brahman can be
my disciple.

23
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,350
And you, undoubtedly,
are not a Brahman.

24
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,380
Had you been a Brahman

25
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,350
such patience

26
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,390
and so much tolerance

27
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,390
wouldn't have been your traits.

28
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,550
Tell me honestly.
Who are you?

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
I...

30
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm not a Brahman, master.

31
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,460
I'm the son of a Suta.

32
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,320
But you had told me

33
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,550
that you're a Brahman.

34
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,310
You lied to me?

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,290
You cheated me!

36
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,480
The truth has always
humiliated me, master.

37
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,320
Had I told you

38
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,360
that I'm not a Brahman
but a Suta

39
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,480
then I'd have returned
disappointed again.

40
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,350
You fool

41
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,420
you have committed
a very big mistake.

42
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,350
If you had shared your
pain with me

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,480
then I would have definitely

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,350
sent you to a qualified teacher.

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,410
Karna

46
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,320
I am not

47
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,290
an opposer of caste
or lineage.

48
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,450
I had

49
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,520
sworn to teach only Brahmans.

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,320
My grandfather sage Rucheeka,
all his life

51
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,520
taught people of all lineages
the veneration of Lord Shiva.

52
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,390
If you had said
the truth, dear...

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,220
If you had taken
the path of truth

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,350
then you would have
definitely been benefitted.

55
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,250
Karna

56
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,310
how could you forget

57
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,220
that lies

58
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,310
are synonymous
with a weak nous?

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,220
And no form of education
in the world

60
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,410
gives results
to weaklings, dear.

61
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,390
Not at all!

62
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,220
Just like the leaves of
some trees

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,190
do sway in
the warmth of the sun

64
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,220
but wither off during
the winters...

65
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,220
Karna

66
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,310
in the same manner

67
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,350
a weak person's knowledge

68
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,250
gets destroyed at
the time of a test.

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,160
It is of no use to him.

70
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,290
This is not a curse, dear.

71
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,290
It is a reality!

72
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,150
The truth of life!

73
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,310
Go, Karna!

74
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,290
There will be a point
in your life

75
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,150
when it will be the moment of
the biggest test in your life

76
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,320
and at that very
moment

77
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,210
your knowledge
will leave your side.

78
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,420
It will disappear.

79
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,350
It will not be of
any use to you.

80
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,420
Lord Parashuram

81
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,120
I regret being unaware
of your generosity.

82
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,380
God does not differentiate
unlike the common man

83
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,280
and I couldn't comprehend it.

84
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,350
I weighed God against
the common man.

85
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,290
It was my mistake.

86
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,210
These words, that are a
result of your disappointment...

87
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,280
I accept them as your
sacrament, master.

88
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,320
Won't you
bless your disciple, Lord?

89
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,050
Your struggle

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,060
and your mistake

91
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,190
both in the times to come

92
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,180
will guide many a youth.

93
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,220
This is my blessing, dear.

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,110
May you have a long life.

95
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,190
'Near Hastinapur.'

96
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,090
'Before the princes' return
from the seminary.'

97
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,180
Go tell the king of
Gandhar Shakuni

98
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,090
that Guru Drona's son

99
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,080
Ashwatthama has come.

100
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,120
With the message of
Prince Duryodhan.

101
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
Your Highness

102
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,060
Guru Drona's son is here.
He wishes to meet you.

103
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,050
Greetings to Shakuni,
the King of Gandhar.

104
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,990
Marvellous!

105
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,950
You have applied ashes
on your body

106
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,010
and carry weapons too.

107
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,960
My past is that of a Brahman,
and my future that of a king.

108
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,020
Hence I prepare myself for
protecting both

109
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,150
my body and my soul.

110
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,120
This means, master Dronacharya
has conspired to shake off

111
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,950
the political condition of
the Arya dynasty.

112
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,950
Which state is it?

113
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,150
With time, even that shall be
revealed, Your Highness.

114
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,920
But right now, the question
is not about me

115
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,110
but my friend, Duryodhan.

116
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,010
Duryodhan said

117
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,150
'You had promised the throne
of Hastinapur, uncle.'

118
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,110
'Do you remember that or...'

119
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,920
My child!

120
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,080
My child!

121
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,990
I remember as well as
am determined for it.

122
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,890
Hence I have left Gandhar
and come here.

123
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,180
To Hastinapur.

124
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,020
For 12 years, one question
wouldn't let me sleep

125
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,120
that Guru Drona, when
starting his seminary

126
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,990
instead of imparting education
to the entire Arya dynasty

127
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,060
why did he find it appropriate
to educate

128
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,850
the princes of
only one lineage?

129
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,120
This complication is now
being resolved.

130
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,110
Only the Kuru princes will
get you a kingdom.

131
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,990
Which means your friendship
is not with Duryodhan

132
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,820
but with the throne
of Hastinapur.

133
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,920
Then I would have had
affection for Arjun.

134
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,050
My father too says that Arjun
will get me a kingdom.

135
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,890
Yes.

136
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,010
I have heard

137
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,890
that Arjun has become
a great archer.

138
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,810
But, Ashwatthama

139
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,010
the one who can get
you the kingdom

140
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,080
can snatch away
the kingdom too.

141
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,010
Hence in your heart

142
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,920
there should not be affection
towards Arjun but fear.

143
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't you have faith on
my friendship?

144
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,840
I do.

145
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,890
But in order to make your and
dear Duryodhan's friendship

146
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,950
even more stronger
I am coating it with

147
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,790
greed and fear, both.

148
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,960
See, Ashwatthama

149
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,850
the biggest political setup
of the Aryan dynasty

150
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,830
is going to begin
here at Hastinapur.

151
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,780
Hence it is necessary that

152
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,790
everyone knows their roles.

153
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,950
Tomorrow, if your father

154
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,890
begins to have affection
for the Pandavas

155
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,890
or if he talks
about righteousness

156
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,880
then at that time, it will
be beneficial for you

157
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,990
to teach your father
the lesson of greed.

158
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,720
But for that, we will first have
to make Duryodhan the king.

159
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,880
You just mind your own business.

160
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,980
Leave the rest to me.

161
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,820
Duryodhan's enthronement

162
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,950
will definitely take place.

163
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,820
At any cost.

164
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,960
At any cost!

165
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,850
Time had once defeated
me in my life.

166
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,910
Since then

167
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,920
I have always walked
ahead of the times.

168
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,530
How will I be able to recognise
the footsteps of my son

169
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,670
My lord?

170
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,530
When our sons had gone
to the seminary

171
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,700
they were children.

172
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,500
I have never seen
their faces.

173
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,630
Yet I could recognise

174
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,680
their every step.

175
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,510
Whenever Duryodhan
would enter the room

176
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,700
I could say whether he is
happy or sad.

177
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,670
Duryodhan would have
changed a lot, right?

178
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,440
Of course!

179
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,570
Definitely my Duryodhan would
have changed, Gandhari.

180
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,500
Now

181
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,510
his walk shall have
the dignity of a king.

182
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,470
And when one walks
with prestige

183
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,540
the earth recognises
that glorious footfall

184
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,570
and produces a sound
deserving of him.

185
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,570
Shakuni!

186
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,370
But there's only one question,
Your Highness.

187
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,510
Does the earth know

188
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,410
that the footsteps
that lay on it

189
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,340
are those that exude authority

190
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,400
or ambition?

191
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,470
In order to welcome Duryodhan
the sound that needs to be...

192
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,470
What if the earth

193
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
emanates the same upon
Yudhishthir's arrival?

194
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,340
Since the time of the return
of my dear nephews

195
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,430
is getting closer

196
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,570
I also came here.

197
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

198
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,540
I did not understand
the meaning

199
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,530
of your question.

200
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,310
The meaning of my question
remains the same

201
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,440
as it was 12 years ago,
Your Highness.

202
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,340
Capability!

203
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,370
The time to test capability is
getting closer, Your Highness.

204
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,500
And in order to prove dear
Duryodhan incapable...

205
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,570
There are many people
sitting alert

206
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400
in Hastinapur's palace,
Your Highness.

207
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,470
Brother!

208
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,470
Don't make the arrival of
princes a political affair.

209
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
Politics!

210
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,240
Politics!

211
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,270
I won't, dear sister.

212
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,400
But tell the same thing to

213
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,500
His Excellency Bhishm

214
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,510
and Chief Minister Vidur.

215
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,530
Because, definitely
by now

216
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,340
they would have begun to make
this a political affair.

217
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,430
Before the arrival
of the princes

218
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,280
Guru Drona will arrive to
meet His Highness.

219
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,430
Definitely,
His Excellency Bhishm

220
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,410
and Chief Minister Vidur

221
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,500
will ask him questions
on capability.

222
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,470
What is the solution?

223
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,310
There's only one solution,
Your Highness.

224
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,300
You yourself make capability
an important issue.

225
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,270
Attention!

226
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,210
King Dhritarashtra
is arriving!

227
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,330
Long live King Dhritarashtra!

228
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,410
Long live King Dhritarashtra!

229
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,470
Long live King Dhritarashtra!

230
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,440
Welcome to Hastinapur,
King of Gandhar.

231
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,370
On having met
you again

232
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,280
my heart feels at peace

233
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,330
Chief Minister.

234
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,400
Please have a seat.

235
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,140
'Are you'

236
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,270
'exiling me from
Hastinapur, Your Excellency?'

237
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,210
'It is considered appropriate'

238
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,400
'that a king stays
in his kingdom.'

239
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,180
'And the courage
to disobey my orders'

240
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,170
'does not lie
in Gandhar.'

241
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,110
'Leave!'
