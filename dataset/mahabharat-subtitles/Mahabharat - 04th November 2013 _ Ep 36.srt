1
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,490
The driver of man's life

2
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,590
is fear.

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,430
Man always succeeds in finding
a reason to be fearful.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,420
The paths we choose in our lives

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,530
are also decided out of fear.

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,490
But are these fears for real?

7
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,560
Think about it.

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,400
Fear means,
in the coming times

9
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,430
an anticipation
of trouble.

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,400
But who is the lord of time?

11
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,390
The lords of time are neither us
nor our enemies and competitors.

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,300
Time is subservient to God.

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,500
So if someone
merely plans to harm you

14
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,560
can he harm you
in actuality?

15
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,450
No.

16
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,500
But a heart filled with fear
harms us a great deal more.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,400
Is this not true?

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,490
In troubling times, a fearful
heart makes the wrong decisions

19
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,270
and makes the trouble
more agonising.

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,260
But a heart filled with faith

21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,390
overcomes troubling times
likes a breeze.

22
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,250
In other words

23
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,330
the reason for which man
harbours fear in his heart

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,200
fear acts
in complete opposition to it.

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,320
Is this not true?

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,260
Give it a thought.

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,390
Aren't these mangoes
the sweetest, brother?

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,460
Anything achieved with strength
seems sweet.

29
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,460
Go ahead and eat.

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,430
As long as your elder brother
Bhim is alive

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,460
you shall continue eating
sweet fruits.

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,430
Go ahead and eat.
- And until Duryodhan is alive

33
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,360
he shall continue making
those sweet fruits taste bitter.

34
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,400
Why are you saying so,
Duryodhan?

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,270
Your brothers shoved mine
off the trees.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,160
They stole their mangoes.

37
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,230
They insulted them.

38
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,390
He is my brother as well,
Duryodhan.

39
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,430
The way Bhim is my brother,
so are you.

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,160
And brothers need to be
taught a lesson...

41
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,260
Bhim, be quiet.

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,300
...when they become impudent.

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,320
Will you teach us a lesson?

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,260
You?

45
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,360
Who have come to our kingdom
as mere refugees?

46
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,160
Will you teach us a lesson?

47
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,160
Bhim, stop!
Bhim!

48
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,290
Duryodhan is your brother.

49
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,170
Bhim, Duryodhan, stop!

50
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,320
Stop, Prince! What kind
of a behaviour is this?

51
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,090
Release me...

52
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,060
I shall kill him today!

53
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,120
Release me.
- Stop, Prince Duryodhan!

54
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,290
Impudent Prince!

55
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,200
Like a fallen fruit

56
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,260
your wisdom is diminishing
with each passing moment.

57
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,030
How dare you behave so within
the premises of the palace?

58
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,060
You shall be punished for this.

59
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,230
Pardon us, grandsire!

60
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,030
Even Bhim
had instigated Duryodhan.

61
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,130
He is equally at fault
as Duryodhan.

62
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,290
Then both of you
shall be punished.

63
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,000
Standing in front of
the temple overnight

64
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,190
will be your act of repentance.

65
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,030
Now all of you need to
go back to your abodes.

66
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,130
Go!

67
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,000
Mother, we face a great peril.

68
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,060
No matter what you are
faced with

69
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,960
the five of you must share it.

70
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,960
Are they foolish, uncle?

71
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,020
How can someone be so happy
even after being punished?

72
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,930
They are not foolish.

73
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,090
They are devious.
Devious.

74
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,200
They have learnt the art
of fooling people.

75
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,150
When they had arrived

76
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,100
I thought you wouldn't be
too afraid of these people

77
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,090
but now...

78
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,020
But now, I am afraid of them,
beloved Duryodhan.

79
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,930
Then what must I do now, uncle?

80
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,930
Now you must
complete your act of repentance

81
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,000
along with them.

82
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,930
And think.

83
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,130
Before wearing a garland
of flowers

84
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,990
if there is even a single thorn

85
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,890
then it is wise to get rid
of it, beloved Duryodhan.

86
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,130
There are five thorns here.

87
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,930
Then these five thorns

88
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,860
need to be gotten rid of.

89
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,090
I will break them
and throw them away, uncle.

90
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,060
And first of all, I shall
deal with that Bhim.

91
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,970
I shall send him
to Death.

92
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,000
Bhim.

93
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,950
Bhim.

94
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,060
Bhim, what had
happened yesterday?

95
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,960
People were
discussing in the palace

96
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,830
that grandsire has
punished the five of you.

97
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,800
Not all of us, mother.

98
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,960
Grandsire had punished only me.

99
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,960
The rest of them
were punished by you.

100
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,930
Mother, we had come to tell you

101
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,860
when you were
worshiping the Lord.

102
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,960
You told us to share whatever
we had got.

103
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,900
That is why we meditated with
brother Bhim the whole night.

104
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,990
But what had happened?

105
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,960
Why was grandsire
compelled to punish you?

106
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,760
It was nothing, mother.

107
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,870
I just ate a few mangoes.

108
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,990
Yudhishthir, you tell me.

109
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,900
It was nothing important,
mother.

110
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,860
Yudhishthir, because I might get
angry or upset

111
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,950
these four here choose to lie.

112
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
But you never lie.

113
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,760
Tell me what had happened.

114
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,930
The truth is, mother,
that Duryodhan and the Kauravas

115
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,860
are unhappy with our arrival.

116
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,800
They intend to have us removed
at any cost.

117
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,960
Or...
- And?

118
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,890
What brother-in-law Vidur
had told me back then

119
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,760
is now making sense to me.

120
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,730
In a matter of 15 years

121
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,770
this place has
changed drastically, sons.

122
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,830
Sons, listen to me.

123
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,700
The five of you
must always stay together.

124
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,860
You must never forsake
any one of you.

125
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,800
Here, the five of you
are your only protectors.

126
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,930
I have a very bad feeling,
Yudhishthir.

127
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,920
A very bad feeling.

128
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,470
This is the poison of Gandhar,
beloved Duryodhan.

129
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,560
The forest folks of Gandhar
dip their arrows in this

130
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,570
in order to kill
even the biggest of animals

131
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,340
in just a moment.

132
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,300
Did you understand?

133
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,400
No?

134
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,330
You need not worry.

135
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,500
You will understand everything.

136
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,300
I have come up
with a plan, nephews.

137
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,430
A plan.

138
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,460
Brother Bhim,
catch that ball.

139
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,430
Brother Bhim, you can
eat 'laddoos' later.

140
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,330
First, you must pay attention
to the game.

141
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,440
What happened?
- You hurt my friend.

142
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,290
She has fainted because of you.

143
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,390
Where is she?

144
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,230
What is this?

145
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,230
In my hands.

146
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,330
That?
That is a doll.

147
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,430
No, she is my friend.

148
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,160
She is in great agony.

149
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,430
Because of you.

150
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,270
Stop crying, Dushala.

151
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,240
Now, brother Bhim will place
his hand on your friend's head

152
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,430
he will take her in his arms
and gently sway her.

153
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,430
Then she will be
rid of her pain.

154
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,230
Me?

155
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,270
Yes, brother. You must rid
our sister's friend of her pain.

156
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,200
Nakul!

157
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Do you not treasure your life?

158
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,170
Please take her in your arms
and sway her.

159
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,330
Do it, Bhim.
If it makes her

160
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,390
namely Dushala, happy then
there should be no objection.

161
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,330
Brother, you as well?

162
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,200
Dushala, why don't you
have some 'laddoos?'

163
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,340
I don't want any.
Please give her some.

164
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,390
She has fainted.

165
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,300
Stop!

166
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,330
What happened? - My friend
fainted because of him.

167
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,260
And now, he won't even
give her some 'laddoos.'

168
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,100
Be quiet, Dushala!

169
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,200
Princes do not play
this silly game of yours.

170
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,230
Return brother Bhim his ball.

171
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,260
But, brother Duryodhan,
admonish him first.

172
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,300
Return the ball else I shall
take you to mother.

173
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,390
Brother Bhim, you need not
play her silly games.

174
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,260
Return the ball.

175
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,190
Return the ball!

176
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,200
Brother Bhim, pardon Dushala.

177
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,250
She is just a little girl.

178
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,390
But even Dushashan
and I wish to apologise to you.

179
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,290
No, no.
You need not apologise for it.

180
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,130
Alright. Let me get the ball
by descending into this well.

181
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,190
No.

182
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,090
Let me go.

183
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,060
No, brother Bhim.

184
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,130
Give me this opportunity.

185
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,220
Let me descend into the well,
brother Duryodhan.
