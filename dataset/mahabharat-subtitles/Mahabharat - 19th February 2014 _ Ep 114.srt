1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,260
Have all five of you brothers
got married?

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,100
Uncle

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,160
we five brothers

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,260
have got married to Draupadi.

5
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,120
One...

6
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,070
One woman
and five husbands!

7
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,160
Hastinapur

8
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,270
and its doctrine!

9
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,190
Unrighteousness!

10
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,090
I was awaiting the advent
of righteousness

11
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,160
and you five brothers

12
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,190
have committed this blasphemy,
Yudhisthir.

13
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,030
The throne

14
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,070
that is stained even
by withered flowers...

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,230
On that pious place

16
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,970
you wish this sin

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,120
and this overt muck
to be glorified on it?

18
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,930
Grandsire...
- Arjun!

19
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,950
Uncle...

20
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,130
Come, nephews, follow me.

21
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,860
Yudhisthir's right
has been stifled.

22
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,920
Look at this balance.

23
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,800
A side of it has
the Pandavas' righteousness

24
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,960
all their good deeds.

25
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,960
We tried poisoning Bheem

26
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,830
and they forgave us.

27
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,030
You asked for the first chance
in the war with Panchal

28
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,860
and they gave you that.

29
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,950
We tried burning

30
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,970
them down in Varnavat

31
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,960
and they forgave us yet again.

32
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,930
At every step,
they upheld righteousness

33
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,930
displayed exemplary character

34
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,870
but...
- But

35
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,030
today just one misdeed
of theirs

36
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,770
has ruined
all their good deeds, uncle.

37
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,860
Just like this.

38
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,730
It seems now as if

39
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,920
God is with us.

40
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,920
You are right, friend.

41
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,790
In this unrighteous world,
maybe God and human

42
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,840
have to choose between
the severity of unrighteousness.

43
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,930
Now you have understood.

44
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,890
You thought of my deeds
as being unrighteous

45
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,690
but now

46
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,870
just have a gander at who
weighs the more in immorality.

47
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,790
I distrusted them right from
the start.

48
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,790
If they pretend to be so good
then surely

49
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
their hearts...

50
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,630
Must be maligned with
some heinous sin.

51
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,890
Uncle

52
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,630
what do we have to do now?

53
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,660
What do we...

54
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,670
What do we have to
do indeed, dear?

55
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,790
We just have to relax.

56
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,770
All that has to be done

57
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,830
will be done by that old man.

58
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,690
My dears

59
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,600
every tide that swells up
the ocean

60
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,600
when is dirtied by the sand

61
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,630
is consumed by the ocean itself.

62
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,770
Now Bhishma will announce your

63
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,770
kingship in Yudhisthir's stead.

64
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,720
King Duryodhan!

65
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,700
King Duryodhan!
- Hail him!

66
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,700
King Duryodhan!
- Hail him!

67
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,790
King Duryodhan!
- Hail him!

68
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,620
Grandsire...

69
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,750
Grandsire.

70
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,760
The Pandavas' decision

71
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,760
has many reasons behind it.

72
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,570
Sister-in-law, unknowingly

73
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,600
assigned Draupadi to
all the brothers.

74
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,690
Had Draupadi married
a single Pandava

75
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,670
the other four had to
become recluses.

76
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,730
In Kampilya
such situations arose

77
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,560
that... - That they had to
bow to unrighteousness!

78
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,660
They had to resort
to such blasphemy!

79
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
What such could be
a situation, Vidur

80
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,600
that makes unrighteousness
and blasphemy acceptable?

81
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,620
How?
How on earth?

82
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,690
Till a human being has
a way of adopting solitude

83
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,660
why would he resort to
unrighteousness or blasphemy?

84
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,730
Had Yudhisthir become a recluse

85
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,730
we'd have had to make
Duryodhan the king.

86
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,730
What difference
does it now make?

87
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,590
If anyone among
them becomes the king?

88
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,600
My Hastinapur will surely
face a downfall.

89
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,660
Righteousness will surely
be ruined.

90
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,720
Vidur

91
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,630
for years, I have safeguarded
this throne.

92
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,720
I have struggled incessantly

93
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,460
to ensure righteousness prevails
in Hastinapur.

94
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,460
Despite many challenges,
I was patient

95
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,570
because a hope lingered
in my heart

96
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,690
that a day...

97
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,670
A day would come when
God shall lend me a hand.

98
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,570
The demise of Vichitravirya

99
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,700
the battle with Lord Parashuram

100
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,650
the forest exile of Pandu

101
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,500
and then...

102
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,570
Pandu's demise.

103
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,460
Duryodhan's birth

104
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,620
the solitude
of Queen Mother Satyavati.

105
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,590
I...

106
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,600
Even after all this,
didn't give up being patient.

107
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,360
But now my patience
has given way, Vidur.

108
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,360
I...

109
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,570
I didn't expect this
from Yudhisthir!

110
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Grandsire

111
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,960
you still can't lose
your patience.

112
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,070
You are the foundation
of Hastinapur's potential.

113
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,010
The loosening of a single brick
can never bring down a palace.

114
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,970
Even if this deed of Yudhisthir

115
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,040
is considered unrighteous
and a blasphemy...

116
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,890
Still, grandsire

117
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,860
give a thought to Yudhisthir's
other virtues.

118
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,930
Silence, Vidur!
Quell your words!

119
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,030
The loosening of a single brick

120
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,840
begins the downfall of a palace.

121
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,810
This blasphemy of Yudhisthir

122
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,930
can never become acceptable
to me.

123
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,930
Never.

124
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,800
Cast your eyes there.

125
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,890
Do you know

126
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,030
that the throne of the empire

127
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,770
and the flag
differ in what ways?

128
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,840
The throne stands for potential

129
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,030
and the flag stands for hope.

130
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,030
True words, Vidur.

131
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,840
This flag is the hope
of the empire.

132
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,030
It doesn't bow
to the wind.

133
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,740
A king should be as such, Vidur

134
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,970
who, upon sighting a challenge,
livens up with energy.

135
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,810
Faces that challenge

136
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,870
rather than cowering
in its fear

137
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,000
and accepting unrighteousness
and blasphemy.

138
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,800
When this flag

139
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,760
stops fluttering in the wind,
it means

140
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,800
that the flag is torn.

141
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,930
When a king...

142
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,900
Accepts unrighteousness
and blasphemy

143
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,890
it should be considered

144
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,740
that his potential
has been ruined.

145
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,740
Today

146
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,700
Yudhisthir's potential
as a king has been ruined.

147
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,770
Now this throne

148
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,670
is out of bounds
of Yudhisthir's rights.

149
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,900
If grandsire addresses
our deed as blasphemy

150
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,900
and ousts us

151
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,670
and enthrones Duryodhan
as the king

152
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,740
we have to follow
his order.

153
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,810
In the court, grandsire
stole his eyes away from us.

154
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,940
We hadn't forsaken
Hastinapur then, brother.

155
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,930
Right after we left the court

156
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,700
we should've
forsaken Hastinapur.

157
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,630
Why did we even return
to our palace?

158
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,700
This is our home, Bheem.

159
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,670
Home is defined by the
existence of rights, brother.

160
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,640
Brother Bheem is saying
just the same.

161
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,640
The very way in which this is
our home and we have come here

162
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,740
likewise, you alone have the
right to the throne, brother.

163
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,670
You'd have to acquire the same
only by seeking.

164
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,770
Our hearts aren't
malicious either, brother.

165
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,640
The deed which appeared
a blasphemy to grandsire

166
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,860
was perfectly normal
as per Sage Vyas.

167
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,640
In so being, another question
of import is raised, brother.

168
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,730
If we follow any such order
of grandsire

169
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,700
then it would be proved
before the world

170
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,760
that we have sinned

171
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,730
and so has Draupadi.

172
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,360
If we follow any such order
of grandsire

173
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,260
then it would be proved
before the world

174
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,390
that we have sinned

175
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,350
and so has Draupadi.

176
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,360
We can't allow Draupadi's
character to be slurred thus.

177
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,360
Thus, we have to be firm
in our defence.

178
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,300
But disobeying grandsire's order
is also a sin.

179
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,160
That's the quandary I am in.

180
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,360
Draupadi
what do you opine?

181
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
The quandary that you state

182
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
has still got me perplexed,
lord.

183
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,330
Is it a danger arising
out of righteousness

184
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,190
or a danger to righteousness?

185
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,190
It would be both now.

186
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,190
Rights are righteous.

187
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,190
It's causing the danger.

188
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,130
Orders are also righteous.

189
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,220
They are in danger.

190
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,290
If you permit

191
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,220
I would like to speak
with grandsire.

192
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,190
Why?

193
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,150
Rights are decreed by
your sense of righteousness.

194
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,030
The danger arising out of that

195
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
will have to be averted by you.

196
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,990
In the court tomorrow.

197
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,220
But the danger looming
on our righteousness

198
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,090
is due to me.

199
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,190
I will find a solution to that.
