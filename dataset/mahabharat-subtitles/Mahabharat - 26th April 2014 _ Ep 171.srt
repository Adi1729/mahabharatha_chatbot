1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,320
Grandsire will not fight us
in the battlefield.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,220
He knows what his duties are.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,410
But his duty is to serve
the throne of Hastinapur.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,380
Are his principles

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,140
more important to him
than serving the throne?

6
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,210
One does not forsake one's
principles for the throne, dear.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,410
Give the sons of Pandu
what is rightfully theirs.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,120
In order to wring clothes

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,370
one can apply force
only up to a limit.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,180
One does not apply
excessive force, dear.

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,220
You have hurt
the Pandavas enough.

12
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,290
Now, returning their property
with due respect

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,340
is the righteous thing to do.

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,280
Do not let the patience
of the sons of Pandu cave in

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,120
dear Duryodhan.

16
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,350
Arjun has challenged us
to a battle.

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,180
Return them their property

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,110
and also the throne
of Yudhishthir.

19
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,350
I shall make them agree
to accept the property.

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,340
Give them

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,150
what is rightfully theirs.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,210
They will never refuse
to what I say.

23
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,180
Are you asking for mercy for
the Pandavas, Your Excellency?

24
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,240
If you are making a request

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,210
then we shall return

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,340
the Pandavas their property.

27
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,310
However

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,050
mercy cannot aid one
get the throne, can it

29
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,210
Minister?

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,050
If you are asking
for their rights

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,050
then do pardon us,
Your Excellency.

32
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,280
We cannot give them
their rights.

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,150
The sons of Pandu are capable

34
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,120
of taking their rights,
King of Gandhar.

35
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,250
The land they attack
with wrath and vengeance

36
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,180
will have to face
utter destruction.

37
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,280
Dear Dhritarashtra

38
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,140
take the correct decision.

39
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,240
End this struggle.

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,080
A struggle always has
two sides, uncle.

41
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,080
You must convince the Pandavas

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,280
to prove that it was
sundown the other day.

43
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,050
Their rights shall be returned
to them with due respect then.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,020
However,
if they attack us

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,020
then we cannot
stay quiet either.

46
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,180
Go and tell the Pandavas

47
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,080
that the right
to attack a kingdom

48
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,150
resides only with another King

49
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,990
and not with forest dwellers.

50
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,040
All hail Emperor Yudhishthir!

51
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,110
All hail Emperor Yudhishthir!

52
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,180
All hail Empress Draupadi!

53
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,940
All hail Empress Draupadi!

54
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,980
All hail Ballav Maharaj!

55
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,020
Because you gave us refuge

56
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,850
your kingdom was attacked,
Your Highness.

57
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,040
Emperor Yudhishthir

58
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,980
when a piece of gold is shaped,
it transforms into an ornament.

59
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,940
By spending your life
of anonymity in my kingdom

60
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,920
you have sanctified
my entire household.

61
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
The army of the Matsya kingdom
is prepared.

62
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,920
The moment you give the order

63
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,980
we shall attack Hastinapur.

64
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,850
You have indebted us
with your love, Your Highness.

65
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,820
A twig within a whirlwind with
the intent of touching the sky

66
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,910
has no competence of its own.

67
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,910
No

68
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,090
the armies will not fight,
Your Highness.

69
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,790
We five brothers took an oath
solely based upon our competence

70
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,820
and we shall use it

71
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,970
to fulfill our vows.

72
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,850
Very soon,
only five chariots

73
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,940
will be standing
at the gates of Hastinapur.

74
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,780
To punish the hundred
sons of King Dhritarashtra!

75
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,910
Not hundred,
Panchali.

76
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,850
Hundred and one,
Panchali.

77
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,920
Have a message
sent to Hastinapur.

78
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,850
The basis of unrighteousness
of Crown Prince Duryodhan

79
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,750
is the competence
of King Karna of Anga.

80
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,910
The sons of Pandu will sacrifice
hundred and one people.

81
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,870
The way

82
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,780
hundred and one fruits
of the Golden Apple Tree

83
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,790
are offered to Lord Shiva
for worship

84
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,010
similarly

85
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,820
tomorrow at dawn

86
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,750
hundred and one severed heads

87
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,940
will be presented to
the Deity of the Battlefield

88
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,940
Kala Bhairav* as an offering.
*The fierce manifestation of Shiva associated with annihilation.

89
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,980
'Tomorrow at dawn,
hundred and one severed heads'

90
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,950
'will be presented to
the Deity of the Battlefield'

91
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,750
'Kala Bhairav as an offering.'

92
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,890
How dare the sons of Pandu

93
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,910
challenge me to a battle?!

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I shall render
the people sleepless

95
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,910
who dream of beheading me.

96
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,820
Forever!

97
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,850
Forever.

98
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,950
By accepting the heads
of the Pandavas, Kala Bhairav

99
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,920
will have to be contented,
friend.

100
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,850
Anyone who attacks you

101
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,940
shall be slain by me.

102
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,690
Have faith in my competence.

103
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,650
Why are you getting so excited,
King Karna of Anga?

104
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,710
The right to fight
on behalf of Hastinapur

105
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,780
has not been given to you yet

106
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,780
because

107
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,810
the other term for 'rights'

108
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,680
is 'responsibilities.'

109
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,770
With the grace of the Almighty

110
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,810
this right

111
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,610
resides with the most competent
person of this world

112
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,690
and the most powerful General

113
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,650
His Excellency Bhishma.

114
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,840
Impossible!

115
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,880
The challenge is for the hundred
sons of Dhritarashtra

116
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,810
and not Hastinapur!

117
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,880
Challenge?

118
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,670
Challenge...

119
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,880
This is not a challenge,
Your Excellency Bhishma.

120
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,650
This is a protest.

121
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,740
A protest of slaves!

122
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,590
Do something,
Your Excellency.

123
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,810
Do something.

124
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,720
Whether the life of anonymity
of the Pandavas

125
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,840
was successful or not

126
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,650
has not yet been proved by them

127
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,840
in any manner.

128
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,690
That day,
the sunlight

129
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,650
had not faded,
grandsire.

130
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,780
Even when the sun goes down

131
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,740
and the sunlight is visible

132
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,740
it is still called

133
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,690
dusk,
grandsire

134
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,550
and not night.

135
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,640
When one cannot see the sun

136
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,670
while standing
in a particular place

137
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,690
it is deemed

138
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,590
the end of the day
for that particular place.

139
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,650
Now,
this question

140
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,520
is of righteousness,
Your Excellency Bhishma.

141
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,710
Who is the one

142
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,520
who gets to decide

143
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,610
whether it was night

144
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,590
or day,
Your Excellency?

145
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,720
You?

146
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,520
Yudhishthir?
Me?

147
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,670
Who?

148
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,640
In other words

149
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,750
their challenge and attack

150
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,520
are both acts
of unrighteousness.

151
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,750
Now, you must decide,
Your Excellency Bhishma

152
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,540
whether you

153
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,640
wish to take the side
of righteous people

154
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,510
or that

155
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,580
of that family.

156
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
You must leave

157
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,520
bearing righteousness within you
and weapons in your arms

158
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,570
My Lords.

159
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Righteousness is on your side.

160
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,520
Become the weapons
of the Almighty

161
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,590
to slay the sinners!

162
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,030
Uncle, tomorrow at dawn,
the sons of Pandu

163
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,120
will enter Hastinapur.

164
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:33,030
When Hastinapur will echo
with the sound of a battle cry

165
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,060
we will have to hoist either
of the flags, uncle.

166
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,120
The white flag of peace

167
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,050
or the red flag of war.

168
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,030
Hastinapur has emerged
victorious

169
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,960
for the past
seven generations, uncle.

170
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,060
If the sons of Pandu win

171
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,030
then the honour of Hastinapur
will get annihilated.

172
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,100
However,
if the sons of Pandu lose

173
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,160
then the entire Aryan region

174
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,190
will be robbed of righteousness.

175
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,060
I have taken an oath to protect
the throne of Hastinapur

176
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,060
Vidur.

177
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,960
If the sons of Pandu

178
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,090
lose then my dream will break.

179
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,060
Either way,
I end up being defeated.

180
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,960
Only the sons of Pandu

181
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,090
can safeguard my principles.

182
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,890
However, my principles

183
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,950
cannot safeguard
the sons of Pandu.

184
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,990
Till this old man
continues to stand

185
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,790
in front of the Pandavas

186
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,920
the Pandavas are bound
to be defeated.

187
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,690
Are you here
to fight a battle, son?

188
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,820
In reply

189
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,830
even I have waived
off the red flag.

190
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,760
I am the actual stronghold
of Hastinapur.

191
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,850
If you're competent enough

192
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,920
then try breaking
this bastion.

193
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Lift your weapons,
Pandavas.

194
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,920
In reply of your summon
Hastinapur's defender

195
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,860
is present here before you.

196
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,850
No, grandsire.

197
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,860
I cannot shoot an arrow at you.
- Then accept defeat, Arjun

198
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,890
and return.

199
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,660
I am confined
to the throne of Hastinapur.

200
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,630
If Hastinapur is ever attacked

201
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,650
I will definitely be present
to defend it.

202
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,730
You too raise your weapons.

203
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,520
If Hastinapur is ever attacked

204
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,550
I will definitely be present
do defend it.

205
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,420
You too raise your weapons.

206
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,320
The summon was
for the Kauravas

207
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,290
and not the entire
Hastinapur, grandsire.

208
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,250
There are not courageous enough
to even accept this!

209
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,290
Then based on what powers
did they commit a crime.

210
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,380
Based on my powers,
Bhima.

211
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,450
My powers.

212
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,260
It's very unfortunate
for me

213
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,320
that my righteousness
serves as a shield

214
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,420
to many unrighteous deeds.

215
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
We're not here to fight
a battle with you, grandsire.

216
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,220
Hence we sent the summon

217
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,220
only to King
Dhritarashtra's sons

218
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,360
and the king of Anga,
Karna.

219
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,330
Your summon
for a battle

220
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,330
has not been accepted
by Dhritarashtra's sons.

221
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,390
If they do not come
to fight a battle with you

222
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,260
then what will you do?

223
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,220
We will be forced
to break the fort

224
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,260
and that will be considered
an attack on Hastinapur.

225
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,320
Guru Drona and you will
raise your weapons against us

226
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,220
and we will have
to fight you.

227
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,220
This means, grandsire,
that the circumstances are

228
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,380
that either we forget about
our humiliation

229
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,190
forget about our wealth
and reside in the forests.

230
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,430
Or we attack you.

231
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,260
Why this dilemma?
Why this dilemma, grandsire?

232
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,290
You very well know,
grandsire

233
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,410
that we're on the side
of righteousness.

234
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,260
The cruel behaviour that
Kauravas showed towards us

235
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,260
towards your daughter-in-law...

236
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,160
Is it not important
to punish them?

237
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,150
Why are you protecting them?

238
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,160
I have no remedy, son.

239
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,380
The outer cover
of the coconut

240
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,330
cannot sacrifice his stiffness.

241
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,390
Even if the water within
the coconut dries

242
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,120
not even then.

243
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,250
I will have to carry out
my duties.
