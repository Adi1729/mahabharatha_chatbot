1
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,790
Kunti!

2
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,570
Arjun!

3
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,660
Yudhishthir, Bheem,
Nakul, Sahadev!

4
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,430
No!

5
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,570
No!

6
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,090
Mother

7
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,000
Bhagirath had brought you
to the earth from heaven

8
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,160
so that his subjects could

9
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,100
offer the ashes of their
beloved deceased in your waters

10
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,960
and pray for their salvation.

11
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,000
Have you ever seen
an unfortunate event

12
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,940
when a person came
to offer his own ashes?

13
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,020
Today, I am here, mother

14
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,160
to offer you my own ashes

15
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,100
and pray for my salvation.

16
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,540
These are my ashes, mother.

17
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,470
The way the skeletons
are the basis of a body

18
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,410
the sons of Pandu
were the basis of my life.

19
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,440
They were the basis
of all my hopes.

20
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,340
They were the basis of the
future of my kingdom's subjects.

21
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,430
The leaves of a tree
may fall off

22
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,280
but its roots can
never attain liberation.

23
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,210
You are the root of the
tree of righteousness, uncle.

24
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,230
How can you attain liberation?

25
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
The tree has fallen, Vidur.

26
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,370
Hastinapur's tree
of righteousness fell today.

27
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
It fell.

28
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,370
Every inch of me is burning
with anger and dejection.

29
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,330
I feel like following
Lord Parashuram's example

30
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,270
by drawing my weapons

31
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,330
and destroying the entire
Kuru dynasty!

32
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,210
I feel like punishing
Duryodhan and his brothers

33
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,270
in such a manner
that they repent

34
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,340
for their sins
till the end of time!

35
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,300
I feel like following
Lord Parashuram's example

36
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,070
and punishing Duryodhan
and his brothers

37
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,330
in such a manner
that they repent

38
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,130
for their sins
till the end of time!

39
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
But I...

40
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,290
But I cannot do so, Vidur.

41
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,060
I...

42
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,160
I am helpless.

43
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,040
Even if one's child is a sinner

44
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,060
one cannot kill it
with one's hands.

45
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,030
Now, my heart

46
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,190
hopes for nothing in this world.

47
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,260
My end must be near.

48
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
No, uncle!

49
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,090
I have faith

50
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,170
in your merits and in that
of my ancestors.

51
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,070
The tree of righteousness
can never fall.

52
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,100
But just for a little while

53
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,000
it has been clouded by
the mist of unrighteousness.

54
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,090
But when the time is right

55
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,140
that mist will certainly
clear up, uncle

56
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,230
and that tree will be
visible once again.

57
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,020
How?

58
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,030
How, Vidur?
How?

59
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,130
I had a suspicion, uncle

60
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,070
that Duryodhan and

61
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,970
the King of Gandhar, Shakuni

62
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,000
had hatched a conspiracy
in Varnavrat.

63
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,230
I had informed Yudhishthir
about the same, uncle.

64
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,120
Does this mean

65
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,130
that the sons of Pandu
are alive?

66
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,190
They must certainly be, uncle.

67
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,970
Rahu can swallow the sun
only for a few moments

68
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,930
but not forever.

69
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,000
They must certainly
be alive, uncle.

70
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,090
And when the time is right,
they will show themselves.

71
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,100
Arjun

72
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,060
we cannot look like
Princes any longer.

73
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,060
If the news of our survival
reaches Hastinapur

74
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,930
then a search party
will be sent for us.

75
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,890
Brother Yudhishthir

76
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,100
we should give up
our kingly clothes

77
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,890
and dress up as ascetics.

78
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,860
That's a sensible idea.

79
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
We will dress up
as 'Brahmins' and sages

80
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,800
and proceed to the West.

81
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,070
After travelling for a few days

82
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,900
we will reach the place

83
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,900
where father and mother Madri
have been commemorated.

84
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,860
The place where
our lives had begun.
